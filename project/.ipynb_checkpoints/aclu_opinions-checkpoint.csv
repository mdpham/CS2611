28521,per_curiam,per_curiam,True,Taylor v. Louisiana,,1962,2.0,"Petitioners, six Negroes, were convicted of violating Louisiana's breach-of-the-peace statute, La. Rev. Stat., 1950, § 14:103.1,[1] and were given fines and jail terms by *155 the state court. The Louisiana Supreme Court declined to review their convictions, and the case is here on petition for a writ of certiorari which we have granted.
Four of the six petitioners went into the waiting room customarily reserved for white people at the Trailways Bus Depot in Shreveport, Louisiana, in order to take a bus to Jackson, Mississippi. The Chief of Police of Shreveport approached the four and asked them why they were in the station. They told him they were interstate passengers and wished to purchase tickets and obtain travel information. The Chief told them they could do this in the colored waiting room and ordered them to move on. When the four refused to leave, stating again that they were interstate passengers and asserting their rights under federal law, they were ordered to leave or be arrested. The spokesman of the group then said, ""We have no choice; go ahead and arrest us."" The police thereupon arrested the four of them. The other two petitioners were then arrested, while sitting nearby in the automobile which had brought the six to the bus station.
At the trial there was testimony that immediately upon petitioners' entry into the waiting room many of the people therein became restless and that some onlookers climbed onto seats to get a better view. Nevertheless, respondent admits these persons moved on when ordered to do so by the police. There was no evidence of violence. The record shows that the petitioners were quiet, orderly, and polite. The trial court said, however, that the mere presence of Negroes in a white waiting room was likely to give rise to a breach of the peace. It held the mere presence of the Negroes in the waiting room, as part *156 of a preconceived plan, was sufficient evidence of guilt. It accordingly held that the four had violated the state breach-of-the-peace statute and that the other two had counseled and procured the others to commit the crime.
Here, as in Garner v. Louisiana, 368 U.S. 157, the only evidence to support the charge was that petitioners were violating a custom that segregated people in waiting rooms according to their race, a practice not allowed in interstate transportation facilities by reason of federal law.[2]Boynton v. Virginia, 364 U.S. 454, 459-460. And see Mayor & City Council of Baltimore v. Dawson, 350 U.S. 877 (public beaches); Holmes v. City of Atlanta, 350 U.S. 879 (municipal golf courses); Gayle v. Browder, 352 U.S. 903 (bus); New Orleans Park Assn. v. Detiege, 358 U.S. 54 (municipal golf course and park). The judgments of conviction must therefore be
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN would grant certiorari and set the case for argument.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
"
29314,Justice Stewart,second_dissenting,False,Griswold v. Connecticut,,1965,2.0,"Since 1879 Connecticut has had on its books a law which forbids the use of contraceptives by anyone. I think this is an uncommonly silly law. As a practical matter, the law is obviously unenforceable, except in the oblique context of the present case. As a philosophical matter, I believe the use of contraceptives in the relationship of marriage should be left to personal and private choice, based upon each individual's moral, ethical, and religious beliefs. As a matter of social policy, I think professional counsel about methods of birth control should be available to all, so that each individual's choice can be meaningfully made. But we are not asked in this case to say whether we think this law is unwise, or even asinine. We are asked to hold that it violates the United States Constitution. And that I cannot do.
In the course of its opinion the Court refers to no less than six Amendments to the Constitution: the First, the Third, the Fourth, the Fifth, the Ninth, and the Fourteenth. *528 But the Court does not say which of these Amendments, if any, it thinks is infringed by this Connecticut law.
We are told that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not, as such, the ""guide"" in this case. With that much I agree. There is no claim that this law, duly enacted by the Connecticut Legislature is unconstitutionally vague. There is no claim that the appellants were denied any of the elements of procedural due process at their trial, so as to make their convictions constitutionally invalid. And, as the Court says, the day has long passed since the Due Process Clause was regarded as a proper instrument for determining ""the wisdom, need, and propriety"" of state laws. Compare Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, with Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726. My Brothers HARLAN and WHITE to the contrary, ""[w]e have returned to the original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies, who are elected to pass laws."" Ferguson v. Skrupa, supra, at 730.
As to the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments, I can find nothing in any of them to invalidate this Connecticut law, even assuming that all those Amendments are fully applicable against the States.[1] It has *529 not even been argued that this is a law ""respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.""[2] And surely, unless the solemn process of constitutional adjudication is to descend to the level of a play on words, there is not involved here any abridgment of ""the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""[3] No soldier has been quartered in any house.[4] There has been no search, and no seizure.[5] Nobody has been compelled to be a witness against himself.[6]
The Court also quotes the Ninth Amendment, and my Brother GOLDBERG'S concurring opinion relies heavily upon it. But to say that the Ninth Amendment has anything to do with this case is to turn somersaults with history. The Ninth Amendment, like its companion the Tenth, which this Court held ""states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered,"" United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 124, was framed by James Madison and adopted by the States simply to make clear that the adoption of the Bill of Rights did not alter the plan that *530 the Federal Government was to be a government of express and limited powers, and that all rights and powers not delegated to it were retained by the people and the individual States. Until today no member of this Court has ever suggested that the Ninth Amendment meant anything else, and the idea that a federal court could ever use the Ninth Amendment to annual a law passed by the elected representatives of the people of the State of Connecticut would have caused James Madison no little wonder.
What provision of the Constitution, then, does make this state law invalid? The Court says it is the right of privacy ""created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees."" With all deference, I can find no such general right of privacy in the Bill of Rights, in any other part of the Constitution, or in any case ever before decided by this Court.[7]
At the oral argument in this case we were told that the Connecticut law does not ""conform to current community standards."" But it is not the function of this Court to decide cases on the basis of community standards. We are here to decide cases ""agreeably to the Constitution and laws of the United States."" It is the essence of judicial *531 duty to subordinate our own personal views, our own ideas of what legislation is wise and what is not. If, as I should surely hope, the law before us does not reflect the standards of the people of Connecticut, the people of Connecticut can freely exercise their true Ninth and Tenth Amendment rights to persuade their elected representatives to repeal it. That is the constitutional way to take this law off the books.[8]
"
29313,Justice Black,dissenting,False,Griswold v. Connecticut,,1965,2.0,"I agree with my Brother STEWART'S dissenting opinion. And like him I do not to any extent whatever base my view that this Connecticut law is constitutional on a belief that the law is wise or that its policy is a good one. In order that there may be no room at all to doubt why I vote as I do, I feel constrained to add that the law is every bit as offensive to me as it is to my Brethren of the majority and my Brothers HARLAN, WHITE and GOLDBERG who, reciting reasons why it is offensive to them, hold it unconstitutional. There is no single one of the graphic and eloquent strictures and criticisms fired at the policy of this Connecticut law either by the Court's opinion or by those of my concurring Brethren to which I cannot subscribeexcept their conclusion that the evil qualities they see in the law make it unconstitutional.
Had the doctor defendant here, or even the nondoctor defendant, been convicted for doing nothing more than expressing opinions to persons coming to the clinic that certain contraceptive devices, medicines or practices would do them good and would be desirable, or for telling people how devices could be used, I can think of no reasons at this time why their expressions of views would not be *508 protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, which guarantee freedom of speech. Cf. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar, 377 U.S. 1; NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415. But speech is one thing; conduct and physical activities are quite another. See, e. g., Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536, 554-555; Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 559, 563-564; id., 575-584 (concurring opinion); Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U.S. 490; cf. Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 163-164. The two defendants here were active participants in an organization which gave physical examinations to women, advised them what kind of contraceptive devices or medicines would most likely be satisfactory for them, and then supplied the devices themselves, all for a graduated scale of fees, based on the family income. Thus these defendants admittedly engaged with others in a planned course of conduct to help people violate the Connecticut law. Merely because some speech was used in carrying on that conductjust as in ordinary life some speech accompanies most kinds of conductwe are not in my view justified in holding that the First Amendment forbids the State to punish their conduct. Strongly as I desire to protect all First Amendment freedoms, I am unable to stretch the Amendment so as to afford protection to the conduct of these defendants in violating the Connecticut law. What would be the constitutional fate of the law if hereafter applied to punish nothing but speech is, as I have said, quite another matter.
The Court talks about a constitutional ""right of privacy"" as though there is some constitutional provision or provisions forbidding any law ever to be passed which might abridge the ""privacy"" of individuals. But there is not. There are, of course, guarantees in certain specific constitutional provisions which are designed in part to protect privacy at certain times and places with respect to certain activities. Such, for example, is the Fourth *509 Amendment's guarantee against ""unreasonable searches and seizures."" But I think it belittles that Amendment to talk about it as though it protects nothing but ""privacy."" To treat it that way is to give it a niggardly interpretation, not the kind of liberal reading I think any Bill of Rights provision should be given. The average man would very likely not have his feelings soothed any more by having his property seized openly than by having it seized privately and by stealth. He simply wants his property left alone. And a person can be just as much, if not more, irritated, annoyed and injured by an unceremonious public arrest by a policeman as he is by a seizure in the privacy of his office or home.
One of the most effective ways of diluting or expanding a constitutionally guaranteed right is to substitute for the crucial word or words of a constitutional guarantee another word or words, more or less flexible and more or less restricted in meaning. This fact is well illustrated by the use of the term ""right of privacy"" as a comprehensive substitute for the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against ""unreasonable searches and seizures."" ""Privacy"" is a broad, abstract and ambiguous concept which can easily be shrunken in meaning but which can also, on the other hand, easily be interpreted as a constitutional ban against many things other than searches and seizures. I have expressed the view many times that First Amendment freedoms, for example, have suffered from a failure of the courts to stick to the simple language of the First Amendment in construing it, instead of invoking multitudes of words substituted for those the Framers used. See e. g., New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 293 (concurring opinion); cases collected in City of El Paso v. Simmons, 379 U.S. 497, 517, n. 1 (dissenting opinion); Black, The Bill of Rights, 35 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 865. For these reasons I get nowhere in this case by talk about a constitutional ""right of privacy"" as an emanation from *510 one or more constitutional provisions.[1] I like my privacy as well as the next one, but I am nevertheless compelled to admit that government has a right to invade it unless prohibited by some specific constitutional provision. For these reasons I cannot agree with the Court's judgment and the reasons it gives for holding this Connecticut law unconstitutional.
This brings me to the arguments made by my Brothers HARLAN, WHITE and GOLDBERG for invalidating the Connecticut law. Brothers HARLAN[2] and WHITE would invalidate it by reliance on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but Brother GOLDBERG, while agreeing with Brother HARLAN, relies also on the Ninth Amendment. I have no doubt that the Connecticut law could be applied in such a way as to abridge freedom of *511 speech and press and therefore violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments. My disagreement with the Court's opinion holding that there is such a violation here is a narrow one, relating to the application of the First Amendment to the facts and circumstances of this particular case. But my disagreement with Brothers HARLAN, WHITE and GOLDBERG is more basic. I think that if properly construed neither the Due Process Clause nor the Ninth Amendment, nor both together, could under any circumstances be a proper basis for invalidating the Connecticut law. I discuss the due process and Ninth Amendment arguments together because on analysis they turn out to be the same thingmerely using different words to claim for this Court and the federal judiciary power to invalidate any legislative act which the judges find irrational, unreasonable or offensive.
The due process argument which my Brothers HARLAN and WHITE adopt here is based, as their opinions indicate, on the premise that this Court is vested with power to invalidate all state laws that it considers to be arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or oppressive, or on this Court's belief that a particular state law under scrutiny has no ""rational or justifying"" purpose, or is offensive to a ""sense of fairness and justice.""[3] If these formulas based on ""natural justice,"" or others which mean the same thing,[4] are to prevail, they require judges to determine *512 what is or is not constitutional on the basis of their own appraisal of what laws are unwise or unnecessary. The power to make such decisions is of course that of a legislative body. Surely it has to be admitted that no provision of the Constitution specifically gives such blanket power to courts to exercise such a supervisory veto over the wisdom and value of legislative policies and to hold unconstitutional those laws which they believe unwise or dangerous. I readily admit that no legislative body, state or national, should pass laws that can justly be given any *513 of the invidious labels invoked as constitutional excuses to strike down state laws. But perhaps it is not too much to say that no legislative body ever does pass laws without believing that they will accomplish a sane, rational, wise and justifiable purpose. While I completely subscribe to the holding of Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, and subsequent cases, that our Court has constitutional power to strike down statutes, state or federal, that violate commands of the Federal Constitution, I do not believe that we are granted power by the Due Process Clause or any other constitutional provision or provisions to measure constitutionality by our belief that legislation is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable, or accomplishes no justifiable purpose, or is offensive to our own notions of ""civilized standards of conduct.""[5] Such an appraisal of the wisdom of legislation is an attribute of the power to make laws, not of the power to interpret them. The use by federal courts of such a formula or doctrine or whatnot to veto federal or state laws simply takes away from Congress and States the power to make laws based on their own judgment of fairness and wisdom and transfers that power to this Court for ultimate determination a power which was specifically denied to federal courts by the convention that framed the Constitution.[6]
*514 Of the cases on which my Brothers WHITE and GOLDBERG rely so heavily, undoubtedly the reasoning of two of them supports their result hereas would that of a number of others which they do not bother to name, e. g., *515 Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U.S. 1, Jay Burns Baking Co. v. Bryan, 264 U.S. 504, and Adkins v. Children's Hospital, 261 U.S. 525. The two they do cite and quote from, Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, and Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, were both decided in opinions by Mr. Justice McReynolds which elaborated the same natural law due process philosophy found in Lochner v. New York, supra, one of the cases on which he relied in Meyer, along with such other long-discredited decisions as, e. g., Adams v. Tanner, 244 U.S. 590, and Adkins v. Children's Hospital, supra. Meyer held unconstitutional, as an ""arbitrary"" and unreasonable interference with the right of a teacher to carry on his occupation and of parents to hire him, a *516 state law forbidding the teaching of modern foreign languages to young children in the schools.[7] And in Pierce, relying principally on Meyer, Mr. Justice McReynolds said that a state law requiring that all children attend public schools interfered unconstitutionally with the property rights of private school corporations because it was an ""arbitrary, unreasonable and unlawful interference"" which threatened ""destruction of their business and property."" 268 U.S., at 536. Without expressing an opinion as to whether either of those cases reached a correct result in light of our later decisions applying the First Amendment to the State through the Fourteenth,[8] I merely point out that the reasoning stated in Meyer and Pierce was the same natural law due process philosophy which many later opinions repudiated, and which I cannot accept. Brothers WHITE and GOLDBERG also cite other cases, such as NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, and Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147, which held that States in regulating conduct could not, consistently with the First Amendment as applied to them by the Fourteenth, pass unnecessarily broad laws which might indirectly infringe on First Amendment freedoms.[9] See Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. *517 Virginia State Bar, 377 U.S. 1, 7-8.[10] Brothers WHITE and GOLDBERG now apparently would start from this requirement that laws be narrowly drafted so as not to curtail free speech and assembly, and extend it limitlessly to require States to justify any law restricting ""liberty"" as my Brethren define ""liberty."" This would mean at the *518 very least, I suppose, that every state criminal statute since it must inevitably curtail ""liberty"" to some extent would be suspect, and would have to be justified to this Court.[11]
My Brother GOLDBERG has adopted the recent discovery[12] that the Ninth Amendment as well as the Due Process Clause can be used by this Court as authority to strike down all state legislation which this Court thinks *519 violates ""fundamental principles of liberty and justice,"" or is contrary to the ""traditions and [collective] conscience of our people."" He also states, without proof satisfactory to me, that in making decisions on this basis judges will not consider ""their personal and private notions."" One may ask how they can avoid considering them. Our Court certainly has no machinery with which to take a Gallup Poll.[13] And the scientific miracles of this age have not yet produced a gadget which the Court can use to determine what traditions are rooted in the ""[collective] conscience of our people."" Moreover, one would certainly have to look far beyond the language of the Ninth Amendment[14] to find that the Framers vested in this Court any such awesome veto powers over lawmaking, either by the States or by the Congress. Nor does anything in the history of the Amendment offer any support for such a shocking doctrine. The whole history of the adoption of the Constitution and Bill of Rights points the other way, and the very material quoted by my Bother GOLDBERG shows that the Ninth Amendment was intended to protect against the idea that ""by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power"" to the Federal Government, ""those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government [the United States], and were consequently *520 insecure.""[15] That Amendment was passed, not to broaden the powers of this Court or any other department of ""the General Government,"" but, as every student of history knows, to assure the people that the Constitution in all its provisions was intended to limit the Federal Government to the powers granted expressly or by necessary implication. If any broad, unlimited power to hold laws unconstitutional because they offend what this Court conceives to be the ""[collective] conscience of our people"" is vested in this Court by the Ninth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, or any other provision of the Constitution, it was not given by the Framers, but rather has been bestowed on the Court by the Court. This fact is perhaps responsible for the peculiar phenomenon that for a period of a century and a half no serious suggestion was ever made that the Ninth Amendment, enacted to protect state powers against federal invasion, could be used as a weapon of federal power to prevent state legislatures from passing laws they consider appropriate to govern local affairs. Use of any such broad, unbounded judicial authority would make of this Court's members a day-to-day constitutional convention.
I repeat so as not to be misunderstood that this Court does have power, which it should exercise, to hold laws unconstitutional where they are forbidden by the Federal Constitution. My point is that there is no provision *521 of the Constitution which either expressly or impliedly vests power in this Court to sit as a supervisory agency over acts of duly constituted legislative bodies and set aside their laws because of the Court's belief that the legislative policies adopted are unreasonable, unwise, arbitrary, capricious or irrational. The adoption of such a loose, flexible, uncontrolled standard for holding laws unconstitutional, if ever it is finally achieved, will amount to a great unconstitutional shift of power to the courts which I believe and am constrained to say will be bad for the courts and worse for the country. Subjecting federal and state laws to such an unrestrained and unrestrainable judicial control as to the wisdom of legislative enactments would, I fear, jeopardize the separation of governmental powers that the Framers set up and at the same time threaten to take away much of the power of States to govern themselves which the Constitution plainly intended them to have.[16]
*522 I realize that many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, sometimes in rhapsodical strains, about the duty of this Court to keep the Constitution in tune with the times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must with all deference reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and being somewhat old-fashioned I must add it is good enough for me. And so, I cannot rely on the Due Process Clause or the Ninth Amendment or any mysterious and uncertain natural law concept as a reason for striking down this state law. The Due Process Clause with an ""arbitrary and capricious"" or ""shocking to the conscience"" formula was liberally used by this Court to strike down economic legislation in the early decades of this century, threatening, many people thought, the tranquility and stability of the Nation. See, e. g., Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45. That formula, based on subjective considerations of ""natural justice,"" is no less dangerous when used to enforce this Court's views about personal rights than those about economic rights. I had thought that we had laid that formula, as a means for striking down state legislation, to rest once and for all in cases like West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379; Olsen v. Nebraska ex rel. Western Reference & Bond Assn., 313 U.S. 236, and many other *523 opinions.[17] See also Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 74 (Holmes, J., dissenting).
In Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726, 730, this Court two years ago said in an opinion joined by all the Justices but one[18] that
""The doctrine that prevailed in Lochner, Coppage, Adkins, Burns, and like casesthat due process authorizes courts to hold laws unconstitutional when they believe the legislature has acted unwiselyhas long since been discarded. We have returned to the original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies, who are elected to pass laws.""
And only six weeks ago, without even bothering to hear argument, this Court overruled Tyson & Brother v. Banton, 273 U.S. 418, which had held state laws regulating ticket brokers to be a denial of due process of law.[19]Gold *524 v. DiCarlo, 380 U.S. 520. I find April's holding hard to square with what my concurring Brethren urge today. They would reinstate the Lochner, Coppage, Adkins, Burns line of cases, cases from which this Court recoiled after the 1930's, and which had been I thought totally discredited until now. Apparently my Brethren have less quarrel with state economic regulations than former Justices of their persuasion had. But any limitation upon their using the natural law due process philosophy to strike down any state law, dealing with any activity whatever, will obviously be only self-imposed.[20]
In 1798, when this Court was asked to hold another Connecticut law unconstitutional, Justice Iredell said:
""[I]t has been the policy of all the American states, which have, individually, framed their state constitutions since the revolution, and of the people of the United States, when they framed the Federal Constitution, to define with precision the objects of the legislative power, and to restrain its exercise within marked and settled boundaries. If any act of Congress, or of the Legislature of a state, violates those constitutional provisions, it is unquestionably void; though, I admit, that as the authority to declare it void is of a delicate and awful nature, the Court will never resort to that authority, but in a clear and urgent case. If, on the other hand, the Legislature of the Union, or the Legislature of any member of the Union, shall pass a law, within the *525 general scope of their constitutional power, the Court cannot pronounce it to be void, merely because it is, in their judgment, contrary to the principles of natural justice. The ideas of natural justice are regulated by no fixed standard: the ablest and the purest men have differed upon the subject; and all that the Court could properly say, in such an event, would be, that the Legislature (possessed of an equal right of opinion) had passed an act which, in the opinion of the judges, was inconsistent with the abstract principles of natural justice."" Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 399 (emphasis in original).
I would adhere to that constitutional philosophy in passing on this Connecticut law today. I am not persuaded to deviate from the view which I stated in 1947 in Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46, 90-92 (dissenting opinion):
""Since Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, was decided, the practice has been firmly established, for better or worse, that courts can strike down legislative enactments which violate the Constitution. This process, of course, involves interpretation, and since words can have many meanings, interpretation obviously may result in contraction or extension of the original purpose of a constitutional provision, thereby affecting policy. But to pass upon the constitutionality of statutes by looking to the particular standards enumerated in the Bill of Rights and other parts of the Constitution is one thing; to invalidate statutes because of application of `natural law' deemed to be above and undefined by the Constitution is another. `In the one instance, courts proceeding within clearly marked constitutional boundaries seek to execute policies written into the Constitution; in the other, they roam at will in the limitless *526 area of their own beliefs as to reasonableness and actually select policies, a responsibility which the Constitution entrusts to the legislative representatives of the people.' Federal Power Commission v. Pipeline Co., 315 U.S. 575, 599, 601, n. 4.""[21] (Footnotes omitted.)
The late Judge Learned Hand, after emphasizing his view that judges should not use the due process formula suggested in the concurring opinions today or any other formula like it to invalidate legislation offensive to their ""personal preferences,""[22] made the statement, with which I fully agree, that:
""For myself it would be most irksome to be ruled by a bevy of Platonic Guardians, even if I *527 knew how to choose them, which I assuredly do not.""[23]
So far as I am concerned, Connecticut's law as applied here is not forbidden by any provision of the Federal Constitution as that Constitution was written, and I would therefore affirm.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, whom MR."
29312,Justice Goldberg,concurring,False,Griswold v. Connecticut,,1965,2.0,"I agree with the Court that Connecticut's birth-control law unconstitutionally intrudes upon the right of marital privacy, and I join in its opinion and judgment. Although I have not accepted the view that ""due process"" as used in the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates all of the first eight Amendments (see my concurring opinion in Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 410, and the dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN in Cohen v. Hurley, 366 U.S. 117, 154), I do agree that the concept of liberty protects those personal rights that are fundamental, and is not confined to the specific terms of the Bill of Rights. My conclusion that the concept of liberty is not so restricted and that it embraces the right of marital privacy though that right is not mentioned explicitly in the Constitution[1] is supported both by numerous *487 decisions of this Court, referred to in the Court's opinion, and by the language and history of the Ninth Amendment. In reaching the conclusion that the right of marital privacy is protected, as being within the protected penumbra of specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights, the Court refers to the Ninth Amendment, ante, at 484. I add these words to emphasize the relevance of that Amendment to the Court's holding.
The Court stated many years ago that the Due Process Clause protects those liberties that are ""so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental."" Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 105. In Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652, 666, the Court said:
""For present purposes we may and do assume that freedom of speech and of the presswhich are protected by the First Amendment from abridgment by Congressare among the fundamental personal rights and `liberties' protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by the States."" (Emphasis added.)
*488 And, in Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399, the Court, referring to the Fourteenth Amendment, stated:
""While this Court has not attempted to define with exactness the liberty thus guaranteed, the term has received much consideration and some of the included things have been definitely stated. Without doubt, it denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also [for example,] the right . . . to marry, establish a home and bring up children . . . .""
This Court, in a series of decisions, has held that the Fourteenth Amendment absorbs and applies to the States those specifics of the first eight amendments which express fundamental personal rights.[2] The language and history of the Ninth Amendment reveal that the Framers of the Constitution believed that there are additional fundamental rights, protected from governmental infringement, which exist alongside those fundamental rights specifically mentioned in the first eight constitutional amendments.
The Ninth Amendment reads, ""The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."" The Amendment is almost entirely the work of James Madison. It was introduced in Congress by him and passed the House and Senate with little or no debate and virtually no change in language. It was proffered to quiet expressed fears that a bill of specifically enumerated rights[3] could not be sufficiently broad to cover all essential *489 rights and that the specific mention of certain rights would be interpreted as a denial that others were protected.[4]
In presenting the proposed Amendment, Madison said:
""It has been objected also against a bill of rights, that, by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration; and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government, and were consequently insecure. This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard urged against the admission of a bill of rights into this system; but, I conceive, that it may be guarded against. I have attempted it, as gentlemen may see by turning to the *490 last clause of the fourth resolution [the Ninth Amendment]."" I Annals of Congress 439 (Gales and Seaton ed. 1834).
Mr. Justice Story wrote of this argument against a bill of rights and the meaning of the Ninth Amendment:
""In regard to . . . [a] suggestion, that the affirmance of certain rights might disparage others, or might lead to argumentative implications in favor of other powers, it might be sufficient to say that such a course of reasoning could never be sustained upon any solid basis . . . . But a conclusive answer is, that such an attempt may be interdicted (as it has been) by a positive declaration in such a bill of rights that the enumeration of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."" II Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 626-627 (5th ed. 1891).
He further stated, referring to the Ninth Amendment:
""This clause was manifestly introduced to prevent any perverse or ingenious misapplication of the well-known maxim, that an affirmation in particular cases implies a negation in all others; and, e converso, that a negation in particular cases implies an affirmation in all others."" Id., at 651.
These statements of Madison and Story make clear that the Framers did not intend that the first eight amendments be construed to exhaust the basic and fundamental rights which the Constitution guaranteed to the people.[5]
While this Court has had little occasion to interpret the Ninth Amendment,[6] ""[i]t cannot be presumed that any *491 clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect."" Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 174. In interpreting the Constitution, ""real effect should be given to all the words it uses."" Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 151. The Ninth Amendment to the Constitution may be regarded by some as a recent discovery and may be forgotten by others, but since 1791 it has been a basic part of the Constitution which we are sworn to uphold. To hold that a right so basic and fundamental and so deep-rooted in our society as the right of privacy in marriage may be infringed because that right is not guaranteed in so many words by the first eight amendments to the Constitution is to ignore the Ninth Amendment and to give it no effect whatsoever. Moreover, a judicial construction that this fundamental right is not protected by the Constitution because it is not mentioned in explicit terms by one of the first eight amendments or elsewhere in the Constitution would violate the Ninth Amendment, which specifically states that *492 ""[t]he enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."" (Emphasis added.)
A dissenting opinion suggests that my interpretation of the Ninth Amendment somehow ""broaden[s] the powers of this Court."" Post, at 520. With all due respect, I believe that it misses the import of what I am saying. I do not take the position of my Brother BLACK in his dissent in Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46, 68, that the entire Bill of Rights is incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment, and I do not mean to imply that the Ninth Amendment is applied against the States by the Fourteenth. Nor do I mean to state that the Ninth Amendment constitutes an independent source of rights protected from infringement by either the States or the Federal Government. Rather, the Ninth Amendment shows a belief of the Constitution's authors that fundamental rights exist that are not expressly enumerated in the first eight amendments and an intent that the list of rights included there not be deemed exhaustive. As any student of this Court's opinions knows, this Court has held, often unanimously, that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect certain fundamental personal liberties from abridgment by the Federal Government or the States. See, e. g., Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497; Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U.S. 500; Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116; Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296; NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449; Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335; New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254. The Ninth Amendment simply shows the intent of the Constitution's authors that other fundamental personal rights should not be denied such protection or disparaged in any other way simply because they are not specifically listed in the first eight constitutional amendments. I do not see how this broadens the authority *493 of the Court; rather it serves to support what this Court has been doing in protecting fundamental rights.
Nor am I turning somersaults with history in arguing that the Ninth Amendment is relevant in a case dealing with a State's infringement of a fundamental right. While the Ninth Amendmentand indeed the entire Bill of Rightsoriginally concerned restrictions upon federal power, the subsequently enacted Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the States as well from abridging fundamental personal liberties. And, the Ninth Amendment, in indicating that not all such liberties are specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments, is surely relevant in showing the existence of other fundamental personal rights, now protected from state, as well as federal, infringement. In sum, the Ninth Amendment simply lends strong support to the view that the ""liberty"" protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments from infringement by the Federal Government or the States is not restricted to rights specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments. Cf. United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 94-95.
In determining which rights are fundamental, judges are not left at large to decide cases in light of their personal and private notions. Rather, they must look to the ""traditions and [collective] conscience of our people"" to determine whether a principle is ""so rooted [there] . . . as to be ranked as fundamental."" Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 105. The inquiry is whether a right involved ""is of such a character that it cannot be denied without violating those `fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions' . . . ."" Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 67. ""Liberty"" also ""gains content from the emanations of . . . specific [constitutional] guarantees"" and ""from experience with the requirements of a free society."" Poe *494 v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 517 (dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS).[7]
I agree fully with the Court that, applying these tests, the right of privacy is a fundamental personal right, emanating ""from the totality of the constitutional scheme under which we live."" Id., at 521. Mr. Justice Brandeis, dissenting in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478, comprehensively summarized the principles underlying the Constitution's guarantees of privacy:
""The protection guaranteed by the [Fourth and Fifth] Amendments is much broader in scope. The makers of our Constitution undertook to secure conditions favorable to the pursuit of happiness. They recognized the significance of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and of his intellect. They knew that only a part of the pain, pleasure and satisfactions of life are to be found in material things. They sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions and their sensations. They conferred, as against the Government, the right to be let alone the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men.""
*495 The Connecticut statutes here involved deal with a particularly important and sensitive area of privacythat of the marital relation and the marital home. This Court recognized in Meyer v. Nebraska, supra, that the right ""to marry, establish a home and bring up children"" was an essential part of the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. 262 U.S., at 399. In Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, the Court held unconstitutional an Oregon Act which forbade parents from sending their children to private schools because such an act ""unreasonably interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control."" 268 U.S., at 534-535. As this Court said in Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, at 166, the Meyer and Pierce decisions ""have respected the private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.""
I agree with MR. JUSTICE HARLAN's statement in his dissenting opinion in Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 551-552: ""Certainly the safeguarding of the home does not follow merely from the sanctity of property rights. The home derives its pre-eminence as the seat of family life. And the integrity of that life is something so fundamental that it has been found to draw to its protection the principles of more than one explicitly granted Constitutional right. . . . Of this whole `private realm of family life' it is difficult to imagine what is more private or more intimate than a husband and wife's marital relations.""
The entire fabric of the Constitution and the purposes that clearly underlie its specific guarantees demonstrate that the rights to marital privacy and to marry and raise a family are of similar order and magnitude as the fundamental rights specifically protected.
Although the Constitution does not speak in so many words of the right of privacy in marriage, I cannot believe that it offers these fundamental rights no protection. The fact that no particular provision of the Constitution *496 explicitly forbids the State from disrupting the traditional relation of the familya relation as old and as fundamental as our entire civilizationsurely does not show that the Government was meant to have the power to do so. Rather, as the Ninth Amendment expressly recognizes, there are fundamental personal rights such as this one, which are protected from abridgment by the Government though not specifically mentioned in the Constitution.
My Brother STEWART, while characterizing the Connecticut birth control law as ""an uncommonly silly law,"" post, at 527, would nevertheless let it stand on the ground that it is not for the courts to "" `substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies, who are elected to pass laws.' "" Post, at 528. Elsewhere, I have stated that ""[w]hile I quite agree with Mr. Justice Brandeis that . . . `a . . . State may . . . serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments,' New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 280, 311 (dissenting opinion), I do not believe that this includes the power to experiment with the fundamental liberties of citizens . . . .""[8] The vice of the dissenters' views is that it would permit such experimentation by the States in the area of the fundamental personal rights of its citizens. I cannot agree that the Constitution grants such power either to the States or to the Federal Government.
The logic of the dissents would sanction federal or state legislation that seems to me even more plainly unconstitutional than the statute before us. Surely the Government, absent a showing of a compelling subordinating state interest, could not decree that all husbands and wives must be sterilized after two children have been born *497 to them. Yet by their reasoning such an invasion of marital privacy would not be subject to constitutional challenge because, while it might be ""silly,"" no provision of the Constitution specifically prevents the Government from curtailing the marital right to bear children and raise a family. While it may shock some of my Brethren that the Court today holds that the Constitution protects the right of marital privacy, in my view it is far more shocking to believe that the personal liberty guaranteed by the Constitution does not include protection against such totalitarian limitation of family size, which is at complete variance with our constitutional concepts. Yet, if upon a showing of a slender basis of rationality, a law outlawing voluntary birth control by married persons is valid, then, by the same reasoning, a law requiring compulsory birth control also would seem to be valid. In my view, however, both types of law would unjustifiably intrude upon rights of marital privacy which are constitutionally protected.
In a long series of cases this Court has held that where fundamental personal liberties are involved, they may not be abridged by the States simply on a showing that a regulatory statute has some rational relationship to the effectuation of a proper state purpose. ""Where there is a significant encroachment upon personal liberty, the State may prevail only upon showing a subordinating interest which is compelling,"" Bates v. Little Rock, 361 U.S. 516, 524. The law must be shown ""necessary, and not merely rationally related, to the accomplishment of a permissible state policy."" McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184, 196. See Schneider v. Irvington, 308 U.S. 147, 161.
Although the Connecticut birth-control law obviously encroaches upon a fundamental personal liberty, the State does not show that the law serves any ""subordinating [state] interest which is compelling"" or that it is ""necessary *498. . . to the accomplishment of a permissible state policy."" The State, at most, argues that there is some rational relation between this statute and what is admittedly a legitimate subject of state concernthe discouraging of extra-marital relations. It says that preventing the use of birth-control devices by married persons helps prevent the indulgence by some in such extramarital relations. The rationality of this justification is dubious, particularly in light of the admitted widespread availability to all persons in the State of Connecticut, unmarried as well as married, of birth-control devices for the prevention of disease, as distinguished from the prevention of conception, see Tileston v. Ullman, 129 Conn. 84, 26 A.2d 582. But, in any event, it is clear that the state interest in safeguarding marital fidelity can be served by a more discriminately tailored statute, which does not, like the present one, sweep unnecessarily broadly, reaching far beyond the evil sought to be dealt with and intruding upon the privacy of all married couples. See Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U.S. 500, 514; NAACP v. Alabama, 377 U.S. 288, 307-308; McLaughlin v. Florida, supra, at 196. Here, as elsewhere, where, ""[p]recision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms."" NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 438. The State of Connecticut does have statutes, the constitutionality of which is beyond doubt, which prohibit adultery and fornication. See Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 53-218, 53-219 et seq. These statutes demonstrate that means for achieving the same basic purpose of protecting marital fidelity are available to Connecticut without the need to ""invade the area of protected freedoms."" NAACP v. Alabama, supra, at 307. See McLaughlin v. Florida, supra, at 196.
Finally, it should be said of the Court's holding today that it in no way interferes with a State's proper regulation *499 of sexual promiscuity or misconduct. As my Brother HARLAN so well stated in his dissenting opinion in Poe v. Ullman, supra, at 553.
""Adultery, homosexuality and the like are sexual intimacies which the State forbids . . . but the intimacy of husband and wife is necessarily an essential and accepted feature of the institution of marriage, an institution which the State not only must allow, but which always and in every age it has fostered and protected. It is one thing when the State exerts its power either to forbid extra-marital sexuality . . . or to say who may marry, but it is quite another when, having acknowledged a marriage and the intimacies inherent in it, it undertakes to regulate by means of the criminal law the details of that intimacy.""
In sum, I believe that the right of privacy in the marital relation is fundamental and basica personal right ""retained by the people"" within the meaning of the Ninth Amendment. Connecticut cannot constitutionally abridge this fundamental right, which is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from infringement by the States. I agree with the Court that petitioners' convictions must therefore be reversed.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring in the judgment.
I fully agree with the judgment of reversal, but find myself unable to join the Court's opinion. The reason is that it seems to me to evince an approach to this case very much like that taken by my Brothers BLACK and STEWART in dissent, namely: the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not touch this Connecticut statute unless the enactment is found to violate some right assured by the letter or penumbra of the Bill of Rights.
*500 In other words, what I find implicit in the Court's opinion is that the ""incorporation"" doctrine may be used to restrict the reach of Fourteenth Amendment Due Process. For me this is just as unacceptable constitutional doctrine as is the use of the ""incorporation"" approach to impose upon the States all the requirements of the Bill of Rights as found in the provisions of the first eight amendments and in the decisions of this Court interpreting them. See, e. g., my concurring opinions in Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 408, and Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 615, and my dissenting opinion in Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 522, at pp. 539-545.
In my view, the proper constitutional inquiry in this case is whether this Connecticut statute infringes the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the enactment violates basic values ""implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,"" Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325. For reasons stated at length in my dissenting opinion in Poe v. Ullman, supra, I believe that it does. While the relevant inquiry may be aided by resort to one or more of the provisions of the Bill of Rights, it is not dependent on them or any of their radiations. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment stands, in my opinion, on its own bottom.
A further observation seems in order respecting the justification of my Brothers BLACK and STEWART for their ""incorporation"" approach to this case. Their approach does not rest on historical reasons, which are of course wholly lacking (see Fairman, Does the Fourteenth Amendment Incorporate the Bill of Rights? The Original Understanding, 2 Stan. L. Rev. 5 (1949)), but on the thesis that by limiting the content of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the protection of rights which can be found elsewhere in the Constitution, in this instance in the Bill of Rights, judges will thus be confined to ""interpretation"" of specific constitutional *501 provisions, and will thereby be restrained from introducing their own notions of constitutional right and wrong into the ""vague contours of the Due Process Clause."" Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 170.
While I could not more heartily agree that judicial ""self restraint"" is an indispensable ingredient of sound constitutional adjudication, I do submit that the formula suggested for achieving it is more hollow than real. ""Specific"" provisions of the Constitution, no less than ""due process,"" lend themselves as readily to ""personal"" interpretations by judges whose constitutional outlook is simply to keep the Constitution in supposed ""tune with the times"" (post, p. 522). Need one go further than to recall last Term's reapportionment cases, Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1. and Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, where a majority of the Court ""interpreted"" ""by the People"" (Art. I, § 2) and ""equal protection"" (Amdt. 14) to command ""one person, one vote,"" an interpretation that was made in the face of irrefutable and still unanswered history to the contrary? See my dissenting opinions in those cases, 376 U.S., at 20; 377 U. S., at 589.
Judicial self-restraint will not, I suggest, be brought about in the ""due process"" area by the historically unfounded incorporation formula long advanced by my Brother BLACK, and now in part espoused by my Brother STEWART. It will be achieved in this area, as in other constitutional areas, only by continual insistence upon respect for the teachings of history, solid recognition of the basic values that underlie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles that the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers have played in establishing and preserving American freedoms. See Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46, 59 (Mr. Justice Frankfurter, concurring). Adherence to these principles will not, of course, obviate all constitutional differences of opinion among judges, nor should it. Their continued recognition *502 will, however, go farther toward keeping most judges from roaming at large in the constitutional field than will the interpolation into the Constitution of an artificial and largely illusory restriction on the content of the Due Process Clause.[*]
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, concurring in the judgment.
In my view this Connecticut law as applied to married couples deprives them of ""liberty"" without due process of law, as that concept is used in the Fourteenth Amendment. I therefore concur in the judgment of the Court reversing these convictions under Connecticut's aiding and abetting statute.
It would be unduly repetitious, and belaboring the obvious, to expound on the impact of this statute on the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment against arbitrary or capricious denials or on the nature of this liberty. Suffice it to say that this is not the first time this Court has had occasion to articulate that the liberty entitled to protection under the Fourteenth Amendment includes the right ""to marry, establish a home and bring up children,"" Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399, and ""the liberty . . . to direct the upbringing and education of children,"" Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 534-535, and that these are among ""the basic civil rights of man."" Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541. These decisions affirm that there is a ""realm of family life which the state cannot enter"" without substantial justification. Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166. Surely the right invoked in this case, to be free of regulation of the intimacies of *503 the marriage relationship, ""come[s] to this Court with a momentum for respect lacking when appeal is made to liberties which derive merely from shifting economic arrangements."" Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77, 95 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).
The Connecticut anti-contraceptive statute deals rather substantially with this relationship. For it forbids all married persons the right to use birth-control devices, regardless of whether their use is dictated by considerations of family planning, Trubek v. Ullman, 147 Conn. 633, 165 A.2d 158, health, or indeed even of life itself. Buxton v. Ullman, 147 Conn. 48, 156 A.2d 508. The anti-use statute, together with the general aiding and abetting statute, prohibits doctors from affording advice to married persons on proper and effective methods of birth control. Tileston v. Ullman, 129 Conn. 84, 26 A.2d 582. And the clear effect of these statutes, as enforced, is to deny disadvantaged citizens of Connecticut, those without either adequate knowledge or resources to obtain private counseling, access to medical assistance and up-to-date information in respect to proper methods of birth control. State v. Nelson, 126 Conn. 412, 11 A.2d 856; State v. Griswold, 151 Conn. 544, 200 A.2d 479. In my view, a statute with these effects bears a substantial burden of justification when attacked under the Fourteenth Amendment. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356; Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535; Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U.S. 232; McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184, 192.
An examination of the justification offered, however, cannot be avoided by saying that the Connecticut anti-use statute invades a protected area of privacy and association or that it demeans the marriage relationship. The nature of the right invaded is pertinent, to be sure, for statutes regulating sensitive areas of liberty do, under *504 the cases of this Court, require ""strict scrutiny,"" Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541, and ""must be viewed in the light of less drastic means for achieving the same basic purpose."" Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 488. ""Where there is a significant encroachment upon personal liberty, the State may prevail only upon showing a subordinating interest which is compelling."" Bates v. Little Rock, 361 U.S. 516, 524. See also McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184. But such statutes, if reasonably necessary for the effectuation of a legitimate and substantial state interest, and not arbitrary or capricious in application, are not invalid under the Due Process Clause. Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U.S. 1.[*]
*505 As I read the opinions of the Connecticut courts and the argument of Connecticut in this Court, the State claims but one justification for its anti-use statute. Cf. Allied Stores of Ohio v. Bowers, 358 U.S. 522, 530; Martin v. Walton, 368 U.S. 25, 28 (DOUGLAS, J., dissenting). There is no serious contention that Connecticut thinks the use of artificial or external methods of contraception immoral or unwise in itself, or that the anti-use statute is founded upon any policy of promoting population expansion. Rather, the statute is said to serve the State's policy against all forms of promiscuous or illicit sexual relationships, be they premarital or extramarital, concededly a permissible and legitimate legislative goal.
Without taking issue with the premise that the fear of conception operates as a deterrent to such relationships in addition to the criminal proscriptions Connecticut has against such conduct, I wholly fail to see how the ban on the use of contraceptives by married couples in any way reinforces the State's ban on illicit sexual relationships. See Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U.S. 232, 239. Connecticut does not bar the importation or possession of contraceptive devices; they are not considered contraband material under state law, State v. Certain Contraceptive Materials, 126 Conn. 428, 11 A.2d 863, and their availability in that State is not seriously disputed. The only way Connecticut seeks to limit or control the availability of such devices is through its general aiding and abetting statute whose operation in this context has *506 been quite obviously ineffective and whose most serious use has been against birth-control clinics rendering advice to married, rather than unmarried, persons. Cf. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356. Indeed, after over 80 years of the State's proscription of use, the legality of the sale of such devices to prevent disease has never been expressly passed upon, although it appears that sales have long occurred and have only infrequently been challenged. This ""undeviating policy . . . throughout all the long years . . . bespeaks more than prosecutorial paralysis."" Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 502. Moreover, it would appear that the sale of contraceptives to prevent disease is plainly legal under Connecticut law.
In these circumstances one is rather hard pressed to explain how the ban on use by married persons in any way prevents use of such devices by persons engaging in illicit sexual relations and thereby contributes to the State's policy against such relationships. Neither the state courts nor the State before the bar of this Court has tendered such an explanation. It is purely fanciful to believe that the broad proscription on use facilitates discovery of use by persons engaging in a prohibited relationship or for some other reason makes such use more unlikely and thus can be supported by any sort of administrative consideration. Perhaps the theory is that the flat ban on use prevents married people from possessing contraceptives and without the ready availability of such devices for use in the marital relationship, there will be no or less temptation to use them in extramarital ones. This reasoning rests on the premise that married people will comply with the ban in regard to their marital relationship, notwithstanding total nonenforcement in this context and apparent nonenforcibility, but will not comply with criminal statutes prohibiting extramarital affairs and the anti-use statute in respect to illicit sexual relationships, a premise whose validity has not been *507 demonstrated and whose intrinsic validity is not very evident. At most the broad ban is of marginal utility to the declared objective. A statute limiting its prohibition on use to persons engaging in the prohibited relationship would serve the end posited by Connecticut in the same way, and with the same effectiveness, or ineffectiveness, as the broad anti-use statute under attack in this case. I find nothing in this record justifying the sweeping scope of this statute, with its telling effect on the freedoms of married persons, and therefore conclude that it deprives such persons of liberty without due process of law.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR."
29311,Justice Douglas,majority,False,Griswold v. Connecticut,,1965,2.0,"Appellant Griswold is Executive Director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut. Appellant Buxton is a licensed physician and a professor at the Yale Medical School who served as Medical Director for the League at its Center in New Havena center open and operating from November 1 to November 10, 1961, when appellants were arrested.
They gave information, instruction, and medical advice to married persons as to the means of preventing conception. They examined the wife and prescribed the best contraceptive device or material for her use. Fees were usually charged, although some couples were serviced free.
The statutes whose constitutionality is involved in this appeal are §§ 53-32 and 54-196 of the General Statutes of Connecticut (1958 rev.). The former provides:
""Any person who uses any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception shall be fined not less than fifty dollars or imprisoned not less than sixty days nor more than one year or be both fined and imprisoned.""
Section 54-196 provides:
""Any person who assists, abets, counsels, causes, hires or commands another to commit any offense may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender.""
The appellants were found guilty as accessories and fined $100 each, against the claim that the accessory statute as so applied violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The Appellate Division of the Circuit Court affirmed. The Supreme Court of Errors affirmed that judgment. 151 Conn. 544, 200 A.2d 479. We noted probable jurisdiction. 379 U.S. 926.
*481 We think that appellants have standing to raise the constitutional rights of the married people with whom they had a professional relationship. Tileston v. Ullman, 318 U.S. 44, is different, for there the plaintiff seeking to represent others asked for a declaratory judgment. In that situation we thought that the requirements of standing should be strict, lest the standards of ""case or controversy"" in Article III of the Constitution become blurred. Here those doubts are removed by reason of a criminal conviction for serving married couples in violation of an aiding-and-abetting statute. Certainly the accessory should have standing to assert that the offense which he is charged with assisting is not, or cannot constitutionally be, a crime.
This case is more akin to Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, where an employee was permitted to assert the rights of his employer; to Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, where the owners of private schools were entitled to assert the rights of potential pupils and their parents; and to Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U.S. 249, where a white defendant, party to a racially restrictive covenant, who was being sued for damages by the covenantors because she had conveyed her property to Negroes, was allowed to raise the issue that enforcement of the covenant violated the rights of prospective Negro purchasers to equal protection, although no Negro was a party to the suit. And see Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390; Adler v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 485; NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449; NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415. The rights of husband and wife, pressed here, are likely to be diluted or adversely affected unless those rights are considered in a suit involving those who have this kind of confidential relation to them.
Coming to the merits, we are met with a wide range of questions that implicate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Overtones of some arguments *482 suggest that Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, should be our guide. But we decline that invitation as we did in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379; Olsen v. Nebraska, 313 U.S. 236; Lincoln Union v. Northwestern Co., 335 U.S. 525; Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483; Giboney v. Empire Storage Co., 336 U.S. 490. We do not sit as a super-legislature to determine the wisdom, need, and propriety of laws that touch economic problems, business affairs, or social conditions. This law, however, operates directly on an intimate relation of husband and wife and their physician's role in one aspect of that relation.
The association of people is not mentioned in the Constitution nor in the Bill of Rights. The right to educate a child in a school of the parents' choicewhether public or private or parochialis also not mentioned. Nor is the right to study any particular subject or any foreign language. Yet the First Amendment has been construed to include certain of those rights.
By Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra, the right to educate one's children as one chooses is made applicable to the States by the force of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. By Meyer v. Nebraska, supra, the same dignity is given the right to study the German language in a private school. In other words, the State may not, consistently with the spirit of the First Amendment, contract the spectrum of available knowledge. The right of freedom of speech and press includes not only the right to utter or to print, but the right to distribute, the right to receive, the right to read (Martin v. Struthers, 319 U.S. 141, 143) and freedom of inquiry, freedom of thought, and freedom to teach (see Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183, 195)indeed the freedom of the entire university community. Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 249-250, 261-263; Barenblatt v. United States, 360 U.S. 109, 112; Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 369. Without *483 those peripheral rights the specific rights would be less secure. And so we reaffirm the principle of the Pierce and the Meyer cases.
In NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 462, we protected the ""freedom to associate and privacy in one's associations,"" noting that freedom of association was a peripheral First Amendment right. Disclosure of membership lists of a constitutionally valid association, we held, was invalid ""as entailing the likelihood of a substantial restraint upon the exercise by petitioner's members of their right to freedom of association."" Ibid. In other words, the First Amendment has a penumbra where privacy is protected from governmental intrusion. In like context, we have protected forms of ""association"" that are not political in the customary sense but pertain to the social, legal, and economic benefit of the members. NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 430-431. In Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U.S. 232, we held it not permissible to bar a lawyer from practice, because he had once been a member of the Communist Party. The man's ""association with that Party"" was not shown to be ""anything more than a political faith in a political party"" (id., at 244) and was not action of a kind proving bad moral character. Id., at 245-246.
Those cases involved more than the ""right of assembly"" a right that extends to all irrespective of their race or ideology. De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353. The right of ""association,"" like the right of belief (Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624), is more than the right to attend a meeting; it includes the right to express one's attitudes or philosophies by membership in a group or by affiliation with it or by other lawful means. Association in that context is a form of expression of opinion; and while it is not expressly included in the First Amendment its existence is necessary in making the express guarantees fully meaningful.
*484 The foregoing cases suggest that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance. See Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 516-522 (dissenting opinion). Various guarantees create zones of privacy. The right of association contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one, as we have seen. The Third Amendment in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers ""in any house"" in time of peace without the consent of the owner is another facet of that privacy. The Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the ""right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures."" The Fifth Amendment in its Self-Incrimination Clause enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which government may not force him to surrender to his detriment. The Ninth Amendment provides: ""The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.""
The Fourth and Fifth Amendments were described in Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 630, as protection against all governmental invasions ""of the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life.""[*] We recently referred *485 in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 656, to the Fourth Amendment as creating a ""right to privacy, no less important than any other right carefully and particularly reserved to the people."" See Beaney, The Constitutional Right to Privacy, 1962 Sup. Ct. Rev. 212; Griswold, The Right to be Let Alone, 55 Nw. U. L. Rev. 216 (1960).
We have had many controversies over these penumbral rights of ""privacy and repose."" See, e. g., Breard v. Alexandria, 341 U.S. 622, 626, 644; Public Utilities Comm'n v. Pollak, 343 U.S. 451; Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167; Lanza v. New York, 370 U.S. 139; Frank v. Maryland, 359 U.S. 360; Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541. These cases bear witness that the right of privacy which presses for recognition here is a legitimate one.
The present case, then, concerns a relationship lying within the zone of privacy created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees. And it concerns a law which, in forbidding the use of contraceptives rather than regulating their manufacture or sale, seeks to achieve its goals by means having a maximum destructive impact upon that relationship. Such a law cannot stand in light of the familiar principle, so often applied by this Court, that a ""governmental purpose to control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to state regulation may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms."" NAACP v. Alabama, 377 U.S. 288, 307. Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives? The *486 very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship.
We deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rightsolder than our political parties, older than our school system. Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions.

MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR."
3935,Justice Black,majority,False,United States v. Vuitch,,1971,1.0,"[*]
Appellee Milan Vuitch, a licensed physician, was indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for producing and attempting to produce abortions in violation of D. C. Code Ann. § 22-201 (1967). Before trial, the district judge granted Vuitch's motion to dismiss the indictments on the ground that the District of Columbia abortion law was unconstitutionally vague. 305 F. Supp. 1032 (DC 1969). The United States appealed *64 to this Court under the Criminal Appeals Act, 18 U.S. C. § 3731. We postponed decision on jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits, 397 U.S. 1061, and requested the parties to brief and argue specified questions on that issue. 399 U.S. 923. We hold that we have jurisdiction and that the statute is not unconstitutionally vague. We reverse.

I
The first question is whether we have jurisdiction under the Criminal Appeals Act to entertain this direct appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. That Act[1] gives us jurisdiction over direct appeals from district court judgments ""in all criminal cases . . . dismissing any indictment . . . where such decision . . . is based upon the invalidity . . . of the statute upon which the indictment . . . is founded."" 18 U.S. C. § 3731. The decision appealed from is a dismissal of indictments on the ground that the District of Columbia abortion law, on which the indictments were based, is unconstitutionally vague. This abortion statute, D. C. Code Ann. § 22-201, is an Act of Congress applicable only in the District of Columbia and we suggested that the parties argue whether a decision holding unconstitutional such a statute is appealable directly to this Court under the Criminal Appeals Act. The literal wording of the Act plainly includes this statute, even though it applies only to the District. A piece of legislation so limited is nevertheless a ""statute"" in the sense *65 that it was duly enacted into law by both Houses of Congress and was signed by the President. And the Criminal Appeals Act contains no language that purports to limit or qualify the term ""statute."" On the contrary, the Act authorizes Government appeals from district courts to the Supreme Court in ""all criminal cases"" where a district court judgment dismissing an indictment is based upon the invalidity of the statute on which the indictment is founded.
An examination of the legislative history of the Criminal Appeals Act and its amendments suggests no reason why we should depart from the Act's literal meaning and exclude District of Columbia (hereafter sometimes D. C.) statutes from its coverage. The committee reports and floor debates contain no discussion indicating that the term ""statute"" does not include statutes applicable only to the District of Columbia.[2] We therefore conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act.
Our Brother HARLAN has argued in dissent that we do not have jurisdiction over this direct appeal. He suggests that such a result is supported by the decision in United States v. Burroughs, 289 U.S. 159 (1933), the policy underlying the Criminal Appeals Act, and the canon of construction that statutes governing direct appeals to this Court should be strictly construed.
It is difficult to see how the Burroughs decision lends much force to his argument, since that case held only that the term ""district court"" in the Criminal Appeals Act did not include the then-existing Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Id., at 163-164. The dissent goes on to suggest the Act should be construed in light of the *66 congressional purpose of avoiding ""inconsistent enforcement of criminal laws."" Post, at 92. This purpose would not be served by our refusing to decide this case now after it has been orally argued. In the last several years, abortion laws have been repeatedly attacked as unconstitutionally vague in both state and federal courts with widely varying results. A number of these cases are now pending on our docket. A refusal to accept jurisdiction here would only compound confusion for doctors, their patients, and law enforcement officials. As this case makes abundantly clear, a ruling on the validity of a statute applicable only to the District can contribute to great disparities and confusion in the enforcement of criminal laws. Finally, my Brother HARLAN'S dissent also appears to rely on the fact that this Court has never accepted jurisdiction over a direct appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act involving the validity of a District of Columbia statute. Post, at 93. Since this Court has never either accepted or rejected jurisdiction of such an appeal, it is difficult to see how the complete absence of precedent in this Court lends any weight whatever to his argument. Neither previous cases nor the purpose behind the Criminal Appeals Act provides any satisfactory reason why the term ""statute"" should not include those statutes applicable only in the District of Columbia.
One other procedural problem remains. We asked the parties to brief the question whether the Government could have appealed this case to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit under D. C. Code Ann. § 23-105 (Supp. 1970), and, if so, whether we should refuse to entertain the appeal here as a matter of sound judicial administration. That D. C. Code provision states:
""In all criminal prosecutions the United States . . . shall have the same right of appeal that is given to the defendant . . . .""
*67 The relationship between the Criminal Appeals Act and this Code section was considered in Carroll v. United States, 354 U.S. 394, 411 (1957), where the Court concluded:
""[C]riminal appeals by the Government in the District of Columbia are not limited to the categories set forth in 18 U.S. C. § 3731 [the Criminal Appeals Act], although as to cases of the type covered by that special jurisdictional statute, its explicit directions will prevail over the general terms of [D. C. Code Ann. § 23-105 (Supp. 1970)].""
Since we have concluded above that this appeal is covered by the Criminal Appeals Act, it would seem to follow from Carroll that the Act's provisions control and no appeal could have been taken to the Court of Appeals. Although Carroll seems to be dispositive, it has been suggested that it may now be limited by United States v. Sweet, 399 U.S. 517 (1970), which contains some language suggesting that the Government may be empowered to take an appeal to the Court of Appeals under § 23-105 even when a direct appeal would be proper here under the Criminal Appeals Act. Id., at 518. We do not elaborate upon that suggestion. We only hold that once an appeal is properly here under the Criminal Appeals Act, we should not refuse to consider it because it might have been taken to another court.

II
We turn now to the merits. Appellee Milan Vuitch was indicted for producing and attempting to produce abortions in violation of D. C. Code Ann. § 22-201. That Act provides in part:
""Whoever, by means of any instrument, medicine, drug or other means whatever, procures or produces, or attempts to procure or produce an abortion or *68 miscarriage on any woman, unless the same were done as necessary for the preservation of the mother's life or health and under the direction of a competent licensed practitioner of medicine, shall be imprisoned in the penitentiary not less than one year or not more than ten years . . . .""
Without waiting for trial, the District Judge dismissed the indictments on the ground that the abortion statute was unconstitutionally vague. In his view, set out substantially in full below,[3] the statute was vague for two principal reasons:
1. The fact that once an abortion was proved a physician ""is presumed guilty and remains so unless a jury *69 can be persuaded that his acts were necessary for the preservation of the woman's life or health.""
2. The presence of the ""ambivalent and uncertain word `health.' ""
In concluding that the statute places the burden of persuasion on the defendant once the fact of an abortion has been proved,[4] the court relied on Williams v. United States, 78 U. S. App. D. C. 147, 138 F.2d 81 (1943). There the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the prosecution was not required to prove as part of its case in chief that the operation was not necessary to preserve life or health. Id., at 147, 149, 138 F.2d, at 81, 83. The court indicated that once the prosecution established that an abortion had been performed the defendant was required ""to come forward with evidence which with or without other evidence is sufficient to create a reasonable doubt of guilt."" Id., at 150, 138 F.2d, at 84. The District Court here appears to have read Williams as holding that once an abortion is proved, the burden of persuading the jury that it was legal (i. e., necessary to the preservation of the mother's life or health) is cast upon the physician. Whether or not this is a correct reading of Williams, we *70 believe it is an erroneous interpretation of the statute. Certainly a statute that outlawed only a limited category of abortions but ""presumed"" guilt whenever the mere fact of abortion was established, would at the very least present serious constitutional problems under this Court's previous decisions interpreting the Fifth Amendment. Tot v. United States, 319 U.S. 463 (1943); Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 36 (1969). But of course statutes should be construed whenever possible so as to uphold their constitutionality.
The statute does not outlaw all abortions, but only those which are not performed under the direction of a competent, licensed physician, and those not necessary to preserve the mother's life or health. It is a general guide to the interpretation of criminal statutes that when an exception is incorporated in the enacting clause of a statute, the burden is on the prosecution to plead and prove that the defendant is not within the exception. When Congress passed the District of Columbia abortion law in 1901 and amended it in 1953, it expressly authorized physicians to perform such abortions as are necessary to preserve the mother's ""life or health."" Because abortions were authorized only in more restrictive circumstances under previous D. C. law, the change must represent a judgment by Congress that it is desirable that women be able to obtain abortions needed for the preservation of their lives or health.[5] It would be highly anomalous for a legislature to authorize abortions necessary for life or health and then to demand that a doctor, upon pain of one to ten years' imprisonment, bear the burden of proving that an abortion he performed fell within that category. Placing such a burden of proof *71 on a doctor would be peculiarly inconsistent with society's notions of the responsibilities of the medical profession. Generally, doctors are encouraged by society's expectations, by the strictures of malpractice law and by their own professional standards to give their patients such treatment as is necessary to preserve their health. We are unable to believe that Congress intended that a physician be required to prove his innocence. We therefore hold that under D. C. Code Ann. § 22-201, the burden is on the prosecution to plead and prove that an abortion was not ""necessary for the preservation of the mother's life or health.""
There remains the contention that the word ""health"" is so imprecise and has so uncertain a meaning that it fails to inform a defendant of the charge against him and therefore the statute offends the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. See, e. g., Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451 (1939). We hold that it does not. The trial court apparently felt that the term was vague because there ""is no indication whether it includes varying degrees of mental as well as physical health."" 305 F. Supp., at 1034. It is true that the legislative history of the statute gives no guidance as to whether ""health"" refers to both a patient's mental and physical state. The term ""health"" was introduced into the law in 1901 when the statute was enacted in substantially its present form. The House Report[6] on the bill contains no discussion of the term ""health"" and there was no Senate report. Nor have we found any District of Columbia cases prior to this District Court decision that shed any light on the question. Since that decision, however, the issue has been considered in Doe v. General Hospital of the District of Columbia, 313 F. Supp. 1170 (DC 1970). There District Judge Waddy construed the statute to *72 permit abortions ""for mental health reasons whether or not the patient had a previous history of mental defects."" Id., at 1174-1175. The same construction was followed by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in further proceedings in the same case. 140 U. S. App. D. C. 149 and 153, 434 F.2d 423 and 427 (1970). We see no reason why this interpretation of the statute should not be followed. Certainly this construction accords with the general usage and modern understanding of the word ""health,"" which includes psychological as well as physical well-being. Indeed Webster's Dictionary, in accord with that common usage, properly defines health as the ""[s]tate of being. . . sound in body [or] mind."" Viewed in this light, the term ""health"" presents no problem of vagueness. Indeed, whether a particular operation is necessary for a patient's physical or mental health is a judgment that physicians are obviously called upon to make routinely whenever surgery is considered.[7]
We therefore hold that properly construed the District of Columbia abortion law is not unconstitutionally vague, and that the trial court erred in dismissing the indictments on that ground. Appellee has suggested that there are other reasons why the dismissal of the indictments should be affirmed. Essentially, these arguments *73 are based on this Court's decision in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965). Although there was some reference to these arguments in the opinion of the court below, we read it as holding simply that the statute was void for vagueness because it failed in that court's language to ""give that certainty which due process of law considers essential in a criminal statute."" 305 F. Supp., at 1034. Since that question of vagueness was the only issue passed upon by the District Court it is the only issue we reach here. United States v. Borden Co., 308 U.S. 188 (1939); United States v. Petrillo, 332 U.S. 1 (1947); United States v. Blue, 384 U.S. 251, 256 (1966).
The judgment is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

MR."
20525,Justice Burger,majority,False,Reed v. Reed,,1971,2.0,"Richard Lynn Reed, a minor, died intestate in Ada County, Idaho, on March 29, 1967. His adoptive parents, who had separated sometime prior to his death, are the parties to this appeal. Approximately seven months after Richard's death, his mother, appellant Sally Reed, filed a petition in the Probate Court of Ada County, *72 seeking appointment as administratrix of her son's estate.[1] Prior to the date set for a hearing on the mother's petition, appellee Cecil Reed, the father of the decedent, filed a competing petition seeking to have himself appointed administrator of the son's estate. The probate court held a joint hearing on the two petitions and thereafter ordered that letters of administration be issued to appellee Cecil Reed upon his taking the oath and filing the bond required by law. The court treated §§ 15-312 and 15-314 of the Idaho Code as the controlling statutes and read those sections as compelling a preference for Cecil Reed because he was a male.
Section 15-312[2] designates the persons who are entitled to administer the estate of one who dies intestate. In making these designations, that section lists 11 classes of persons who are so entitled and provides, in substance, *73 that the order in which those classes are listed in the section shall be determinative of the relative rights of competing applicants for letters of administration. One of the 11 classes so enumerated is ""[t]he father or mother"" of the person dying intestate. Under this section, then, appellant and appellee, being members of the same entitlement class, would seem to have been equally entitled to administer their son's estate. Section 15-314 provides, however, that
""[o]f several persons claiming and equally entitled [under § 15-312] to administer, males must be preferred to females, and relatives of the whole to those of the half blood.""
In issuing its order, the probate court implicitly recognized the equality of entitlement of the two applicants under § 15-312 and noted that neither of the applicants was under any legal disability; the court ruled, however, that appellee, being a male, was to be preferred to the female appellant ""by reason of Section 15-314 of the Idaho Code."" In stating this conclusion, the probate judge gave no indication that he had attempted to determine the relative capabilities of the competing applicants to perform the functions incident to the administration of an estate. It seems clear the probate judge considered himself bound by statute to give preference to the male candidate over the female, each being otherwise ""equally entitled.""
Sally Reed appealed from the probate court order, and her appeal was treated by the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of Idaho as a constitutional attack on § 15-314. In dealing with the attack, that court held that the challenged section violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment[3] and was, therefore, *74 void; the matter was ordered ""returned to the Probate Court for its determination of which of the two parties"" was better qualified to administer the estate.
This order was never carried out, however, for Cecil Reed took a further appeal to the Idaho Supreme Court, which reversed the District Court and reinstated the original order naming the father administrator of the estate. In reaching this result, the Idaho Supreme Court first dealt with the governing statutory law and held that under § 15-312 ""a father and mother are `equally entitled' to letters of administration,"" but the preference given to males by § 15-314 is ""mandatory"" and leaves no room for the exercise of a probate court's discretion in the appointment of administrators. Having thus definitively and authoritatively interpreted the statutory provisions involved, the Idaho Supreme Court then proceeded to examine, and reject, Sally Reed's contention that § 15-314 violates the Equal Protection Clause by giving a mandatory preference to males over females, without regard to their individual qualifications as potential estate administrators. 93 Idaho 511, 465 P.2d 635.
Sally Reed thereupon appealed for review by this Court pursuant to 28 U.S. C. § 1257 (2), and we noted probable jurisdiction. 401 U.S. 934. Having examined the record and considered the briefs and oral arguments of the parties, we have concluded that the arbitrary preference established in favor of males by § 15-314 of the Idaho Code cannot stand in the face of the Fourteenth Amendment's command that no State deny the equal protection of the laws to any person within its jurisdiction.[4]
*75 Idaho does not, of course, deny letters of administration to women altogether. Indeed, under § 15-312, a woman whose spouse dies intestate has a preference over a son, father, brother, or any other male relative of the decedent. Moreover, we can judicially notice that in this country, presumably due to the greater longevity of women, a large proportion of estates, both intestate and under wills of decedents, are administered by surviving widows.
Section 15-314 is restricted in its operation to those situations where competing applications for letters of administration have been filed by both male and female members of the same entitlement class established by § 15-312. In such situations, § 15-314 provides that different treatment be accorded to the applicants on the basis of their sex; it thus establishes a classification subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.
In applying that clause, this Court has consistently recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment does not deny to States the power to treat different classes of persons in different ways. Barbier v. Connolly, 113 U.S. 27 (1885); Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220 U.S. 61 (1911); Railway Express Agency v. New York, 336 U.S. 106 (1949); McDonald v. Board of Election Commissioners, 394 U.S. 802 (1969). The Equal Protection Clause of that amendment does, however, deny to States the power to legislate that different treatment be accorded to persons placed by a statute into *76 different classes on the basis of criteria wholly unrelated to the objective of that statute. A classification ""must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike."" Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U.S. 412, 415 (1920). The question presented by this case, then, is whether a difference in the sex of competing applicants for letters of administration bears a rational relationship to a state objective that is sought to be advanced by the operation of §§ 15-312 and 15-314.
In upholding the latter section, the Idaho Supreme Court concluded that its objective was to eliminate one area of controversy when two or more persons, equally entitled under § 15-312, seek letters of administration and thereby present the probate court ""with the issue of which one should be named."" The court also concluded that where such persons are not of the same sex, the elimination of females from consideration ""is neither an illogical nor arbitrary method devised by the legislature to resolve an issue that would otherwise require a hearing as to the relative merits . . . of the two or more petitioning relatives . . . ."" 93 Idaho, at 514, 465 P. 2d, at 638.
Clearly the objective of reducing the workload on probate courts by eliminating one class of contests is not without some legitimacy. The crucial question, however, is whether § 15-314 advances that objective in a manner consistent with the command of the Equal Protection Clause. We hold that it does not. To give a mandatory preference to members of either sex over members of the other, merely to accomplish the elimination of hearings on the merits, is to make the very kind of arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and whatever may be *77 said as to the positive values of avoiding intrafamily controversy, the choice in this context may not lawfully be mandated solely on the basis of sex.
We note finally that if § 15-314 is viewed merely as a modifying appendage to § 15-312 and as aimed at the same objective, its constitutionality is not thereby saved. The objective of § 15-312 clearly is to establish degrees of entitlement of various classes of persons in accordance with their varying degrees and kinds of relationship to the intestate. Regardless of their sex, persons within any one of the enumerated classes of that section are similarly situated with respect to that objective. By providing dissimilar treatment for men and women who are thus similarly situated, the challenged section violates the Equal Protection Clause. Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, supra.
The judgment of the Idaho Supreme Court is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed and remanded.
"
3936,Justice White,concurring,False,United States v. Vuitch,,1971,1.0,"I join the Court's opinion and judgment. As to the facial vagueness argument, I have these few additional words. This case comes to us unilluminated by facts or record. The District Court's holding that the District of Columbia statute is unconstitutionally vague on its face because it proscribes all abortions except those necessary for the preservation of the mother's life or health was a judgment that the average person could not understand which abortions were permitted and which were prohibited. But surely the statute puts everyone on adequate notice that the health of the mother, whatever that phrase means, is the governing standard. It should also be absolutely clear that a doctor is not free to perform an abortion on request without considering whether the patient's health requires it. No one of average intelligence could believe that under this statute abortions not dictated by health considerations are legal. *74 Thus even if the ""health"" standard were unconstitutionally vague, which I agree is not the case, the statute is not void on its face since it reaches a class of cases in which the meaning of ""health"" is irrelevant and no possible vagueness problem could arise. We do not, of course, know whether this is one of those cases. Until we do facial vagueness claims must fail. Cf. United States v. National Dairy Corp., 372 U.S. 29 (1963).
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting in part.
While I agree with Part I of the Court's opinion that we have jurisdiction over this appeal, I do not think the statute meets the requirements of procedural due process.
The District of Columbia Code makes it a felony for a physician to perform an abortion ""unless the same were done as necessary for the preservation of the mother's life or health."" D. C. Code Ann. § 22-201 (1967).
I agree with the Court that a physicianwithin the limits of his own expertisewould be able to say that an abortion at a particular time performed on a designated patient would or would not be necessary for the ""preservation"" of her ""life or health."" That judgment, however, is highly subjective, dependent on the training and insight of the particular physician and his standard as to what is ""necessary"" for the ""preservation"" of the mother's ""life or health.""
The answers may well differ, physician to physician. Those trained in conventional obstetrics may have one answer; those with deeper psychiatric insight may have another. Each answer is clear to the particular physician. If we could read the Act as making that determination conclusive, not subject to review by judge and by jury, the case would be simple, as MR. JUSTICE STEWART points out. But that does such violence to the statutory scheme that I believe it is beyond the range of judicial *75 interpretation so to read the Act. If it is to be revised in that manner, Congress should do it.
Hence I read the Act, as did the District Court, as requiring submission to court and jury of the physician's decision. What will the jury say? The prejudices of jurors are customarily taken care of by challenges for cause and by peremptory challenges. But vagueness of criminal statutes introduces another element that is uncontrollable. Are the concepts so vague that possible offenders have no safe guidelines for their own action? Are the concepts so vague that jurors can give them a gloss and meaning drawn from their own predilections and prejudices? Is the statutory standard so easy to manipulate that although physicians can make good-faith decisions based on the standard, juries can nonetheless make felons out of them?
The Court said in Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 453, that a ""statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process.""
A three-judge court in evaluating a Texas statutory standard as to whether an abortion was attempted ""for the purpose of saving the life of the mother"" said:
""How likely must death be? Must death be certain if the abortion is not performed? Is it enough that the woman could not undergo birth without an ascertainably higher possibility of death than would normally be the case? What if the woman threatened suicide if the abortion was not performed? How imminent must death be if the abortion is not performed? Is it sufficient if having the child will shorten the life of the woman by a number of years?"" Roe v. Wade, 314 F. Supp. 1217, 1223.
*76 The Roe case was followed by a three-judge court in Doe v. Scott, 321 F. Supp. 1385, which struck down an Illinois statute which sanctioned an abortion ""necessary for the preservation of the woman's life."" And see People v. Belous, 71 Cal. 2d 954, 458 P.2d 194.
A doctor may well remove an appendix far in advance of rupture in order to prevent a risk that may never materialize. May he act in a similar way under this abortion statute?
May he perform abortions on unmarried women who want to avoid the ""stigma"" of having an illegitimate child? Is bearing a ""stigma"" a ""health"" factor? Only in isolated cases? Or is it such whenever the woman is unmarried?
Is any unwanted pregnancy a ""health"" factor because it is a source of anxiety?
Is an abortion ""necessary"" in the statutory sense if the doctor thought that an additional child in a family would unduly tax the mother's physical well-being by reason of the additional work which would be forced upon her?
Would a doctor be violating the law if he performed an abortion because the added expense of another child in the family would drain its resources, leaving an anxious mother with an insufficient budget to buy nutritious food?
Is the fate of an unwanted child or the plight of the family into which it is born relevant to the factor of the mother's ""health""?
Mr. Justice Holmes, in holding that ""unreasonable"" restraint of trade was an adequate constitutional standard of criminality, said in Nash v. United States, 229 U.S. 373, 377, that ""the law is full of instances where a man's fate depends on his estimating rightly, that is, as the jury subsequently estimates it, some matter of degree. If his judgment is wrong, not only may he *77 incur a fine or a short imprisonment, as here; he may incur the penalty of death.""
He wrote in a context of economic regulations which are restrained by few, if any, constitutional guarantees.
Where, however, constitutional guarantees are implicated, the standards of certainty are more exacting.
Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, 514, 519, held void for vagueness a state statute which as construed made it a crime to print stories of crime ""so massed as to incite to crime,"" since such a regulatory scheme trenched on First Amendment rights of the press.
The standard of ""sacrilegious"" can be used in such an accordion-like way as to infringe on religious rights protected by the First Amendment. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U.S. 495, 505.
The requirement of a ""narrowly drawn"" statute when the regulation touches a protected constitutional right (Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 311; Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88, 100) is only another facet of the void-for-vagueness problem.
What the Court held in Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U.S. 242, is extremely relevant here. The ban of publications made to incite insurrection was held to suffer the vice of vagueness:
""The statute, as construed and applied in the appellant's trial, does not furnish a sufficiently ascertainable standard of guilt.
.....
""Every person who attacks existing conditions, who agitates for a change in the form of government, must take the risk that if a jury should be of opinion he ought to have foreseen that his utterances might contribute in any measure to some future forcible resistance to the existing government he may be convicted of the offense of inciting insurrection. . . . The law, as thus construed, licenses the jury to create *78 its own standard in each case."" Id., at 261, 262, 263. (Italics added.)
If these requirements of certainty are not imposed then the triers of fact have ""a power to invade imperceptibly (and thus unreviewably) a realm of constitutionally protected personal liberties."" Note, The Void-For-Vagueness Doctrine in the Supreme Court, 109 U. Pa. L. Rev. 67, 104 (1960).
Abortion touches intimate affairs of the family, of marriage, of sex, which in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, we held to involve rights associated with several express constitutional rights and which are summed up in ""the right of privacy."" They include the right to procreate (Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535), the right to marry across the color line (Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1), the intimate familial relations between children and parents (Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390; Levy v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 68, 71-72). There is a compelling personal interest in marital privacy and in the limitation of family size. And on the other side is the belief of many that the fetus' once formed, is a member of the human family and that mere personal inconvenience cannot justify the fetus' destruction. This is not to say that government is powerless to legislate on abortions. Yet the laws enacted must not trench on constitutional guarantees which they can easily do unless closely confined.
Abortion statutes deal with conduct which is heavily weighted with religious teachings and ethical concepts.[1]*79 Mr. Justice Jackson once spoke of the ""treacherous grounds we tread when we undertake to translate ethical concepts into legal ones, case by case."" Jordan v. De George, 341 U.S. 223, 242 (dissenting opinion). The difficulty and danger are compounded when religion adds another layer of prejudice.[2] The end result is that juries condemn what they personally disapprove.
The subject of abortionslike cases involving obscenity[3] is one of the most inflammatory ones to reach *80 the Court. People instantly take sides and the public, from whom juries are drawn, makes up its mind one way or the other before the case is even argued. The interests of the mother and the fetus are opposed. On which side should the State throw its weight? The issue is volatile; and it is resolved by the moral code which an individual has. That means that jurors may give it such meaning as they choose, while physicians are left to operate outside the law. Unless the statutory code of conduct is stable and in very narrow bounds, juries have a wide range and physicians have no reliable guide-posts. The words ""necessary for the preservation of the mother's life or health"" become free-wheeling concepts, too easily taking on meaning from the juror's predilections or religious prejudices.
I would affirm the dismissal of these indictments and leave to the experts the drafting of abortion laws[4] that protect good-faith medical practitioners from the treacheries of the present law.
*81 MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN join, dissenting as to jurisdiction.
Appellee Vuitch was indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for violations of D. C. Code Ann. § 22-201 (1967), the District of Columbia abortion statute. This statute is applicable only within the District of Columbia. On pretrial motion by Vuitch, the indictments were dismissed on the ground that the abortion statute was unconstitutionally vague. The United States appealed directly to this Court under the terms of the Criminal Appeals Act of 1907, 18 U.S. C. § 3731, relying on the provision allowing direct appeal ""[f]rom a decision or judgment setting aside, or dismissing any indictment or information, or any count thereof, where such decision or judgment is based upon the invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment or information is founded.""[1] It is not contested *82 that, but for this provision of the Criminal Appeals Act, the Government would have a right of appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit under D. C. Code Ann. § 23-105 (Supp. 1970), which provides:
""In all criminal prosecutions the United States or the District of Columbia, as the case may be, shall have the same right of appeal that is given to the defendant, including the right to a bill of exceptions: Provided, That if on such appeal it shall be found *83 that there was error in the rulings of the court during a trial, a verdict in favor of the defendant shall not be set aside.""
The Court todayrelying on the generic reference to ""statutes"" and ""all criminal cases"" in the text of 18 U.S. C. § 3731 and the absence of an express exclusion of statutes applicable only within the District of Columbia concludes that 18 U.S. C. § 3731 rather than D. C. Code Ann. § 23-105 provides the proper appellate route for this case. I must disagree.

I
The historical development of the Government's right to appeal in criminal cases both in the District of Columbia and throughout the Nation is surveyed in Carroll v. United States, 354 U.S. 394 (1957). Section 23-105 of the D. C. Code was passed in 1901 as § 935 of the Code of 1901. 31 Stat. 1341. Prior to the Criminal Appeals Act of 1907, the Government had no right of appeal in criminal cases outside of the District of Columbia. To remedy this situation, a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives. That bill practically tracked the language of the D. C. statute, and made no provision for direct appeal to this Court. 40 Cong. Rec. 5408. The accompanying House Report described the bill as follows: ""The accompanying bill will extend [§ 935] of the code of the District of Columbia to all districts in the United States."" H. R. Rep. No. 2119, 59th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1906). That bill passed the House, but the Senate Committee on the Judiciary rejected the House approach of simply extending the provisions of the D. C. appeals statute to the rest of the Nation; the Senate Committee instead substituted a more narrowly drawn measure which enumerated specific substantive categories of criminal *84 cases to be appealable by the Government and allocated jurisdiction over these appeals between the Supreme Court and the then Circuit Courts of Appeals according to the allocation of appellate jurisdiction for civil cases established in the Circuit Court of Appeals Act of 1891. S. Rep. No. 3922, 59th Cong., 1st Sess. (1906). See Carroll v. United States, supra, at 402 n. 11. Even that bill as narrowed could not pass the Senate; it provoked extended debate in which the opponents of the measure focused on the potential for abuse of individual rights arising from repeated court proceedings, delays in appeals, and restraints on personal freedom while the Government prosecuted its appeal. See generally United States v. Sisson, 399 U.S. 267 (1970). The upshot of these debates was that Senator Nelson, the bill's floor manager in the Senate, agreed to accept a variety of amendments which further narrowed the categories of cases appealable by the Government and made special provision for the defendant's release on his own recognizance. See 41 Cong. Rec. 2818-2825.[2]
It is at this point that Senator Clarke of Arkansas offered an amendment limiting the Government's right to appeal decisions dismissing indictments or arresting judgments for insufficiency of the indictment to instances where the decision was based upon ""the invalidity or construction of the statute."" The purpose of that amendment was described by Senator Clarke as follows:
""Mr. President, the object of the amendment is to limit the right of appeal upon the part of the General Government to the validity or constitutionality of the statute in which the prosecution is proceeding. It has been enlarged by the addition of another clause, which gives the right of appeal where the *85 construction by the trial court is such as to decide that there is no offense committed, notwithstanding the validity of the statute, and in other respects the proceeding may remain intact. I think that is a broad enough right to concede to the General Government in the prosecution of persons in the court.
.....
""In view of the defects that recent years have disclosed, I do not believe it to be sound policy to go beyond the necessities as they have developed defects in our procedure. A case recently occurring has drawn attention to the fact that if a circuit judge or a district judge holding the circuit should determine that a statute of Congress was invalid, the United States is without means of having that matter submitted to a tribunal that under the Constitution has power to settle that question. I do not believe the remedy ought to be any wider than the mischief that has been disclosed. I do not believe that any additional advantages ought to be given to the General Government in the prosecution of persons arraigned in court, but I do believe the paragraph ought to be perfected in that behalf, so as to provide that there shall be an appeal to the court having authority to give uniformity to the practice which shall prevail in all the courts of the United States, and that they shall be ready to say, and say promptly, what the statute means and whether or not it is a valid statute.
.....
""So I think this amendment gives expression to the proposition that the remedy we provide here now should be no wider than the defect that has been disclosed in the preceding criminal procedure; and that is that whenever the validity of a statute has been adversely decided by a trial court, wherever its *86 unconstitutionality has been pronounced by a trial court, the Government ought to have the right to promptly submit that to the tribunal having authority to dispose of such questions in order that there may be a uniform enforcement of the law throughout the entire limits of the United States.
""This is the purpose I have, Mr. President, and having discussed it with the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin . . . and the distinguished Senator from Minnesota [Mr. NELSON], we agreed that that would probably meet the defect."" 41 Cong. Rec. 2819-2820.
See generally 41 Cong. Rec. 2819-2822.
The bill as thus amended passed the Senate; the House disagreed to the Senate amendment, but yielded in conference. The bill in conference was amended to provide for direct appeals to the Supreme Court. See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 8113, 59th Cong., 2d Sess. (1907). No explanation was given in the conference report for the exclusive direct appeal route.
I draw from these legislative materials the following relevant propositions: (1) The Congress was definitely advertent to the existence of a Governmental appeal right in criminal cases within the District; (2) the Congress explicitly rejected the simple approach of extending the D. C. provision to the Nation; (3) the particular provision of the Act relied on by the Government as supporting its direct appeal in this case was amended with a view to limiting its reach to a relatively precise defect, i. e., the debilitating effect on the enforcement of criminal laws arising from conflicting judicial interpretations; and (4) the substitution of an exclusive direct appeal to this Court, while not expressly explained, is perfectly compatible with the goal of promptly achieving uniformity in construction of statutes applicable nationwide, while at the same time being wholly unnecessary to the resolution *87 of conflicting district court constructions of local D. C. statutes, given the existence of a right of appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

II
The question of overlap between the appellate routes available to the Government in criminal cases under the D. C. Code and 18 U.S. C. § 3731 was first dealt with by this Court in United States v. Burroughs, 289 U.S. 159 (1933). In Burroughs the defendants were indicted in the then Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for violation of the Federal Corrupt Practices Act, a statute of nationwide applicability. They successfully demurred on two grounds: one involving the construction of the statute, and the other involving the sufficiency of the indictment as a pleading. The Government took an appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia under the D. C. appeals statute. The appellate court certified to this Court the question whether it had jurisdiction over an appeal where a § 3731-type challenge was joined with a challenge to the sufficiency of the indictment as a pleading. The Court disposed of the question by holding that the Criminal Appeals Act is inapplicable to any criminal case appealable under the provisions of the D. C. Code:
""The Criminal Appeals Act, in naming the courts from which appeals may be taken to this court, employs the phrase `district courts'; not `courts of the United States,' or `courts exercising the same jurisdiction as district courts.' We need not, however, determine whether the statute should be construed to embrace criminal cases tried in the Supreme Court of the District if § 935 of the District Code were not in effect. That section deals comprehensively with appeals in criminal cases from all of the courts of first instance of the District and *88 confers on the Court of Appeals jurisdiction of appeals by the Government seeking review of the judgments of those courts. The Criminal Appeals Act, on the other hand, affects only certain specified classes of decisions in district courts, contains no repealing clause, and no reference to the courts of the District of Columbia or the territorial courts, upon many of which jurisdiction is conferred by language quite similar to that of the Code of Law of the District. We cannot construe it as impliedly repealing the complete appellate system created for the District of Columbia by § 935 of the Code, in the absence of expression on the part of Congress indicating that purpose. Implied repeals are not favored; and if effect can reasonably be given to both statutes, the presumption is that the earlier is intended to remain in force. . . ."" 289 U.S., at 163-164.[3] (Emphasis added.)
The holding in Burroughs established a complete separation of the two statutory schemes for Government appeals in criminal cases; the essence of the Court's rationale was a presumption against implied repeals.
In 1942, Congress amended the Criminal Appeals Act to provide for Government appeals to the Courts of Appeals from all decisions dismissing indictments or arresting judgments of convictions except where a right of direct appeal to this Court exists. 56 Stat. 271. The new amendment expressly included the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit as *89 one of the intermediate appellate tribunals to which the Government could appeal;[4] in addition, the Act added a new provision to the Judicial Code establishing appellate jurisdiction in the then circuit courts of appeals ""in criminal cases on appeals taken by the United States in cases where such appeals are permitted by law."" 56 Stat. 272. The latter provision also expressly incorporated the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[5]Ibid.
The legislative history of the 1942 amendment offers no explication of congressional intent in including the D. C. courts within the Act.[6] It is certain that this amendment generates some form of overlap between the two statutory schemes for Governmental appeals in criminal cases. In Carroll v. United States, 354 U.S. 394, 411 (1957), the Court recognized the new situation created by the 1942 amendment:
""It may be concluded, then, that even today criminal appeals by the Government in the District of Columbia are not limited to the categories set forth in 18 U.S. C. § 3731, although as to cases of the type covered by that special jurisdictional statute, its explicit directions will prevail over the general terms of [the D. C. statute] . . . .""
That, however, leaves open the question which cases come within the categories set forth in 18 U.S. C. § 3731.


*90 III
After this Court's holding in Burroughs, it was clear that if Congress wished to effectuate any displacement of the pre-1907 route for Government appeals of criminal cases within the District of Columbia, some express manifestation of its intent was required. The 1942 amendment followed the Burroughs decision. Since Congress then acted to create some overlap between the two statutes without further limiting the categories of directly appealable criminal cases, it may be argued that we should presume Congress intended, as of 1942, to embrace within the very special appeals procedures of 18 U.S. C. § 3731 criminal cases based upon statutes applicable only within the District.
But that presumption from a completely silent legislative record flies in the face of the principle that statutes creating a right of direct appeal to this Court should be narrowly construed. Cf. Swift & Co. v. Wickham, 382 U.S. 111, 128-129 (1965); Florida Lime Growers v. Jacobsen, 362 U.S. 73, 92-93 (1960) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). And, in light of the legislative history of the 1907 Act and this Court's explicit holding in Burroughs that the 1907 Act had no impact on cases appealable under the D. C. provision, it is especially inappropriate to rely on the absence of any further limiting language in the 1942 amendment as a justification for reading the term ""statute"" as encompassing criminal prosecutions in the District based on local as well as nationwide statutes.
The legislative history of the 1907 Act suggests a perfectly plausible reason for interpreting the language ""based upon the invalidity or construction of the statute"" as excluding D. C. statutes: that language was put in the Act by Senator Clarke with the express intention of limiting the Act's goal to remedying the precise defect of *91 inconsistent enforcement of criminal statutes arising from the lack of a Government appeal. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit constitutes a perfectly adequate appellate tribunal for resolving conflicting interpretations given local statutes by judges within the District of Columbia.[7] Where, however, the Government brings a prosecution in the District of Columbia based on a statute of nationwide applicability, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit cannot achieve uniformity in the enforcement of the statute.
As an original proposition, then, a construction of the relevant provisions of the 1907 Act as excluding criminal cases in the District brought under local statutes but including cases brought under nationwide statutes would have been consistent both with the express purpose of Senator Clarke's amendment and the canon of strict construction as applied to direct appeals statutes.[8] But the *92 Court in Burroughs took the position that Congress could not displace the pre-existing appellate route to any extent without indicating an express intent to do so; Burroughs, significantly, involved a prosecution under a statute of nationwide applicability. Subsequently, Congress did expressly indicate an intent to displace the alternative appellate route available within the District. The extent of that displacement, I think, should now be measured by the express goal of the relevant provision of the 1907 Act, as limited by Senator Clarke: avoidance of inconsistent enforcement of criminal laws. That theory of legislative purposecombined with the Burroughs holding that Congress should be required to affirmatively indicate an intent to displace the prior appellate route yields an interpretation of the 1907 Act as amended in 1942 which is consistent with the canon of strict construction generally applied to direct appeals statutes.[9]


*93 IV
I have little doubt that, had the Criminal Appeals Act not been recently amended to dispense with direct appeals to this Court, see n. 1, supra, the interpretation of the Act I have suggested would be adopted by the Court. This Court has never taken jurisdiction over a direct appeal from a dismissal of a prosecution brought in the District of Columbia for violation of a statute applicable within the District. It is worth noting that, given the *94 Court's adherence to the principles of Carroll v. United States, supra, the rather absurd waste of our judicial resources on cases such as United States v. Waters, 175 F.2d 340, appeal dismissed on motion of the United States, 335 U.S. 869 (1948), and United States v. Sweet, 399 U.S. 517 (1970), see n. 8, supra, could not even be avoided by the exercise of governmental discretion in choosing appellate routes. In light of Carroll, I cannot believe that a perfectly acceptable reading of congressional purpose underpinning the definition of categories of cases directly appealable under 18 U.S. C. § 3731 which excludes statutes applicable only within the District of Columbia would have been turned down by the Court.
Of course, the recent elimination of the direct appeal route removes a great deal of the incentive to continue the stringent standards of construction with respect to this statute that have traditionally prevailed in this Court. Indeed, at this stage of the game, the canon of strict construction produces the ironic result of compelling a relatively greater expenditure of judicial energies in assessing our jurisdiction over the remainder of the criminal cases pending in the district courts of the Nation at the time of the most recent amendment than would be involved in deciding those cases on the merits. Nonetheless, this very Term we have indicated that we intend to adhere to the rules of construction evolved by this Court during the long and tortuous history of this statute. United States v. Weller, 401 U.S. 254 (1971).
The only response we are offered to the reading of congressional purpose I have suggested is that the interests of avoiding inconsistent enforcement of criminal laws argues for exercising jurisdiction over this case because similar statutes in other jurisdictions are under attack on vagueness grounds. See the Court's opinion, at 65-66. Surely those of my Brethren who subscribe to the views *95 on jurisdiction expressed in the opinion of the Court must recognize that we cannot limit the category of appealable cases under this provision of the Act to prosecutions brought under D. C. statutes which are (a) duplicated in other jurisdictions, and (b) under attack on similar federal question grounds in other jurisdictions. The proffered response is, therefore, not truly a reason for concluding we have jurisdiction over the relevant category of cases; rather, it is a reason for exercising our power in this one case to settle Dr. Vuitch's vagueness claim in spite of the absence of the jurisdictional prerequisites which legitimize the exercise of that judicial power.

V
Having concluded that the Government cannot directly appeal the dismissal of the indictments to this Court under the provisions of 18 U.S. C. § 3731, it also follows that we cannot utilize the remand provisions of that statute to reroute the appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. However, we do have jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction, and, in the analogous three-judge court situation where an alternative appellate route exists but the statute according this Court direct jurisdiction over the certain appeals includes no remand procedure, this Court has vacated the judgment of the court of original jurisdiction and remanded the case to that court for the entry of a fresh decree from which timely appeal may be taken to the proper appellate tribunal. Rockefeller v. Catholic Medical Center of Brooklyn & Queens, 397 U.S. 820 (1970). The instant case, of course, is a criminal prosecution, and there is a consideration not present in the three-judge court situation: i. e., the additional anxiety caused the defendant by virtue of the Government's erroneous choice of appellate routes. But, while 18 U.S. C. § 3731 *96 cannot empower us to transfer the case, that statute is still relevant as an expression of congressional policy to save the Government's appeal where an erroneous choice of appellate routes is made, even at the expense of additional anxiety to the defendant. Accordingly, I think the proper disposition of this case would be to vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand the case for the entry of a fresh judgment from which the Government could take a timely appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit pursuant to D. C. Code Ann. § 23-105.

VI
Notwithstanding the views on jurisdiction expressed above, and speaking only for myself, and not for those of my Brethren who agree with my discussion of the jurisdictional issue in this case, I have concluded, substantially for the reasons set forth in MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN'S separate opinion, that I should also reach the merits. Accordingly, I concur in Part II of the Court's opinion and the judgment of the Court.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, dissenting in part.
I agree that we have jurisdiction of this appeal for the reasons stated in Part I of the Court's opinion.
As to the merits of this controversy, I share at least some of the constitutional doubts about the abortion statute expressed by the District Court. But, as this Court today correctly points out, ""statutes should be construed whenever possible so as to uphold their constitutionality."" The statute before us can be so construed, I think, simply by extending the reasoning of the Court's opinion to its logical conclusion.
The statute legalizes any abortion performed ""under the direction of a competent licensed practitioner of medicine"" if ""necessary for the preservation of the mother's life or health."" Under the statute, therefore, *97 the legal practice of medicine in the District of Columbia includes the performing of abortions. For the practice of medicine consists of doing those things which, in the judgment of a physician, are necessary to preserve a patient's life or health. As the Court says, ""whether a particular operation is necessary for a patient's physical or mental health is a judgment that physicians are obviously called upon to make routinely whenever surgery is considered.""
It follows, I think, that when a physician has exercised his judgment in favor of performing an abortion, he has, by hypothesis, not violated the statute. To put it another way, I think the question of whether the performance of an abortion is ""necessary for the . . . mother's life or health"" is entrusted under the statute exclusively to those licensed to practice medicine, without the overhanging risk of incurring criminal liability at the hands of a second-guessing lay jury. I would hold, therefore, that ""a competent licensed practitioner of medicine"" is wholly immune from being charged with the commission of a criminal offense under this law.
It is true that the statute can be construed in other ways, as MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS has made clear. But I would give it the reading I have indicated ""in the candid service of avoiding a serious constitutional doubt."" United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41, 47.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN.
Although I join MR. JUSTICE HARLAN in his conclusion that this case is not properly here by direct appeal under 18 U.S. C. § 3731, a majority, and thus the Court, holds otherwise. The case is therefore here and requires decision.
The five Justices constituting the majority, however, are divided on the merits. One feels that D. C. Code Ann. § 22-201 (1967) lacks the requirements of procedural *98 due process and would affirm the dismissal of the indictments. One would hold that a licensed physician is immune from charge under the statute. Three would hold that, properly construed, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague and that the dismissal of the indictments on that ground was error.
Because of the inability of the jurisdictional-issue majority to agree upon the disposition of the case, I feel obligated not to remain silent as to the merits. See Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 134 (1945) (addendum by Mr. Justice Rutledge); United States v. Jorn, 400 U.S. 470, 487-488 (1971) (statement of BLACK and BRENNAN, JJ.); Mills v. Alabama, 384 U.S. 214, 222-223 (1966) (separate opinion of HARLAN, J.); Kesler v. Department of Public Safety, 369 U.S. 153, 174, 179 (1962) (STEWART, J., concurring in part, and Warren, C. J., dissenting). Assuming, as I must in the light of the Court's decision, that the Court does have jurisdiction of the appeal, I join Part II of MR. JUSTICE BLACK'S opinion and the judgment of the Court.
"
16980,Justice Brennan,majority,False,Eisenstadt v. Baird,,1972,2.0,"Appellee William Baird was convicted at a bench trial in the Massachusetts Superior Court under Massachusetts General Laws Ann., c. 272, § 21, first, for exhibiting contraceptive articles in the course of delivering a lecture on contraception to a group of students at Boston University and, second, for giving a young woman a package of Emko vaginal foam at the close of his address.[1] The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court unanimously set aside the conviction for exhibiting contraceptives on the ground that it violated Baird's First Amendment rights, but by a four-to-three vote sustained the conviction for giving away the foam. Commonwealth v. Baird, 355 Mass. 746, 247 N.E.2d 574 (1969). Baird subsequently filed a petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus, which the District Court dismissed. 310 F. Supp. 951 (1970). On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit vacated the dismissal and remanded the action with directions to grant the writ discharging Baird. 429 F.2d 1398 (1970). This appeal by the Sheriff of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, followed, and we noted probable jurisdiction. 401 U.S. 934 (1971). We affirm.
Massachusetts General Laws Ann., c. 272, § 21, under which Baird was convicted, provides a maximum five-year term of imprisonment for ""whoever . . . gives away . . . any drug, medicine, instrument or article whatever *441 for the prevention of conception,"" except as authorized in § 21A. Under § 21A, ""[a] registered physician may administer to or prescribe for any married person drugs or articles intended for the prevention of pregnancy or conception. [And a] registered pharmacist actually engaged in the business of pharmacy may furnish such drugs or articles to any married person presenting a prescription from a registered physician.""[2] As interpreted by the State Supreme Judicial *442 Court, these provisions make it a felony for anyone, other than a registered physician or pharmacist acting in accordance with the terms of § 21A, to dispense any article with the intention that it be used for the prevention of conception. The statutory scheme distinguishes among three distinct classes of distributeesfirst, married persons may obtain contraceptives to prevent pregnancy, but only from doctors or druggists on prescription; second, single persons may not obtain contraceptives from anyone to prevent pregnancy; and, third, married or single persons may obtain contraceptives from anyone to prevent, not pregnancy, but the spread of disease. This construction of state law is, of course, binding on us. E. g., Groppi v. Wisconsin, 400 U.S. 505, 507 (1971).
The legislative purposes that the statute is meant to serve are not altogether clear. In Commonwealth v. Baird, supra, the Supreme Judicial Court noted only the State's interest in protecting the health of its citizens: ""[T]he prohibition in § 21,"" the court declared, ""is directly related to"" the State's goal of ""preventing the distribution of articles designed to prevent conception which may have undesirable, if not dangerous, physical consequences."" 355 Mass., at 753, 247 N. E. 2d, at 578. In a subsequent decision, Sturgis v. Attorney General, 358 Mass. 37, ___, 260 N.E.2d 687, 690 (1970), the court, however, found ""a second and more compelling ground for upholding the statute""namely, to protect morals through ""regulating the private sexual lives of single persons.""[3] The Court of Appeals, for reasons that will *443 appear, did not consider the promotion of health or the protection of morals through the deterrence of fornication to be the legislative aim. Instead, the court concluded that the statutory goal was to limit contraception in and of itselfa purpose that the court held conflicted ""with fundamental human rights"" under Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), where this Court struck down Connecticut's prohibition against the use of contraceptives as an unconstitutional infringement of the right of marital privacy. 429 F.2d, at 1401-1402.
We agree that the goals of deterring premarital sex and regulating the distribution of potentially harmful articles cannot reasonably be regarded as legislative aims of §§ 21 and 21A. And we hold that the statute, viewed as a prohibition on contraception per se, violates the rights of single persons under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

I
We address at the outset appellant's contention that Baird does not have standing to assert the rights of unmarried persons denied access to contraceptives because he was neither an authorized distributor under § 21A nor a single person unable to obtain contraceptives. There can be no question, of course, that Baird has sufficient interest in challenging the statute's validity to satisfy the ""case or controversy"" requirement of Article III of the Constitution.[4] Appellant's argument, however, is that *444 this case is governed by the Court's self-imposed rules of restraint, first, that ""one to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional,"" United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 21 (1960), and, second, the ""closely related corollary that a litigant may only assert his own constitutional rights or immunities,"" id., at 22. Here, appellant contends that Baird's conviction rests on the restriction in § 21A on permissible distributors and that that restriction serves a valid health interest independent of the limitation on authorized distributees. Appellant urges, therefore, that Baird's action in giving away the foam fell squarely within the conduct that the legislature meant and had power to prohibit and that Baird should not be allowed to attack the statute in its application to potential recipients. In any event, appellant concludes, since Baird was not himself a single person denied access to contraceptives, he should not be heard to assert their rights. We cannot agree.
The Court of Appeals held that the statute under which Baird was convicted is not a health measure. If that view is correct, we do not see how Baird may be prevented, because he was neither a doctor nor a druggist, from attacking the statute in its alleged discriminatory application to potential distributees. We think, too, that our self-imposed rule against the assertion of third-party rights must be relaxed in this case just as in Griswold v. Connecticut, supra. There the Executive Director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut and a licensed physician who had prescribed contraceptives for married persons and been convicted as accessories to the crime of using contraceptives were held to have standing to raise the constitutional rights of the patients with whom they had a professional relationship. *445 Appellant here argues that the absence of a professional or aiding-and-abetting relationship distinguishes this case from Griswold. Yet, as the Court's discussion of prior authority in Griswold, 381 U. S., at 481, indicates, the doctor-patient and accessory-principal relationships are not the only circumstances in which one person has been found to have standing to assert the rights of another. Indeed, in Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U.S. 249 (1953), a seller of land was entitled to defend against an action for damages for breach of a racially restrictive covenant on the ground that enforcement of the covenant violated the equal protection rights of prospective non-Caucasian purchasers. The relationship there between the defendant and those whose rights he sought to assert was not simply the fortuitous connection between a vendor and potential vendees, but the relationship between one who acted to protect the rights of a minority and the minority itself. Sedler, Standing to Assert Constitutional Jus Tertii in the Supreme Court, 71 Yale L. J. 599, 631 (1962). And so here the relationship between Baird and those whose rights he seeks to assert is not simply that between a distributor and potential distributees, but that between an advocate of the rights of persons to obtain contraceptives and those desirous of doing so. The very point of Baird's giving away the vaginal foam was to challenge the Massachusetts statute that limited access to contraceptives.
In any event, more important than the nature of the relationship between the litigant and those whose rights he seeks to assert is the impact of the litigation on the third-party interests.[5] In Griswold, 381 U. S., at 481, the *446 Court stated: ""The rights of husband and wife, pressed here, are likely to be diluted or adversely affected unless those rights are considered in a suit involving those who have this kind of confidential relation to them."" A similar situation obtains here. Enforcement of the Massachusetts statute will materially impair the ability of single persons to obtain contraceptives. In fact, the case for according standing to assert third-party rights is stronger in this regard here than in Griswold because unmarried persons denied access to contraceptives in Massachusetts, unlike the users of contraceptives in Connecticut, are not themselves subject to prosecution and, to that extent, are denied a forum in which to assert their own rights. Cf. NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449 (1958); Barrows v. Jackson, supra.[6] The Massachusetts statute, unlike the Connecticut law considered in Griswold, prohibits, not use, but distribution.
For the foregoing reasons we hold that Baird, who is now in a position, and plainly has an adequate incentive, to assert the rights of unmarried persons denied access to contraceptives, has standing to do so. We turn to the merits.

II
The basic principles governing application of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment are familiar. AS THE CHIEF JUSTICE only recently explained in Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 75-76 (1971):
""In applying that clause, this Court has consistently recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment *447 does not deny to States the power to treat different classes of persons in different ways. Barbier v. Connolly, 113 U.S. 27 (1885); Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220 U.S. 61 (1911); Railway Express Agency v. New York, 336 U.S. 106 (1949); McDonald v. Board of Election Commissioners, 394 U.S. 802 (1969). The Equal Protection Clause of that amendment does, however, deny to States the power to legislate that different treatment be accorded to persons placed by a statute into different classes on the basis of criteria wholly unrelated to the objective of that statute. A classification `must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.' Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U.S. 412, 415 (1920).""
The question for our determination in this case is whether there is some ground of difference that rationally explains the different treatment accorded married and unmarried persons under Massachusetts General Laws Ann., c. 272, §§ 21 and 21A.[7] For the reasons that follow, we conclude that no such ground exists.
First. Section 21 stems from Mass. Stat. 1879, c. 159, § 1, which prohibited, without exception, distribution of articles intended to be used as contraceptives. In Commonwealth v. Allison, 227 Mass. 57, 62, 116 N.E. 265, *448 266 (1917), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court explained that the law's ""plain purpose is to protect purity, to preserve chastity, to encourage continence and self restraint, to defend the sanctity of the home, and thus to engender in the State and nation a virile and virtuous race of men and women."" Although the State clearly abandoned that purpose with the enactment of § 21A, at least insofar as the illicit sexual activities of married persons are concerned, see n. 3, supra, the court reiterated in Sturgis v. Attorney General, supra, that the object of the legislation is to discourage premarital sexual intercourse. Conceding that the State could, consistently with the Equal Protection Clause, regard the problems of extramarital and premarital sexual relations as ""[e]vils . . . of different dimensions and proportions, requiring different remedies,"" Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 489 (1955), we cannot agree that the deterrence of premarital sex may reasonably be regarded as the purpose of the Massachusetts law.
It would be plainly unreasonable to assume that Massachusetts has prescribed pregnancy and the birth of an unwanted child as punishment for fornication, which is a misdemeanor under Massachusetts General Laws Ann., c. 272, § 18. Aside from the scheme of values that assumption would attribute to the State, it is abundantly clear that the effect of the ban on distribution of contraceptives to unmarried persons has at best a marginal relation to the proffered objective. What Mr. Justice Goldberg said in Griswold v. Connecticut, supra, at 498 (concurring opinion), concerning the effect of Connecticut's prohibition on the use of contraceptives in discouraging extramarital sexual relations, is equally applicable here. ""The rationality of this justification is dubious, particularly in light of the admitted widespread availability to all persons in the State of Connecticut, unmarried as well as married, of birth-control devices for the *449 prevention of disease, as distinguished from the prevention of conception."" See also id., at 505-507 (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment). Like Connecticut's laws, §§ 21 and 21A do not at all regulate the distribution of contraceptives when they are to be used to prevent, not pregnancy, but the spread of disease. Commonwealth v. Corbett, 307 Mass. 7, 29 N.E.2d 151 (1940), cited with approval in Commonwealth v. Baird, 355 Mass., at 754, 247 N.E.2d, at 579. Nor, in making contraceptives available to married persons without regard to their intended use, does Massachusetts attempt to deter married persons from engaging in illicit sexual relations with unmarried persons. Even on the assumption that the fear of pregnancy operates as a deterrent to fornication, the Massachusetts statute is thus so riddled with exceptions that deterrence of premarital sex cannot reasonably be regarded as its aim.
Moreover, §§ 21 and 21A on their face have a dubious relation to the State's criminal prohibition on fornication. As the Court of Appeals explained, ""Fornication is a misdemeanor [in Massachusetts], entailing a thirty dollar fine, or three months in jail. Massachusetts General Laws Ann. c. 272 § 18. Violation of the present statute is a felony, punishable by five years in prison. We find it hard to believe that the legislature adopted a statute carrying a five-year penalty for its possible, obviously by no means fully effective, deterrence of the commission of a ninety-day misdemeanor."" 429 F.2d, at 1401. Even conceding the legislature a full measure of discretion in fashioning means to prevent fornication, and recognizing that the State may seek to deter prohibited conduct by punishing more severely those who facilitate than those who actually engage in its commission, we, like the Court of Appeals, cannot believe that in this instance Massachusetts has chosen to expose the aider and abetter who simply gives away a contraceptive to *450 20 times the 90-day sentence of the offender himself. The very terms of the State's criminal statutes, coupled with the de minimis effect of §§ 21 and 21A in deterring fornication, thus compel the conclusion that such deterrence cannot reasonably be taken as the purpose of the ban on distribution of contraceptives to unmarried persons.
Second. Section 21A was added to the Massachusetts General Laws by Stat. 1966, c. 265, § 1. The Supreme Judicial Court in Commonwealth v. Baird, supra, held that the purpose of the amendment was to serve the health needs of the community by regulating the distribution of potentially harmful articles. It is plain that Massachusetts had no such purpose in mind before the enactment of § 21A. As the Court of Appeals remarked, ""Consistent with the fact that the statute was contained in a chapter dealing with `Crimes Against Chastity, Morality, Decency and Good Order,' it was cast only in terms of morals. A physician was forbidden to prescribe contraceptives even when needed for the protection of health. Commonwealth v. Gardner, 1938, 300 Mass. 372, 15 N.E.2d 222."" 429 F. 2d, at 1401. Nor did the Court of Appeals ""believe that the legislature [in enacting § 21A] suddenly reversed its field and developed an interest in health. Rather, it merely made what it thought to be the precise accommodation necessary to escape the Griswold ruling."" Ibid.
Again, we must agree with the Court of Appeals. If health were the rationale of § 21A, the statute would be both discriminatory and overbroad. Dissenting in Commonwealth v. Baird, 355 Mass., at 758, 247 N.E.2d, at 581, Justices Whittemore and Cutter stated that they saw ""in § 21 and § 21A, read together, no public health purpose. If there is need to have a physician prescribe (and a pharmacist dispense) contraceptives, that need is as great for unmarried persons as for married persons."" *451 The Court of Appeals added: ""If the prohibition [on distribution to unmarried persons] . . . is to be taken to mean that the same physician who can prescribe for married patients does not have sufficient skill to protect the health of patients who lack a marriage certificate, or who may be currently divorced, it is illogical to the point of irrationality."" 429 F.2d, at 1401.[8] Furthermore, we must join the Court of Appeals in noting that not all contraceptives are potentially dangerous.[9] As a result, if the Massachusetts statute were a health measure, it would not only invidiously discriminate against the unmarried, but also be overbroad with respect to the married, a fact that the Supreme Judicial Court itself seems to have conceded in Sturgis v. Attorney General, 358 Mass., at ___, 260 N. E. 2d, at 690, where it noted that ""it may well be that certain contraceptive medication and devices constitute no hazard to health, in which event it could be argued that the statute swept too broadly in its prohibition."" ""In this posture,"" as the Court of *452 Appeals concluded, ""it is impossible to think of the statute as intended as a health measure for the unmarried, and it is almost as difficult to think of it as so intended even as to the married."" 429 F.2d, at 1401.
But if further proof that the Massachusetts statute is not a health measure is necessary, the argument of Justice Spiegel, who also dissented in Commonwealth v. Baird, 355 Mass., at 759, 247 N.E.2d, at 582, is conclusive: ""It is at best a strained conception to say that the Legislature intended to prevent the distribution of articles `which may have undesirable, if not dangerous, physical consequences.' If that was the Legislature's goal, § 21 is not required"" in view of the federal and state laws already regulating the distribution of harmful drugs. See Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, § 503, 52 Stat. 1051, as amended, 21 U.S. C. § 353; Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., c. 94, § 187A, as amended. We conclude, accordingly, that, despite the statute's superficial earmarks as a health measure, health, on the face of the statute, may no more reasonably be regarded as its purpose than the deterrence of premarital sexual relations.
Third. If the Massachusetts statute cannot be upheld as a deterrent to fornication or as a health measure, may it, nevertheless, be sustained simply as a prohibition on contraception? The Court of Appeals analysis ""led inevitably to the conclusion that, so far as morals are concerned, it is contraceptives per se that are considered immoral to the extent that Griswold will permit such a declaration."" 429 F.2d, at 1401-1402. The Court of Appeals went on to hold, id., at 1402:
""To say that contraceptives are immoral as such, and are to be forbidden to unmarried persons who will nevertheless persist in having intercourse, means that such persons must risk for themselves an unwanted pregnancy, for the child, illegitimacy, and *453 for society, a possible obligation of support. Such a view of morality is not only the very mirror image of sensible legislation; we consider that it conflicts with fundamental human rights. In the absence of demonstrated harm, we hold it is beyond the competency of the state.""
We need not and do not, however, decide that important question in this case because, whatever the rights of the individual to access to contraceptives may be, the rights must be the same for the unmarried and the married alike.
If under Griswold the distribution of contraceptives to married persons cannot be prohibited, a ban on distribution to unmarried persons would be equally impermissible. It is true that in Griswold the right of privacy in question inhered in the marital relationship. Yet the marital couple is not an independent entity with a mind and heart of its own, but an association of two individuals each with a separate intellectual and emotional makeup. If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child. See Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557 (1969).[10] See also Skinner v. Oklahoma, *454 316 U.S. 535 (1942); Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 29 (1905).
On the other hand, if Griswold is no bar to a prohibition on the distribution of contraceptives, the State could not, consistently with the Equal Protection Clause, outlaw distribution to unmarried but not to married persons. In each case the evil, as perceived by the State, would be identical, and the underinclusion would be invidious. Mr. Justice Jackson, concurring in Railway Express Agency v. New York, 336 U.S. 106, 112-113 (1949), made the point:
""The framers of the Constitution knew, and we should not forget today, that there is no more effective practical guaranty against arbitrary and unreasonable government than to require that the principles of law which officials would impose upon a minority must be imposed generally. Conversely, nothing opens the door to arbitrary action so effectively as to allow those officials to pick and choose only a few to whom they will apply legislation and thus to escape the political retribution that might be visited upon them if larger numbers were affected. Courts can take no better measure to assure that laws will be just than to require that laws be equal in operation.""
Although Mr. Justice Jackson's comments had reference to administrative regulations, the principle he affirmed has equal application to the legislation here. We hold that by providing dissimilar treatment for married and unmarried persons who are similarly situated, Massachusetts *455 General Laws Ann., c. 272, §§ 21 and 21A, violate the Equal Protection Clause. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
MR."
16981,Justice Douglas,concurring,False,Eisenstadt v. Baird,,1972,2.0,"While I join the opinion of the Court, there is for me a narrower ground for affirming the Court of Appeals. This to me is a simple First Amendment case, that amendment being applicable to the States by reason of the Fourteenth. Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359.
Under no stretch of the law as presently stated could Massachusetts require a license for those who desire to lecture on planned parenthood, contraceptives, the rights of women, birth control, or any allied subject, or place a tax on that privilege. As to license taxes on First Amendment rights we said in Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105, 115:
""A license tax certainly does not acquire constitutional validity because it classifies the privileges protected by the First Amendment along with the wares and merchandise of hucksters and peddlers and treats them all alike. Such equality in treatment does not save the ordinance. Freedom of press, freedom of speech, freedom of religion are in a preferred position.""
We held in Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, that a person speaking at a labor union rally could not be required to register or obtain a license:
""As a matter of principle a requirement of registration in order to make a public speech would seem generally incompatible with an exercise of the rights *456 of free speech and free assembly. Lawful public assemblies, involving no element of grave and immediate danger to an interest the State is entitled to protect, are not instruments of harm which require previous identification of the speakers. And the right either of workmen or of unions under these conditions to assemble and discuss their own affairs is as fully protected by the Constitution as the right of businessmen, farmers, educators, political party members or others to assemble and discuss their affairs and to enlist the support of others.

.....
"". . . If one who solicits support for the cause of labor may be required to register as a condition to the exercise of his right to make a public speech, so may he who seeks to rally support for any social, business, religious or political cause. We think a requirement that one must register before he undertakes to make a public speech to enlist support for a lawful movement is quite incompatible with the requirements of the First Amendment."" Id., at 539, 540.
Baird addressed an audience of students and faculty at Boston University on the subject of birth control and overpopulation. His address was approximately one hour in length and consisted of a discussion of various contraceptive devices displayed by means of diagrams on two demonstration boards, as well as a display of contraceptive devices in their original packages. In addition, Baird spoke of the respective merits of various contraceptive devices; overpopulation in the world; crises throughout the world due to overpopulation; the large number of abortions performed on unwed mothers; and quack abortionists and the potential harm to women resulting from abortions performed by quack abortionists. Baird also urged members of the audience to petition the Massachusetts Legislature and to make known their feelings *457 with regard to birth control laws in order to bring about a change in the laws. At the close of the address Baird invited members of the audience to come to the stage and help themselves to the contraceptive articles. We do not know how many accepted Baird's invitation. We only know that Baird personally handed one woman a package of Emko Vaginal Foam. He was then arrested and indicted (1) for exhibiting contraceptive devices and (2) for giving one such device away. The conviction for the first offense was reversed, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts holding that the display of the articles was essential to a graphic representation of the lecture. But the conviction for the giving away of one article was sustained. 355 Mass. 746, 247 N.E.2d 574. The case reaches us by federal habeas corpus.
Had Baird not ""given away"" a sample of one of the devices whose use he advocated, there could be no question about the protection afforded him by the First Amendment. A State may not ""contract the spectrum of available knowledge."" Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 482. See also Thomas v. Collins, supra; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510; Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390. However noxious Baird's ideas might have been to the authorities, the freedom to learn about them, fully to comprehend their scope and portent, and to weigh them against the tenets of the ""conventional wisdom,"" may not be abridged. Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1. Our system of government requires that we have faith in the ability of the individual to decide wisely, if only he is fully apprised of the merits of a controversy.
""Freedom of discussion, if it would fulfill its historic function in this nation, must embrace all issues about which information is needed or appropriate to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of their period."" Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88, 102.
The teachings of Baird and those of Galileo might be *458 of a different order; but the suppression of either is equally repugnant.
As Milton said in the Areopagitica, ""Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties.""
It is said that only Baird's conduct is involved and United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, is cited. That case involved a registrant under the Selective Service Act burning his Selective Service draft card. When prosecuted for that act, he defended his conduct as ""symbolic speech."" The Court held it was not.
Whatever may be thought of that decision on the merits,[1]O'Brien is not controlling here. The distinction between ""speech"" and ""conduct"" is a valid one, insofar as it helps to determine in a particular case whether the purpose of the activity was to aid in the communication of ideas, and whether the form of the communication so interferes with the rights of others that reasonable regulations may be imposed.[2] See Public Utilities Comm'n v. Pollak, 343 U.S. 451, 467 (DOUGLAS, J., dissenting). *459 Thus, excessive noise might well be ""conduct""a form of pollutionwhich can be made subject to precise, narrowly drawn regulations. See Adderley v. Florida, 385 U.S. 39, 54 (DOUGLAS, J., dissenting). But ""this Court has repeatedly stated, [First Amendment] rights are not confined to verbal expression. They embrace appropriate types of action . . . ."" Brown v. Louisiana, 383 U.S. 131, 141-142.
Baird gave an hour's lecture on birth control and as an aid to understanding the ideas which he was propagating he handed out one sample of one of the devices whose use he was endorsing. A person giving a lecture on coyote-getters would certainly improve his teaching technique if he passed one out to the audience; and he would be protected in doing so unless of course the device was loaded and ready to explode, killing or injuring people. The same holds true in my mind for mousetraps, spray guns, or any other article not dangerous per se on which speakers give educational lectures.
It is irrelevant to the application of these principles that Baird went beyond the giving of information about birth control and advocated the use of contraceptive articles. The First Amendment protects the opportunity to persuade to action whether that action be unwise or immoral, or whether the speech incites to action. See, e. g., Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444; Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229; Terminiello v. Chicago, supra.
In this case there was not even incitement to action.[3] There is no evidence or finding that Baird intended that the young lady take the foam home with her when he handed it to her or that she would not have examined the *460 article and then returned it to Baird, had he not been placed under arrest immediately upon handing the article over.[4]
First Amendment rights are not limited to verbal expression.[5] The right to petition often involves the right to walk. The right of assembly may mean pushing or jostling. Picketing involves physical activity as well as a display of a sign. A sit-in can be a quiet, dignified protest that has First Amendment protection even though no speech is involved, as we held in Brown v. Louisiana, supra. Putting contraceptives on display is certainly an aid to speech and discussion. Handing an article under discussion to a member of the audience is a technique known to all teachers and is commonly used. A handout may be on such a scale as to smack of a vendor's marketing scheme. But passing one article to an audience is merely a projection of the visual aid and should be a permissible adjunct of free speech. Baird was not making a prescription nor purporting to give medical advice. Handing out the article was not even a suggestion that the lady use it. At most it suggested that she become familiar with the product line.
I do not see how we can have a Society of the Dialogue, which the First Amendment envisages, if time-honored teaching techniques are barred to those who give educational lectures.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins, concurring in the result.
In Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), we reversed criminal convictions for advising married persons *461 with respect to the use of contraceptives. As there applied, the Connecticut law, which forbade using contraceptives or giving advice on the subject, unduly invaded a zone of marital privacy protected by the Bill of Rights. The Connecticut law did not regulate the manufacture or sale of such products and we expressly left open any question concerning the permissible scope of such legislation. 381 U.S., at 485.
Chapter 272, § 21, of the Massachusetts General Laws makes it a criminal offense to distribute, sell, or give away any drug, medicine, or article for the prevention of conception. Section 21A excepts from this prohibition registered physicians who prescribe for and administer such articles to married persons and registered pharmacists who dispense on medical prescription.[1]
*462 Appellee Baird was indicted for giving away Emko Vaginal Foam, a ""medicine and article for the prevention of conception . . . .""[2] The State did not purport to charge or convict Baird for distributing to an unmarried person. No proof was offered as to the marital status of the recipient. The gravamen of the offense charged was that Baird had no license and therefore no authority to distribute to anyone. As the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts noted, the constitutional validity of Baird's conviction rested upon his lack of status as a ""distributor and not . . . the marital status of the recipient."" Commonwealth v. Baird, 355 Mass. 746, 753, 247 N.E.2d 574, 578 (1969). The Federal District Court was of the same view.[3]
*463 I assume that a State's interest in the health of its citizens empowers it to restrict to medical channels the distribution of products whose use should be accompanied by medical advice. I also do not doubt that various contraceptive medicines and articles are properly available only on prescription, and I therefore have no difficulty with the Massachusetts court's characterization of the statute at issue here as expressing ""a legitimate interest in preventing the distribution of articles designed to prevent conception which may have undesirable, if not dangerous, physical consequences."" Id., at 753, 247 N.E.2d, at 578. Had Baird distributed a supply of the so-called ""pill,"" I would sustain his conviction under this statute.[4] Requiring a prescription to obtain potentially dangerous contraceptive material may place a substantial burden upon the right recognized in Griswold, but that burden is justified by a strong state interest and does not, as did the statute at issue in Griswold, sweep unnecessarily broadly or seek ""to achieve its goals by means having a maximum destructive impact upon"" a protected relationship. Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S., at 485.
Baird, however, was found guilty of giving away vaginal foam. Inquiry into the validity of this conviction does not come to an end merely because some contraceptives are harmful and their distribution may be restricted. Our general reluctance to question a State's judgment on matters of public health must give way where, as here, the restriction at issue burdens the constitutional *464 rights of married persons to use contraceptives. In these circumstances we may not accept on faith the State's classification of a particular contraceptive as dangerous to health. Due regard for protecting constitutional rights requires that the record contain evidence that a restriction on distribution of vaginal foam is essential to achieve the statutory purpose, or the relevant facts concerning the product must be such as to fall within the range of judicial notice.
Neither requirement is met here. Nothing in the record even suggests that the distribution of vaginal foam should be accompanied by medical advice in order to protect the user's health. Nor does the opinion of the Massachusetts court or the State's brief filed here marshal facts demonstrating that the hazards of using vaginal foam are common knowledge or so incontrovertible that they may be noticed judicially. On the contrary, the State acknowledges that Emko is a product widely available without prescription. Given Griswold v. Connecticut, supra, and absent proof of the probable hazards of using vaginal foam, we could not sustain appellee's conviction had it been for selling or giving away foam to a married person. Just as in Griswold, where the right of married persons to use contraceptives was ""diluted or adversely affected"" by permitting a conviction for giving advice as to its exercise, id., at 481, so here, to sanction a medical restriction upon distribution of a contraceptive not proved hazardous to health would impair the exercise of the constitutional right.
That Baird could not be convicted for distributing Emko to a married person disposes of this case. Assuming, arguendo, that the result would be otherwise had the recipient been unmarried, nothing has been placed in the record to indicate her marital status. The State has maintained that marital status is irrelevant because an unlicensed person cannot legally dispense vaginal foam *465 either to married or unmarried persons. This approach is plainly erroneous and requires the reversal of Baird's conviction; for on the facts of this case, it deprives us of knowing whether Baird was in fact convicted for making a constitutionally protected distribution of Emko to a married person.
The principle established in Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359 (1931), and consistently adhered to is that a conviction cannot stand where the ""record fail[s] to prove that the conviction was not founded upon a theory which could not constitutionally support a verdict."" Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 576, 586 (1969). To uphold a conviction even ""though we cannot know that it did not rest on the invalid constitutional ground . . . would be to countenance a procedure which would cause a serious impairment of constitutional rights."" Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U.S. 287, 292 (1942).
Because this case can be disposed of on the basis of settled constitutional doctrine, I perceive no reason for reaching the novel constitutional question whether a State may restrict or forbid the distribution of contraceptives to the unmarried. Cf. Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288, 345-348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).
MR."
16982,Justice Burger,dissenting,False,Eisenstadt v. Baird,,1972,2.0,"The judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in sustaining appellee's conviction for dispensing medicinal material without a license seems eminently correct to me and I would not disturb it. It is undisputed that appellee is not a physician or pharmacist and was prohibited under Massachusetts law from dispensing contraceptives to anyone, regardless of marital status. To my mind the validity of this restriction on dispensing medicinal substances is the only issue before the Court, *466 and appellee has no standing to challenge that part of the statute restricting the persons to whom contraceptives are available. There is no need to labor this point, however, for everyone seems to agree that if Massachusetts has validly required, as a health measure, that all contraceptives be dispensed by a physician or pursuant to a physician's prescription, then the statutory distinction based on marital status has no bearing on this case. United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 21 (1960).
The opinion of the Court today brushes aside appellee's status as an unlicensed layman by concluding that the Massachusetts Legislature was not really concerned with the protection of health when it passed this statute. MR. JUSTICE WHITE acknowledges the statutory concern with the protection of health, but finds the restriction on distributors overly broad because the State has failed to adduce facts showing the health hazards of the particular substance dispensed by appellee as distinguished from other contraceptives. MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS' concurring opinion does not directly challenge the power of Massachusetts to prohibit laymen from dispensing contraceptives, but considers that appellee rather than dispensing the substance was resorting to a ""time-honored teaching technique"" by utilizing a ""visual aid"" as an adjunct to his protected speech. I am puzzled by this third characterization of the case. If the suggestion is that appellee was merely displaying the contraceptive material without relinquishing his ownership of it, then the argument must be that the prosecution failed to prove that appellee had ""given away"" the contraceptive material. But appellee does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence, and himself summarizes the record as showing that ""at the close of his lecture he invited members of the audience . . . to come and help themselves."" On the other hand, if the concurring opinion means that the First Amendment protects the distribution *467 of all articles ""not dangerous per se"" when the distribution is coupled with some form of speech, then I must confess that I have misread certain cases in the area. See, e. g., United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376 (1968); Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536, 555 (1965); Giboney v. Empire Storage Co., 336 U.S. 490, 502 (1949).
My disagreement with the opinion of the Court and that of MR. JUSTICE WHITE goes far beyond mere puzzlement, however, for these opinions seriously invade the constitutional prerogatives of the States and regrettably hark back to the heyday of substantive due process.
In affirming appellee's conviction, the highest tribunal in Massachusetts held that the statutory requirement that contraceptives be dispensed only through medical channels served the legitimate interest of the State in protecting the health of its citizens. The Court today blithely hurdles this authoritative state pronouncement and concludes that the statute has no such purpose. Three basic arguments are advanced: First, since the distribution of contraceptives was prohibited as a moral matter in Massachusetts prior to 1966, it is impossible to believe that the legislature was concerned with health when it lifted the complete ban but insisted on medical supervision. I fail to see why the historical predominance of an unacceptable legislative purpose makes incredible the emergence of a new and valid one.[1] See McGowan *468 v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 445-449 (1961). The second argument, finding its origin in a dissenting opinion in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, rejects a health purpose because, ""[i]f there is need to have a physician prescribe . . . contraceptives, that need is as great for unmarried persons as for married persons."" 355 Mass. 746, 758, 247 N.E.2d 574, 581. This argument confuses the validity of the restriction on distributors with the validity of the further restriction on distributees, a part of the statute not properly before the Court. Assuming the legislature too broadly restricted the class of persons who could obtain contraceptives, it hardly follows that it saw no need to protect the health of all persons to whom they are made available. Third, the Court sees no health purpose underlying the restriction on distributors because other state and federal laws regulate the distribution of harmful drugs. I know of no rule that all enactments relating to a particular purpose must be neatly consolidated in one package in the statute books for, if so, the United States Code will not pass muster. I am unable to draw any inference as to legislative purpose from the fact that the restriction on dispensing contraceptives was not codified with other statutory provisions regulating the distribution of medicinal substances. And the existence of nonconflicting, nonpre-emptive federal laws is simply without significance in judging the validity or purpose of a state law on the same subject matter.
It is possible, of course, that some members of the Massachusetts Legislature desired contraceptives to be dispensed only through medical channels in order to minimize their use, rather than to protect the health of their users, but I do not think it is the proper function of this Court to dismiss as dubious a state court's explication of a state statute absent overwhelming and irrefutable reasons for doing so.
*469 MR. JUSTICE WHITE, while acknowledging a valid legislative purpose of protecting health, concludes that the State lacks power to regulate the distribution of the contraceptive involved in this case as a means of protecting health.[2] The opinion grants that appellee's conviction would be valid if he had given away a potentially harmful substance, but rejects the State's placing this particular contraceptive in that category. So far as I am aware, this Court has never before challenged the police power of a State to protect the public from the risks of possibly spurious and deleterious substances sold within its borders. Moreover, a statutory classification is not invalid
""simply because some innocent articles or transactions may be found within the proscribed class. The inquiry must be whether, considering the end in view, the statute passes the bounds of reason and assumes the character of a merely arbitrary fiat."" Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, 226 U.S. 192, 204 (1912).
But since the Massachusetts statute seeks to protect health by regulating contraceptives, the opinion invokes Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), and puts the statutory classification to an unprecedented test: either the record must contain evidence supporting the classification or the health hazards of the particular contraceptive must be judicially noticeable. This is indeed a novel constitutional doctrine and not surprisingly no authority is cited for it.
Since the potential harmfulness of this particular medicinal substance has never been placed in issue in the *470 state or federal courts, the State can hardly be faulted for its failure to build a record on this point. And it totally mystifies me why, in the absence of some evidence in the record, the factual underpinnings of the statutory classification must be ""incontrovertible"" or a matter of ""common knowledge.""
The actual hazards of introducing a particular foreign substance into the human body are frequently controverted, and I cannot believe that unanimity of expert opinion is a prerequisite to a State's exercise of its police power, no matter what the subject matter of the regulation. Even assuming no present dispute among medical authorities, we cannot ignore that it has become commonplace for a drug or food additive to be universally regarded as harmless on one day and to be condemned as perilous on the next. It is inappropriate for this Court to overrule a legislative classification by relying on the present consensus among leading authorities. The commands of the Constitution cannot fluctuate with the shifting tides of scientific opinion.
Even if it were conclusively established once and for all that the product dispensed by appellee is not actually or potentially dangerous in the somatic sense, I would still be unable to agree that the restriction on dispensing it falls outside the State's power to regulate in the area of health. The choice of a means of birth control, although a highly personal matter, is also a health matter in a very real sense, and I see nothing arbitrary in a requirement of medical supervision.[3] It is generally acknowledged that contraceptives vary in degree of effectiveness *471 and potential harmfulness.[4] There may be compelling health reasons for certain women to choose the most effective means of birth control available, no matter how harmless the less effective alternatives.[5] Others might be advised not to use a highly effective means of contraception because of their peculiar susceptibility to an adverse side effect.[6] Moreover, there may be information known to the medical profession that a particular brand of contraceptive is to be preferred or avoided, or that it has not been adequately tested. Nonetheless, the concurring opinion would hold, as a constitutional matter, that a State must allow someone without medical training the same power to distribute this medicinal substance as is enjoyed by a physician.
It is revealing, I think, that those portions of the majority and concurring opinions rejecting the statutory limitation on distributors rely on no particular provision of the Constitution. I see nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment or any other part of the Constitution *472 that even vaguely suggests that these medicinal forms of contraceptives must be available in the open market. I do not challenge Griswold v. Connecticut, supra, despite its tenuous moorings to the text of the Constitution, but I cannot view it as controlling authority for this case. The Court was there confronted with a statute flatly prohibiting the use of contraceptives, not one regulating their distribution. I simply cannot believe that the limitation on the class of lawful distributors has significantly impaired the right to use contraceptives in Massachusetts. By relying on Griswold in the present context, the Court has passed beyond the penumbras of the specific guarantees into the uncircumscribed area of personal predilections.
The need for dissemination of information on birth control is not impinged in the slightest by limiting the distribution of medicinal substances to medical and pharmaceutical channels as Massachusetts has done by statute. The appellee has succeeded, it seems, in cloaking his activities in some new permutation of the First Amendment although his conviction rests in fact and law on dispensing a medicinal substance without a license. I am constrained to suggest that if the Constitution can be strained to invalidate the Massachusetts statute underlying appellee's conviction, we could quite as well employ it for the protection of a ""curbstone quack,"" reminiscent of the ""medicine man"" of times past, who attracted a crowd of the curious with a soapbox lecture and then plied them with ""free samples"" of some unproved remedy. Massachusetts presumably outlawed such activities long ago, but today's holding seems to invite their return.
"
14891,Justice Blackmun,majority,False,Doe v. Bolton,,1973,2.0,"In this appeal, the criminal abortion statutes recently enacted in Georgia are challenged on constitutional grounds. The statutes are §§ 26-1201 through 26-1203 of the State's Criminal Code, formulated by Georgia Laws, 1968 Session, pp. 1249, 1277-1280. In Roe v. Wade, ante, p. 113, we today have struck down, as constitutionally defective, the Texas criminal abortion statutes that are representative of provisions long in effect *182 in a majority of our States. The Georgia legislation, however, is different and merits separate consideration.

I
The statutes in question are reproduced as Appendix A, post, p. 202.[1] As the appellants acknowledge,[2] the 1968 statutes are patterned upon the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code, § 230.3 (Proposed Official Draft, 1962), reproduced as Appendix B, post, p. 205. The ALI proposal has served as the model for recent legislation in approximately one-fourth of our States.[3] The new Georgia provisions replaced statutory law that had been in effect for more than 90 years. Georgia Laws 1876, No. 130, § 2, at 113.[4] The predecessor statute paralleled *183 the Texas legislation considered in Roe v. Wade, supra, and made all abortions criminal except those necessary ""to preserve the life"" of the pregnant woman. The new statutes have not been tested on constitutional grounds in the Georgia state courts.
Section 26-1201, with a referenced exception, makes abortion a crime, and § 26-1203 provides that a person convicted of that crime shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than one nor more than 10 years. Section 26-1202 (a) states the exception and removes from § 1201's definition of criminal abortion, and thus makes noncriminal, an abortion ""performed by a physician duly licensed"" in Georgia when, ""based upon his best clinical judgment . . . an abortion is necessary because:
""(1) A continuation of the pregnancy would endanger the life of the pregnant woman or would seriously and permanently injure her health; or
""(2) The fetus would very likely be born with a grave, permanent, and irremediable mental or physical defect; or
""(3) The pregnancy resulted from forcible or statutory rape.""[5]
Section 26-1202 also requires, by numbered subdivisions of its subsection (b), that, for an abortion to be authorized *184 or performed as a noncriminal procedure, additional conditions must be fulfilled. These are (1) and (2) residence of the woman in Georgia; (3) reduction to writing of the performing physician's medical judgment that an abortion is justified for one or more of the reasons specified by § 26-1202 (a), with written concurrence in that judgment by at least two other Georgia-licensed physicians, based upon their separate personal medical examinations of the woman; (4) performance of the abortion in a hospital licensed by the State Board of Health and also accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals; (5) advance approval by an abortion committee of not less than three members of the hospital's staff; (6) certifications in a rape situation; and (7), (8), and (9) maintenance and confidentiality of records. There is a provision (subsection (c)) for judicial determination of the legality of a proposed abortion on petition of the judicial circuit law officer or of a close relative, as therein defined, of the unborn child, and for expeditious hearing of that petition. There is also a provision (subsection (e)) giving a hospital the right not to admit an abortion patient and giving any physician and any hospital employee or staff member the right, on moral or religious grounds, not to participate in the procedure.

II
On April 16, 1970, Mary Doe,[6] 23 other individuals (nine described as Georgia-licensed physicians, seven as nurses registered in the State, five as clergymen, and two as social workers), and two nonprofit Georgia corporations that advocate abortion reform instituted this federal action in the Northern District of Georgia against the State's attorney general, the district attorney of *185 Fulton County, and the chief of police of the city of Atlanta. The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the Georgia abortion statutes were unconstitutional in their entirety. They also sought injunctive relief restraining the defendants and their successors from enforcing the statutes.
Mary Doe alleged:
(1) She was a 22-year-old Georgia citizen, married, and nine weeks pregnant. She had three living children. The two older ones had been placed in a foster home because of Doe's poverty and inability to care for them. The youngest, born July 19, 1969, had been placed for adoption. Her husband had recently abandoned her and she was forced to live with her indigent parents and their eight children. She and her husband, however, had become reconciled. He was a construction worker employed only sporadically. She had been a mental patient at the State Hospital. She had been advised that an abortion could be performed on her with less danger to her health than if she gave birth to the child she was carrying. She would be unable to care for or support the new child.
(2) On March 25, 1970, she applied to the Abortion Committee of Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, for a therapeutic abortion under § 26-1202. Her application was denied 16 days later, on April 10, when she was eight weeks pregnant, on the ground that her situation was not one described in § 26-1202 (a).[7]
(3) Because her application was denied, she was forced either to relinquish ""her right to decide when and how many children she will bear"" or to seek an abortion that was illegal under the Georgia statutes. This invaded her *186 rights of privacy and liberty in matters related to family, marriage, and sex, and deprived her of the right to choose whether to bear children. This was a violation of rights guaranteed her by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The statutes also denied her equal protection and procedural due process and, because they were unconstitutionally vague, deterred hospitals and doctors from performing abortions. She sued ""on her own behalf and on behalf of all others similarly situated.""
The other plaintiffs alleged that the Georgia statutes ""chilled and deterred"" them from practicing their respective professions and deprived them of rights guaranteed by the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments. These plaintiffs also purported to sue on their own behalf and on behalf of others similarly situated.
A three-judge district court was convened. An offer of proof as to Doe's identity was made, but the court deemed it unnecessary to receive that proof. The case was then tried on the pleadings and interrogatories.
The District Court, per curiam, 319 F. Supp. 1048 (ND Ga. 1970), held that all the plaintiffs had standing but that only Doe presented a justiciable controversy. On the merits, the court concluded that the limitation in the Georgia statute of the ""number of reasons for which an abortion may be sought,"" id., at 1056, improperly restricted Doe's rights of privacy articulated in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), and of ""personal liberty,"" both of which it thought ""broad enough to include the decision to abort a pregnancy,"" 319 F. Supp., at 1055. As a consequence, the court held invalid those portions of §§ 26-1202 (a) and (b) (3) limiting legal abortions to the three situations specified; § 26-1202 (b) (6) relating to certifications in a rape situation; and § 26-1202 (c) authorizing a court test. Declaratory relief was granted accordingly. The court, however, held *187 that Georgia's interest in protection of health, and the existence of a ""potential of independent human existence"" (emphasis in original), id., at 1055, justified state regulation of ""the manner of performance as well as the quality of the final decision to abort,"" id., at 1056, and it refused to strike down the other provisions of the statutes. It denied the request for an injunction, id., at 1057.
Claiming that they were entitled to an injunction and to broader relief, the plaintiffs took a direct appeal pursuant to 28 U.S. C. § 1253. We postponed decision on jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits. 402 U.S. 941 (1971). The defendants also purported to appeal, pursuant to § 1253, but their appeal was dismissed for want of jurisdiction. 402 U.S. 936 (1971). We are advised by the appellees, Brief 42, that an alternative appeal on their part is pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The extent, therefore, to which the District Court decision was adverse to the defendants, that is, the extent to which portions of the Georgia statutes were held to be unconstitutional, technically is not now before us.[8]Swarb v. Lennox, 405 U.S. 191, 201 (1972).

III
Our decision in Roe v. Wade, ante, p. 113, establishes (1) that, despite her pseudonym, we may accept as true, for this case, Mary Doe's existence and her pregnant state on April 16, 1970; (2) that the constitutional issue is substantial; (3) that the interim termination of Doe's and all other Georgia pregnancies in existence in 1970 has not rendered the case moot; and (4) that Doe presents a justiciable controversy and has standing to maintain the action.
*188 Inasmuch as Doe and her class are recognized, the question whether the other appellantsphysicians, nurses, clergymen, social workers, and corporations present a justiciable controversy and have standing is perhaps a matter of no great consequence. We conclude, however, that the physician-appellants, who are Georgia-licensed doctors consulted by pregnant women, also present a justiciable controversy and do have standing despite the fact that the record does not disclose that any one of them has been prosecuted, or threatened with prosecution, for violation of the State's abortion statutes. The physician is the one against whom these criminal statutes directly operate in the event he procures an abortion that does not meet the statutory exceptions and conditions. The physician-appellants, therefore, assert a sufficiently direct threat of personal detriment. They should not be required to await and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief. Crossen v. Breckenridge, 446 F.2d 833, 839-840 (CA6 1971); Poe v. Menghini, 339 F. Supp. 986, 990-991 (Kan. 1972).
In holding that the physicians, while theoretically possessed of standing, did not present a justiciable controversy, the District Court seems to have relied primarily on Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497 (1961). There, a sharply divided Court dismissed an appeal from a state court on the ground that it presented no real controversy justifying the adjudication of a constitutional issue. But the challenged Connecticut statute, deemed to prohibit the giving of medical advice on the use of contraceptives, had been enacted in 1879, and, apparently with a single exception, no one had ever been prosecuted under it. Georgia's statute, in contrast, is recent and not moribund. Furthermore, it is the successor to another *189 Georgia abortion statute under which, we are told,[9] physicians were prosecuted. The present case, therefore, is closer to Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97 (1968), where the Court recognized the right of a school teacher, though not yet charged criminally, to challenge her State's anti-evolution statute. See also Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S., at 481.
The parallel claims of the nurse, clergy, social worker, and corporation-appellants are another step removed and as to them, the Georgia statutes operate less directly. Not being licensed physicians, the nurses and the others are in no position to render medical advice. They would be reached by the abortion statutes only in their capacity as accessories or as counselor-conspirators. We conclude that we need not pass upon the status of these additional appellants in this suit, for the issues are sufficiently and adequately presented by Doe and the physician-appellants, and nothing is gained or lost by the presence or absence of the nurses, the clergymen, the social workers, and the corporations. See Roe v. Wade, ante, at 127.

IV
The appellants attack on several grounds those portions of the Georgia abortion statutes that remain after the District Court decision: undue restriction of a right to personal and marital privacy; vagueness; deprivation of substantive and procedural due process; improper restriction to Georgia residents; and denial of equal protection.
A. Roe v. Wade, supra, sets forth our conclusion that a pregnant woman does not have an absolute constitutional right to an abortion on her demand. What is said there is applicable here and need not be repeated.
*190 B. The appellants go on to argue, however, that the present Georgia statutes must be viewed historically, that is, from the fact that prior to the 1968 Act an abortion in Georgia was not criminal if performed to ""preserve the life"" of the mother. It is suggested that the present statute, as well, has this emphasis on the mother's rights, not on those of the fetus. Appellants contend that it is thus clear that Georgia has given little, and certainly not first, consideration to the unborn child. Yet, it is the unborn child's rights that Georgia asserts in justification of the statute. Appellants assert that this justification cannot be advanced at this late date.
Appellants then argue that the statutes do not adequately protect the woman's right. This is so because it would be physically and emotionally damaging to Doe to bring a child into her poor, ""fatherless""[10] family, and because advances in medicine and medical techniques have made it safer for a woman to have a medically induced abortion than for her to bear a child. Thus, ""a statute that requires a woman to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term infringes not only on a fundamental right of privacy but on the right to life itself."" Brief 27.
The appellants recognize that a century ago medical knowledge was not so advanced as it is today, that the techniques of antisepsis were not known, and that any abortion procedure was dangerous for the woman. To restrict the legality of the abortion to the situation where it was deemed necessary, in medical judgment, for the preservation of the woman's life was only a natural conclusion in the exercise of the legislative judgment of that time. A State is not to be reproached, however, for a past judgmental determination made in the light of then-existing medical knowledge. It is perhaps unfair to argue, as the appellants do, that because the early focus *191 was on the preservation of the woman's life, the State's present professed interest in the protection of embryonic and fetal life is to be downgraded. That argument denies the State the right to readjust its views and emphases in the light of the advanced knowledge and techniques of the day.
C. Appellants argue that § 26-1202 (a) of the Georgia statutes, as it has been left by the District Court's decision, is unconstitutionally vague. This argument centers on the proposition that, with the District Court's having struck down the statutorily specified reasons, it still remains a crime for a physician to perform an abortion except when, as § 26-1202 (a) reads, it is ""based upon his best clinical judgment that an abortion is necessary."" The appellants contend that the word ""necessary"" does not warn the physician of what conduct is proscribed; that the statute is wholly without objective standards and is subject to diverse interpretation; and that doctors will choose to err on the side of caution and will be arbitrary.
The net result of the District Court's decision is that the abortion determination, so far as the physician is concerned, is made in the exercise of his professional, that is, his ""best clinical,"" judgment in the light of all the attendant circumstances. He is not now restricted to the three situations originally specified. Instead, he may range farther afield wherever his medical judgment, properly and professionally exercised, so dictates and directs him.
The vagueness argument is set at rest by the decision in United States v. Vuitch, 402 U.S. 62, 71-72 (1971), where the issue was raised with respect to a District of Columbia statute making abortions criminal ""unless the same were done as necessary for the preservation of the mother's life or health and under the direction of a competent licensed practitioner of medicine."" That statute has been construed to bear upon psychological as *192 well as physical well-being. This being so, the Court concluded that the term ""health"" presented no problem of vagueness. ""Indeed, whether a particular operation is necessary for a patient's physical or mental health is a judgment that physicians are obviously called upon to make routinely whenever surgery is considered."" Id., at 72. This conclusion is equally applicable here. Whether, in the words of the Georgia statute, ""an abortion is necessary"" is a professional judgment that the Georgia physician will be called upon to make routinely.
We agree with the District Court, 319 F. Supp., at 1058, that the medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factorsphysical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's agerelevant to the wellbeing of the patient. All these factors may relate to health. This allows the attending physician the room he needs to make his best medical judgment. And it is room that operates for the benefit, not the disadvantage, of the pregnant woman.
D. The appellants next argue that the District Court should have declared unconstitutional three procedural demands of the Georgia statute: (1) that the abortion be performed in a hospital accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals:[11] (2) that the procedure be approved by the hospital staff abortion committee; and (3) that the performing physician's judgment be confirmed by the independent examinations of the patient by two other licensed physicians. The appellants attack these provisions not only on the ground that they unduly restrict the woman's right of privacy, but also on procedural due process and equal protection grounds. The physician-appellants also argue that, by subjecting a doctor's individual medical judgment to *193 committee approval and to confirming consultations, the statute impermissibly restricts the physician's right to practice his profession and deprives him of due process.
1. JCAH accreditation. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals is an organization without governmental sponsorship or overtones. No question whatever is raised concerning the integrity of the organization or the high purpose of the accreditation process.[12] That process, however, has to do with hospital standards generally and has no present particularized concern with abortion as a medical or surgical procedure.[13] In Georgia, there is no restriction on the performance of non-abortion surgery in a hospital not yet accredited by the JCAH so long as other requirements imposed by the State, such as licensing of the hospital and of the operating surgeon, are met. See Georgia Code §§ 88-1901 (a) *194 and 88-1905 (1971) and 84-907 (Supp. 1971). Furthermore, accreditation by the Commission is not granted until a hospital has been in operation at least one year. The Model Penal Code, § 230.3, Appendix B hereto, contains no requirement for JCAH accreditation. And the Uniform Abortion Act (Final Draft, Aug. 1971),[14] approved by the American Bar Association in February 1972, contains no JCAH-accredited hospital specification.[15] Some courts have held that a JCAH-accreditation requirement is an overbroad infringement of fundamental rights because it does not relate to the particular medical problems and dangers of the abortion operation. E. g., Poe v. Menghini, 339 F. Supp., at 993-994.
We hold that the JCAH-accreditation requirement does not withstand constitutional scrutiny in the present context. It is a requirement that simply is not ""based on differences that are reasonably related to the purposes of the Act in which it is found."" Morey v. Doud, 354 U.S. 457, 465 (1957).
This is not to say that Georgia may not or should not, from and after the end of the first trimester, adopt *195 standards for licensing all facilities where abortions may be performed so long as those standards are legitimately related to the objective the State seeks to accomplish. The appellants contend that such a relationship would be lacking even in a lesser requirement that an abortion be performed in a licensed hospital, as opposed to a facility, such as a clinic, that may be required by the State to possess all the staffing and services necessary to perform an abortion safely (including those adequate to handle serious complications or other emergency, or arrangements with a nearby hospital to provide such services). Appellants and various amici have presented us with a mass of data purporting to demonstrate that some facilities other than hospitals are entirely adequate to perform abortions if they possess these qualifications. The State, on the other hand, has not presented persuasive data to show that only hospitals meet its acknowledged interest in insuring the quality of the operation and the full protection of the patient. We feel compelled to agree with appellants that the State must show more than it has in order to prove that only the full resources of a licensed hospital, rather than those of some other appropriately licensed institution, satisfy these health interests. We hold that the hospital requirement of the Georgia law, because it fails to exclude the first trimester of pregnancy, see Roe v. Wade, ante, at 163, is also invalid. In so holding we naturally express no opinion on the medical judgment involved in any particular case, that is, whether the patient's situation is such that an abortion should be performed in a hospital, rather than in some other facility.
2. Committee approval. The second aspect of the appellants' procedural attack relates to the hospital abortion committee and to the pregnant woman's asserted *196 lack of access to that committee. Relying primarily on Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970), concerning the termination of welfare benefits, and Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433 (1971), concerning the posting of an alcoholic's name, Doe first argues that she was denied due process because she could not make a presentation to the committee. It is not clear from the record, however, whether Doe's own consulting physician was or was not a member of the committee or did or did not present her case, or, indeed, whether she herself was or was not there. We see nothing in the Georgia statute that explicitly denies access to the committee by or on behalf of the woman. If the access point alone were involved, we would not be persuaded to strike down the committee provision on the unsupported assumption that access is not provided.
Appellants attack the discretion the statute leaves to the committee. The most concrete argument they advance is their suggestion that it is still a badge of infamy ""in many minds"" to bear an illegitimate child, and that the Georgia system enables the committee members' personal views as to extramarital sex relations, and punishment therefor, to govern their decisions. This approach obviously is one founded on suspicion and one that discloses a lack of confidence in the integrity of physicians. To say that physicians will be guided in their hospital committee decisions by their predilections on extramarital sex unduly narrows the issue to pregnancy outside marriage. (Doe's own situation did not involve extramarital sex and its product.) The appellants' suggestion is necessarily somewhat degrading to the conscientious physician, particularly the obstetrician, whose professional activity is concerned with the physical and mental welfare, the woes, the emotions, and the concern of his female patients. He, perhaps more than anyone else, is knowledgeable in this area of patient care, and he is aware of human frailty, *197 so-called ""error,"" and needs. The good physiciandespite the presence of rascals in the medical profession, as in all others, we trust that most physicians are ""good"" will have sympathy and understanding for the pregnant patient that probably are not exceeded by those who participate in other areas of professional counselling.
It is perhaps worth noting that the abortion committee has a function of its own. It is a committee of the hospital and it is composed of members of the institution's medical staff. The membership usually is a changing one. In this way, its work burden is shared and is more readily accepted. The committee's function is protective. It enables the hospital appropriately to be advised that its posture and activities are in accord with legal requirements. It is to be remembered that the hospital is an entity and that it, too, has legal rights and legal obligations.
Saying all this, however, does not settle the issue of the constitutional propriety of the committee requirement. Viewing the Georgia statute as a whole, we see no constitutionally justifiable pertinence in the structure for the advance approval by the abortion committee. With regard to the protection of potential life, the medical judgment is already completed prior to the committee stage, and review by a committee once removed from diagnosis is basically redundant. We are not cited to any other surgical procedure made subject to committee approval as a matter of state criminal law. The woman's right to receive medical care in accordance with her licensed physician's best judgment and the physician's right to administer it are substantially limited by this statutorily imposed overview. And the hospital itself is otherwise fully protected. Under § 26-1202 (e), the hospital is free not to admit a patient for an abortion. It is even free not to have an abortion committee. Further, a physician or any other employee has the right to refrain, *198 for moral or religious reasons, from participating in the abortion procedure. These provisions obviously are in the statute in order to afford appropriate protection to the individual and to the denominational hospital. Section 26-1202 (e) affords adequate protection to the hospital, and little more is provided by the committee prescribed by § 26-1202 (b) (5).
We conclude that the interposition of the hospital abortion committee is unduly restrictive of the patient's rights and needs that, at this point, have already been medically delineated and substantiated by her personal physician. To ask more serves neither the hospital nor the State.
3. Two-doctor concurrence. The third aspect of the appellants' attack centers on the ""time and availability of adequate medical facilities and personnel."" It is said that the system imposes substantial and irrational roadblocks and ""is patently unsuited"" to prompt determination of the abortion decision. Time, of course, is critical in abortion. Risks during the first trimester of pregnancy are admittedly lower than during later months.
The appellants purport to show by a local study[16] of Grady Memorial Hospital (serving indigent residents in Fulton and DeKalb Counties) that the ""mechanics of the system itself forced . . . discontinuance of the abortion process"" because the median time for the workup was 15 days. The same study shows, however, that 27% of the candidates for abortion were already 13 or more weeks pregnant at the time of application, that is, they were at the end of or beyond the first trimester when they made their applications. It is too much to say, as appellants do, that these particular persons ""were victims of a system over which they [had] no control."" If higher risk was incurred because of abortions in the *199 second rather than the first trimester, much of that risk was due to delay in application, and not to the alleged cumbersomeness of the system. We note, in passing, that appellant Doe had no delay problem herself; the decision in her case was made well within the first trimester.
It should be manifest that our rejection of the accredited-hospital requirement and, more important, of the abortion committee's advance approval eliminates the major grounds of the attack based on the system's delay and the lack of facilities. There remains, however, the required confirmation by two Georgia-licensed physicians in addition to the recommendation of the pregnant woman's own consultant (making under the statute, a total of six physicians involved, including the three on the hospital's abortion committee). We conclude that this provision, too, must fall.
The statute's emphasis, as has been repetitively noted, is on the attending physician's ""best clinical judgment that an abortion is necessary."" That should be sufficient. The reasons for the presence of the confirmation step in the statute are perhaps apparent, but they are insufficient to withstand constitutional challenge. Again, no other voluntary medical or surgical procedure for which Georgia requires confirmation by two other physicians has been cited to us. If a physician is licensed by the State, he is recognized by the State as capable of exercising acceptable clinical judgment. If he fails in this, professional censure and deprivation of his license are available remedies. Required acquiescence by co-practitioners has no rational connection with a patient's needs and unduly infringes on the physician's right to practice. The attending physician will know when a consultation is advisable the doubtful situation, the need for assurance when the medical decision is a delicate one, and the like. Physicians have followed this routine historically and *200 know its usefulness and benefit for all concerned. It is still true today that ""[r]eliance must be placed upon the assurance given by his license, issued by an authority competent to judge in that respect, that he [the physician] possesses the requisite qualifications."" Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U.S. 114, 122-123 (1889). See United States v. Vuitch, 402 U. S., at 71.
E. The appellants attack the residency requirement of the Georgia law, §§ 26-1202 (b) (1) and (b) (2), as violative of the right to travel stressed in Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 629-631 (1969), and other cases. A requirement of this kind, of course, could be deemed to have some relationship to the availability of post-procedure medical care for the aborted patient.
Nevertheless, we do not uphold the constitutionality of the residence requirement. It is not based on any policy of preserving state-supported facilities for Georgia residents, for the bar also applies to private hospitals and to privately retained physicians. There is no intimation, either, that Georgia facilities are utilized to capacity in caring for Georgia residents. Just as the Privileges and Immunities Clause, Const. Art. IV, § 2, protects persons who enter other States to ply their trade, Ward v. Maryland, 12 Wall. 418, 430 (1871); Blake v. McClung, 172 U.S. 239, 248-256 (1898), so must it protect persons who enter Georgia seeking the medical services that are available there. See Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U.S. 385, 396-397 (1948). A contrary holding would mean that a State could limit to its own residents the general medical care available within its borders. This we could not approve.
F. The last argument on this phase of the case is one that often is made, namely, that the Georgia system is violative of equal protection because it discriminates against the poor. The appellants do not urge that abortions *201 should be performed by persons other than licensed physicians, so we have no argument that because the wealthy can better afford physicians, the poor should have non-physicians made available to them. The appellants acknowledged that the procedures are ""nondiscriminatory in . . . express terms"" but they suggest that they have produced invidious discriminations. The District Court rejected this approach out of hand. 319 F. Supp., at 1056. It rests primarily on the accreditation and approval and confirmation requirements, discussed above, and on the assertion that most of Georgia's counties have no accredited hospital. We have set aside the accreditation, approval, and confirmation requirements, however, and with that, the discrimination argument collapses in all significant aspects.

V
The appellants complain, finally, of the District Court's denial of injunctive relief. A like claim was made in Roe v. Wade, ante, p. 113. We declined decision there insofar as injunctive relief was concerned, and we decline it here. We assume that Georgia's prosecutorial authorities will give full recognition to the judgment of this Court.
In summary, we hold that the JCAH-accredited hospital provision and the requirements as to approval by the hospital abortion committee, as to confirmation by two independent physicians, and as to residence in Georgia are all violative of the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, the following portions of § 26-1202 (b), remaining after the District Court's judgment, are invalid:
(1) Subsections (1) and (2).
(2) That portion of Subsection (3) following the words ""[s]uch physician's judgment is reduced to writing.""
(3) Subsections (4) and (5).
*202 The judgment of the District Court is modified accordingly and, as so modified, is affirmed. Costs are allowed to the appellants.

APPENDIX A TO OPINION OF THE COURT

Criminal Code of Georgia

(The italicized portions are those held unconstitutional by the District Court)

CHAPTER 26-12. ABORTION.
26-1201. Criminal Abortion. Except as otherwise provided in section 26-1202, a person commits criminal abortion when he administers any medicine, drug or other substance whatever to any woman or when he uses any instrument or other means whatever upon any woman with intent to produce a miscarriage or abortion.
26-1202. Exception. (a) Section 26-1201 shall not apply to an abortion performed by a physician duly licensed to practice medicine and surgery pursuant to Chapter 84-9 or 84-12 of the Code of Georgia of 1933, as amended, based upon his best clinical judgment that an abortion is necessary because:
(1) A continuation of the pregnancy would endanger the life of the pregnant woman or would seriously and permanently injure her health; or
(2) The fetus would very likely be born with a grave, permanent, and irremediable mental or physical defect; or
(3) The pregnancy resulted from forcible or statutory rape.
(b) No abortion is authorized or shall be performed under this section unless each of the following conditions is met:
(1) The pregnant woman requesting the abortion certifies in writing under oath and subject to the penalties *203 of false swearing to the physician who proposes to perform the abortion that she is a bona fide legal resident of the State of Georgia.
(2) The physician certifies that he believes the woman is a bona fide resident of this State and that he has no information which should lead him to believe otherwise.
(3) Such physician's judgment is reduced to writing and concurred in by at least two other physicians duly licensed to practice medicine and surgery pursuant to Chapter 84-9 of the Code of Georgia of 1933, as amended, who certify in writing that based upon their separate personal medical examinations of the pregnant woman, the abortion is, in their judgment, necessary because of one or more of the reasons enumerated above.
(4) Such abortion is performed in a hospital licensed by the State Board of Health and accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals.
(5) The performance of the abortion has been approved in advance by a committee of the medical staff of the hospital in which the operation is to be performed. This committee must be one established and maintained in accordance with the standards promulgated by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospitals, and its approval must be by a majority vote of a membership of not less than three members of the hospital's staff; the physician proposing to perform the operation may not be counted as a member of the committee for this purpose.
(6) If the proposed abortion is considered necessary because the woman has been raped, the woman makes a written statement under oath, and subject to the penalties of false swearing, of the date, time and place of the rape and the name of the rapist, if known. There must be attached to this statement a certified copy of any report of the rape made by any law enforcement officer or agency and a statement by the solicitor general of the *204 judicial circuit where the rape occurred or allegedly occurred that, according to his best information, there is probable cause to believe that the rape did occur.
(7) Such written opinions, statements, certificates, and concurrences are maintained in the permanent files of such hospital and are available at all reasonable times to the solicitor general of the judicial circuit in which the hospital is located.
(8) A copy of such written opinions, statements, certificates, and concurrences is filed with the Director of the State Department of Public Health within 10 days after such operation is performed.
(9) All written opinions, statements, certificates, and concurrences filed and maintained pursuant to paragraphs (7) and (8) of this subsection shall be confidential records and shall not be made available for public inspection at any time.
(c) Any solicitor general of the judicial circuit in which an abortion is to be performed under this section, or any person who would be a relative of the child within the second degree of consanguinity, may petition the superior court of the county in which the abortion is to be performed for a declaratory judgment whether the performance of such abortion would violate any constitutional or other legal rights of the fetus. Such solicitor general may also petition such court for the purpose of taking issue with compliance with the requirements of this section. The physician who proposes to perform the abortion and the pregnant woman shall be respondents. The petition shall be heard expeditiously and if the court adjudges that such abortion would violate the constitutional or other legal rights of the fetus, the court shall so declare and shall restrain the physician from performing the abortion.
(d) If an abortion is performed in compliance with this section, the death of the fetus shall not give rise to any claim for wrongful death.
*205 (e) Nothing in this section shall require a hospital to admit any patient under the provisions hereof for the purpose of performing an abortion, nor shall any hospital be required to appoint a committee such as contemplated under subsection (b) (5). A physician, or any other person who is a member of or associated with the staff of a hospital, or any employee of a hospital in which an abortion has been authorized, who shall state in writing an objection to such abortion on moral or religious grounds shall not be required to participate in the medical procedures which will result in the abortion, and the refusal of any such person to participate therein shall not form the basis of any claim for damages on account of such refusal or for any disciplinary or recriminatory action against such person.
26-1203. Punishment. A person convicted of criminal abortion shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than one nor more than 10 years.

APPENDIX B TO OPINION OF THE COURT

American Law Institute

MODEL PENAL CODE
Section 230.3. Abortion.
(1) Unjustified Abortion. A person who purposely and unjustifiably terminates the pregnancy of another otherwise than by a live birth commits a felony of the third degree or, where the pregnancy has continued beyond the twenty-sixth week, a felony of the second degree.
(2) Justifiable Abortion. A licensed physician is justified in terminating a pregnancy if he believes there is substantial risk that continuance of the pregnancy would gravely impair the physical or mental health of the mother or that the child would be born with grave physical or mental defect, or that the pregnancy resulted from rape, incest, or other felonious intercourse. All *206 illicit intercourse with a girl below the age of 16 shall be deemed felonious for purposes of this subsection. Justifiable abortions shall be performed only in a licensed hospital except in case of emergency when hospital facilities are unavailable. [Additional exceptions from the requirement of hospitalization may be incorporated here to take account of situations in sparsely settled areas where hospitals are not generally accessible.]
(3) Physicians' Certificates; Presumption from Non-Compliance. No abortion shall be performed unless two physicians, one of whom may be the person performing the abortion, shall have certified in writing the circumstances which they believe to justify the abortion. Such certificate shall be submitted before the abortion to the hospital where it is to be performed and, in the case of abortion following felonious intercourse, to the prosecuting attorney or the police. Failure to comply with any of the requirements of this Subsection gives rise to a presumption that the abortion was unjustified.
(4) Self-Abortion. A woman whose pregnancy has continued beyond the twenty-sixth week commits a felony of the third degree if she purposely terminates her own pregnancy otherwise than by a live birth, or if she uses instruments, drugs or violence upon herself for that purpose. Except as justified under Subsection (2), a person who induces or knowingly aids a woman to use instruments, drugs or violence upon herself for the purpose of terminating her pregnancy otherwise than by a live birth commits a felony of the third degree whether or not the pregnancy has continued beyond the twenty-sixth week.
(5) Pretended Abortion. A person commits a felony of the third degree if, representing that it is his purpose to perform an abortion, he does an act adapted to cause abortion in a pregnant woman although the woman is in fact not pregnant, or the actor does not believe she is. *207 A person charged with unjustified abortion under Sub-section (1) or an attempt to commit that offense may be convicted thereof upon proof of conduct prohibited by this Subsection.
(6) Distribution of Abortifacients. A person who sells, offers to sell, possesses with intent to sell, advertises, or displays for sale anything specially designed to terminate a pregnancy, or held out by the actor as useful for that purpose, commits a misdemeanor, unless:
(a) the sale, offer or display is to a physician or druggist or to an intermediary in a chain of distribution to physicians or druggists; or
(b) the sale is made upon prescription or order of a physician; or
(c) the possession is with intent to sell as authorized in paragraphs (a) and (b); or
(d) the advertising is addressed to persons named in paragraph (a) and confined to trade or professional channels not likely to reach the general public.
(7) Section Inapplicable to Prevention of Pregnancy. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed applicable to the prescription, administration or distribution of drugs or other substances for avoiding pregnancy, whether by preventing implantation of a fertilized ovum or by any other method that operates before, at or immediately after fertilization.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, concurring[*]
I agree that, under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the abortion statutes of Georgia and Texas impermissibly limit the performance of abortions necessary to protect the health of pregnant women, using *208 the term health in its broadest medical context. See United States v. Vuitch, 402 U.S. 62, 71-72 (1971). I am somewhat troubled that the Court has taken notice of various scientific and medical data in reaching its conclusion; however, I do not believe that the Court has exceeded the scope of judicial notice accepted in other contexts.
In oral argument, counsel for the State of Texas informed the Court that early abortion procedures were routinely permitted in certain exceptional cases, such as nonconsensual pregnancies resulting from rape and incest. In the face of a rigid and narrow statute, such as that of Texas, no one in these circumstances should be placed in a posture of dependence on a prosecutorial policy or prosecutorial discretion. Of course, States must have broad power, within the limits indicated in the opinions, to regulate the subject of abortions, but where the consequences of state intervention are so severe, uncertainty must be avoided as much as possible. For my part, I would be inclined to allow a State to require the certification of two physicians to support an abortion, but the Court holds otherwise. I do not believe that such a procedure is unduly burdensome, as are the complex steps of the Georgia statute, which require as many as six doctors and the use of a hospital certified by the JCAH.
I do not read the Court's holdings today as having the sweeping consequences attributed to them by the dissenting Justices; the dissenting views discount the reality that the vast majority of physicians observe the standards of their profession, and act only on the basis of carefully deliberated medical judgments relating to life and health. Plainly, the Court today rejects any claim that the Constitution requires abortions on demand.
*209 MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring[*]
While I join the opinion of the Court,[1] I add a few words.

I
The questions presented in the present cases go far beyond the issues of vagueness, which we considered in United States v. Vuitch, 402 U.S. 62. They involve the right of privacy, one aspect of which we considered in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 484, when we held that various guarantees in the Bill of Rights create zones of privacy.[2]
*210 The Griswold case involved a law forbidding the use of contraceptives. We held that law as applied to married people unconstitutional:
""We deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rightsolder than our political parties, older than our school system. Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred."" Id., at 486.
The District Court in Doe held that Griswold and related cases ""establish a Constitutional right to privacy broad enough to encompass the right of a woman to terminate an unwanted pregnancy in its early stages, by obtaining an abortion."" 319 F. Supp. 1048, 1054.
The Supreme Court of California expressed the same view in People v. Belous,[3] 71 Cal. 2d 954, 963, 458 P.2d 194, 199.
The Ninth Amendment obviously does not create federally enforceable rights. It merely says, ""The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."" But a catalogue of these rights includes customary, traditional, and time-honored rights, amenities, privileges, and immunities that come within the sweep of ""the Blessings of Liberty"" mentioned in the preamble to the Constitution. Many of them, in my view, come *211 within the meaning of the term ""liberty"" as used in the Fourteenth Amendment.
First is the autonomous control over the development and expression of one's intellect, interests, tastes, and personality.
These are rights protected by the First Amendment and, in my view, they are absolute, permitting of no exceptions. See Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1; Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 508 (dissent); Kingsley Pictures Corp. v. Regents, 360 U.S. 684, 697 (concurring); New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 293 (Black, J., concurring, in which I joined). The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment is one facet of this constitutional right. The right to remain silent as respects one's own beliefs, Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 196-199, is protected by the First and the Fifth. The First Amendment grants the privacy of first-class mail, United States v. Van Leeuwen, 397 U.S. 249, 253. All of these aspects of the right of privacy are rights ""retained by the people"" in the meaning of the Ninth Amendment.
Second is freedom of choice in the basic decisions of one's life respecting marriage, divorce, procreation, contraception, and the education and upbringing of children.
These rights, unlike those protected by the First Amendment, are subject to some control by the police power. Thus, the Fourth Amendment speaks only of ""unreasonable searches and seizures"" and of ""probable cause."" These rights are ""fundamental,"" and we have held that in order to support legislative action the statute must be narrowly and precisely drawn and that a ""compelling state interest"" must be shown in support of the limitation. E. g., Kramer v. Union Free School District, 395 U.S. 621; Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618; *212 Carrington v. Rash, 380 U.S. 89; Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398; NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449.
The liberty to marry a person of one's own choosing, Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1; the right of procreation, Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535; the liberty to direct the education of one's children, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, and the privacy of the marital relation, Griswold v. Connecticut, supra, are in this category.[4]*213 Only last Term in Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, another contraceptive case, we expanded the concept of Griswold by saying:
""It is true that in Griswold the right of privacy in question inhered in the marital relationship. Yet the marital couple is not an independent entity with a mind and heart of its own, but an association of two individuals each with a separate intellectual and emotional makeup. If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child."" Id., at 453.
This right of privacy was called by Mr. Justice Brandeis the right ""to be let alone."" Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478 (dissenting opinion). That right includes the privilege of an individual to plan his own affairs, for, "" `outside areas of plainly harmful conduct, every American is left to shape his own life as he thinks best, do what he pleases, go where he pleases.' "" Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116, 126.
Third is the freedom to care for one's health and person, freedom from bodily restraint or compulsion, freedom to walk, stroll, or loaf.
These rights, though fundamental, are likewise subject to regulation on a showing of ""compelling state interest."" We stated in Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 164, that walking, strolling, and wandering ""are historically part of the amenities of life as we have known them."" As stated in Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 29:
""There is, of course, a sphere within which the individual may assert the supremacy of his own will *214 and rightfully dispute the authority of any human government, especially of any free government existing under a written constitution, to interfere with the exercise of that will.""
In Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U.S. 250, 252, the Court said, ""The inviolability of the person is as much invaded by a compulsory stripping and exposure as by a blow.""
In Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 8-9, the Court, in speaking of the Fourth Amendment stated, ""This inestimable right of personal security belongs as much to the citizen on the streets of our cities as to the homeowner closeted in his study to dispose of his secret affairs.""
Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 350, emphasizes that the Fourth Amendment ""protects individual privacy against certain kinds of governmental intrusion.""
In Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399, the Court said:
""Without doubt, [liberty] denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.""
The Georgia statute is at war with the clear message of these casesthat a woman is free to make the basic decision whether to bear an unwanted child. Elaborate argument is hardly necessary to demonstrate that childbirth may deprive a woman of her preferred lifestyle and force upon her a radically different and undesired future. For example, rejected applicants under the Georgia statute are required to endure the *215 discomforts of pregnancy; to incur the pain, higher mortality rate, and aftereffects of childbirth; to abandon educational plans; to sustain loss of income; to forgo the satisfactions of careers; to tax further mental and physical health in providing child care; and, in some cases, to bear the lifelong stigma of unwed motherhood, a badge which may haunt, if not deter, later legitimate family relationships.

II
Such reasoning is, however, only the beginning of the problem. The State has interests to protect. Vaccinations to prevent epidemics are one example, as Jacobson, supra, holds. The Court held that compulsory sterilization of imbeciles afflicted with hereditary forms of insanity or imbecility is another. Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200. Abortion affects another. While childbirth endangers the lives of some women, voluntary abortion at any time and place regardless of medical standards would impinge on a rightful concern of society. The woman's health is part of that concern; as is the life of the fetus after quickening. These concerns justify the State in treating the procedure as a medical one.
One difficulty is that this statute as construed and applied apparently does not give full sweep to the ""psychological as well as physical well-being"" of women patients which saved the concept ""health"" from being void for vagueness in United States v. Vuitch, 402 U. S., at 72. But, apart from that, Georgia's enactment has a constitutional infirmity because, as stated by the District Court, it ""limits the number of reasons for which an abortion may be sought."" I agree with the holding of the District Court, ""This the State may not do, because such action unduly restricts a decision sheltered by the Constitutional right to privacy."" 319 F. Supp., at 1056.
The vicissitudes of life produce pregnancies which may be unwanted, or which may impair ""health"" in *216 the broad Vuitch sense of the term, or which may imperil the life of the mother, or which in the full setting of the case may create such suffering, dislocations, misery, or tragedy as to make an early abortion the only civilized step to take. These hardships may be properly embraced in the ""health"" factor of the mother as appraised by a person of insight. Or they may be part of a broader medical judgment based on what is ""appropriate"" in a given case, though perhaps not ""necessary"" in a strict sense.
The ""liberty"" of the mother, though rooted as it is in the Constitution, may be qualified by the State for the reasons we have stated. But where fundamental personal rights and liberties are involved, the corrective legislation must be ""narrowly drawn to prevent the supposed evil,"" Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 307, and not be dealt with in an ""unlimited and indiscriminate"" manner. Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 490. And see Talley v. California, 362 U.S. 60. Unless regulatory measures are so confined and are addressed to the specific areas of compelling legislative concern, the police power would become the great leveler of constitutional rights and liberties.
There is no doubt that the State may require abortions to be performed by qualified medical personnel. The legitimate objective of preserving the mother's health clearly supports such laws. Their impact upon the woman's privacy is minimal. But the Georgia statute outlaws virtually all such operationseven in the earliest stages of pregnancy. In light of modern medical evidence suggesting that an early abortion is safer healthwise than childbirth itself,[5] it cannot be seriously *217 urged that so comprehensive a ban is aimed at protecting the woman's health. Rather, this expansive proscription of all abortions along the temporal spectrum can rest only on a public goal of preserving both embryonic and fetal life.
The present statute has struck the balance between the woman's and the State's interests wholly in favor of the latter. I am not prepared to hold that a State may equate, as Georgia has done, all phases of maturation preceding birth. We held in Griswold that the States may not preclude spouses from attempting to avoid the joinder of sperm and egg. If this is true, it is difficult to perceive any overriding public necessity which might attach precisely at the moment of conception. As Mr. Justice Clark has said:[6]
""To say that life is present at conception is to give recognition to the potential, rather than the actual. The unfertilized egg has life, and if fertilized, it takes on human proportions. But the law deals in reality, not obscuritythe known rather than the unknown. When sperm meets egg life may eventually form, but quite often it does not. The law does not deal in speculation. The phenomenon of *218 life takes time to develop, and until it is actually present, it cannot be destroyed. Its interruption prior to formation would hardly be homicide, and as we have seen, society does not regard it as such. The rites of Baptism are not performed and death certificates are not required when a miscarriage occurs. No prosecutor has ever returned a murder indictment charging the taking of the life of a fetus.[7] This would not be the case if the fetus constituted human life.""
In summary, the enactment is overbroad. It is not closely correlated to the aim of preserving prenatal life. In fact, it permits its destruction in several cases, including pregnancies resulting from sex acts in which unmarried females are below the statutory age of consent. At the same time, however, the measure broadly proscribes aborting other pregnancies which may cause severe mental disorders. Additionally, the statute is overbroad because it equates the value of embryonic life immediately after conception with the worth of life immediately before birth.

III
Under the Georgia Act, the mother's physician is not the sole judge as to whether the abortion should be performed. Two other licensed physicians must concur in his judgment.[8] Moreover, the abortion must be performed in a licensed hospital;[9] and the abortion must be *219 approved in advance by a committee of the medical staff of that hospital.[10]
Physicians, who speak to us in Doe through an amicus brief, complain of the Georgia Act's interference with their practice of their profession.
The right of privacy has no more conspicuous place than in the physician-patient relationship, unless it be in the priest-penitent relationship.
It is one thing for a patient to agree that her physician may consult with another physician about her case. It is quite a different matter for the State compulsorily to impose on that physician-patient relationship another layer or, as in this case, still a third layer of physicians. The right of privacythe right to care for one's health and person and to seek out a physician of one's own choice protected by the Fourteenth Amendmentbecomes only a matter of theory, not a reality, when a multiple-physician-approval system is mandated by the State.
The State licenses a physician. If he is derelict or faithless, the procedures available to punish him or to deprive him of his license are well known. He is entitled to procedural due process before professional disciplinary sanctions may be imposed. See In re Ruffalo, 390 U.S. 544. Crucial here, however, is state-imposed control over the medical decision whether pregnancy should be interrupted. The good-faith decision of the patient's chosen physician is overridden and the final decision passed on to others in whose selection the patient has no part. This is a total destruction of the right of privacy between physician and patient and the intimacy of relation which that entails.
The right to seek advice on one's health and the right to place reliance on the physician of one's choice are *220 basic to Fourteenth Amendment values. We deal with fundamental rights and liberties, which, as already noted, can be contained or controlled only by discretely drawn legislation that preserves the ""liberty"" and regulates only those phases of the problem of compelling legislative concern. The imposition by the State of group controls over the physician-patient relationship is not made on any medical procedure apart from abortion, no matter how dangerous the medical step may be. The oversight imposed on the physician and patient in abortion cases denies them their ""liberty,"" viz., their right of privacy, without any compelling, discernible state interest.
Georgia has constitutional warrant in treating abortion as a medical problem. To protect the woman's right of privacy, however, the control must be through the physician of her choice and the standards set for his performance.
The protection of the fetus when it has acquired life is a legitimate concern of the State. Georgia's law makes no rational, discernible decision on that score.[11] For under the Code, the developmental stage of the fetus is irrelevant when pregnancy is the result of rape, when the fetus will very likely be born with a permanent defect, or when a continuation of the pregnancy will endanger the life of the mother or permanently injure her health. When life is present is a question we do not try to resolve. While basically a question for medical experts, as stated by Mr. Justice Clark,[12] it is, of course, caught up in matters of religion and morality.
In short, I agree with the Court that endangering the life of the woman or seriously and permanently injuring *221 her health are standards too narrow for the right of privacy that is at stake.
I also agree that the superstructure of medical supervision which Georgia has erected violates the patient's right of privacy inherent in her choice of her own physician.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, with whom MR."
14892,Justice White,dissenting,False,Doe v. Bolton,,1973,2.0,"[*]
At the heart of the controversy in these cases are those recurring pregnancies that pose no danger whatsoever to the life or health of the mother but are, nevertheless, unwanted for any one or more of a variety of reasons convenience, family planning, economics, dislike of children, the embarrassment of illegitimacy, etc. The common claim before us is that for any one of such reasons, or for no reason at all, and without asserting or claiming any threat to life or health, any woman is entitled to an abortion at her request if she is able to find a medical advisor willing to undertake the procedure.
The Court for the most part sustains this position: During the period prior to the time the fetus becomes viable, the Constitution of the United States values the convenience, whim, or caprice of the putative mother more than the life or potential life of the fetus; the Constitution, therefore, guarantees the right to an abortion as against any state law or policy seeking to protect the fetus from an abortion not prompted by more compelling reasons of the mother.
With all due respect, I dissent. I find nothing in the language or history of the Constitution to support the Court's judgment. The Court simply fashions and announces a new constitutional right for pregnant mothers *222 and, with scarcely any reason or authority for its action, invests that right with sufficient substance to override most existing state abortion statutes. The upshot is that the people and the legislatures of the 50 States are constitutionally disentitled to weigh the relative importance of the continued existence and development of the fetus, on the one hand, against a spectrum of possible impacts on the mother, on the other hand. As an exercise of raw judicial power, the Court perhaps has authority to do what it does today; but in my view its judgment is an improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review that the Constitution extends to this Court.
The Court apparently values the convenience of the pregnant mother more than the continued existence and development of the life or potential life that she carries. Whether or not I might agree with that marshaling of values, I can in no event join the Court's judgment because I find no constitutional warrant for imposing such an order of priorities on the people and legislatures of the States. In a sensitive area such as this, involving as it does issues over which reasonable men may easily and heatedly differ, I cannot accept the Court's exercise of its clear power of choice by interposing a constitutional barrier to state efforts to protect human life and by investing mothers and doctors with the constitutionally protected right to exterminate it. This issue, for the most part, should be left with the people and to the political processes the people have devised to govern their affairs.
It is my view, therefore, that the Texas statute is not constitutionally infirm because it denies abortions to those who seek to serve only their convenience rather than to protect their life or health. Nor is this plaintiff, who claims no threat to her mental or physical health, entitled to assert the possible rights of those women *223 whose pregnancy assertedly implicates their health. This, together with United States v. Vuitch, 402 U.S. 62 (1971), dictates reversal of the judgment of the District Court.
Likewise, because Georgia may constitutionally forbid abortions to putative mothers who, like the plaintiff in this case, do not fall within the reach of § 26-1202 (a) of its criminal code, I have no occasion, and the District Court had none, to consider the constitutionality of the procedural requirements of the Georgia statute as applied to those pregnancies posing substantial hazards to either life or health. I would reverse the judgment of the District Court in the Georgia case.
MR."
14893,Justice Rehnquist,second_dissenting,False,Doe v. Bolton,,1973,2.0,"The holding in Roe v. Wade, ante, p. 113, that state abortion laws can withstand constitutional scrutiny only if the State can demonstrate a compelling state interest, apparently compels the Court's close scrutiny of the various provisions in Georgia's abortion statute. Since, as indicated by my dissent in Wade, I view the compelling-state-interest standard as an inappropriate measure of the constitutionality of state abortion laws, I respectfully dissent from the majority's holding.
"
763,Justice Blackmun,majority,False,Roe v. Wade,,1973,2.0,"This Texas federal appeal and its Georgia companion, Doe v. Bolton, post, p. 179, present constitutional challenges to state criminal abortion legislation. The Texas statutes under attack here are typical of those that have been in effect in many States for approximately a century. The Georgia statutes, in contrast, have a modern cast and are a legislative product that, to an extent at least, obviously reflects the influences of recent attitudinal change, of advancing medical knowledge and techniques, and of new thinking about an old issue.
We forthwith acknowledge our awareness of the sensitive and emotional nature of the abortion controversy, of the vigorous opposing views, even among physicians, and of the deep and seemingly absolute convictions that the subject inspires. One's philosophy, one's experiences, one's exposure to the raw edges of human existence, one's religious training, one's attitudes toward life and family and their values, and the moral standards one establishes and seeks to observe, are all likely to influence and to color one's thinking and conclusions about abortion.
In addition, population growth, pollution, poverty, and racial overtones tend to complicate and not to simplify the problem.
Our task, of course, is to resolve the issue by constitutional measurement, free of emotion and of predilection. We seek earnestly to do this, and, because we do, we *117 have inquired into, and in this opinion place some emphasis upon, medical and medical-legal history and what that history reveals about man's attitudes toward the abortion procedure over the centuries. We bear in mind, too, Mr. Justice Holmes' admonition in his nowvindicated dissent in Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 76 (1905):
""[The Constitution] is made for people of fundamentally differing views, and the accident of our finding certain opinions natural and familiar or novel and even shocking ought not to conclude our judgment upon the question whether statutes embodying them conflict with the Constitution of the United States.""

I
The Texas statutes that concern us here are Arts. 1191-1194 and 1196 of the State's Penal Code.[1] These make it a crime to ""procure an abortion,"" as therein *118 defined, or to attempt one, except with respect to ""an abortion procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother."" Similar statutes are in existence in a majority of the States.[2]
*119 Texas first enacted a criminal abortion statute in 1854. Texas Laws 1854, c. 49, § 1, set forth in 3 H. Gammel, Laws of Texas 1502 (1898). This was soon modified into language that has remained substantially unchanged to the present time. See Texas Penal Code of 1857, c. 7, Arts. 531-536; G. Paschal, Laws of Texas, Arts. 2192-2197 (1866); Texas Rev. Stat., c. 8, Arts. 536-541 (1879); Texas Rev. Crim. Stat., Arts. 1071-1076 (1911). The final article in each of these compilations provided the same exception, as does the present Article 1196, for an abortion by ""medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother.""[3]


*120 II
Jane Roe,[4] a single woman who was residing in Dallas County, Texas, instituted this federal action in March 1970 against the District Attorney of the county. She sought a declaratory judgment that the Texas criminal abortion statutes were unconstitutional on their face, and an injunction restraining the defendant from enforcing the statutes.
Roe alleged that she was unmarried and pregnant; that she wished to terminate her pregnancy by an abortion ""performed by a competent, licensed physician, under safe, clinical conditions""; that she was unable to get a ""legal"" abortion in Texas because her life did not appear to be threatened by the continuation of her pregnancy; and that she could not afford to travel to another jurisdiction in order to secure a legal abortion under safe conditions. She claimed that the Texas statutes were unconstitutionally vague and that they abridged her right of personal privacy, protected by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. By an amendment to her complaint Roe purported to sue ""on behalf of herself and all other women"" similarly situated.
James Hubert Hallford, a licensed physician, sought and was granted leave to intervene in Roe's action. In his complaint he alleged that he had been arrested previously for violations of the Texas abortion statutes and *121 that two such prosecutions were pending against him. He described conditions of patients who came to him seeking abortions, and he claimed that for many cases he, as a physician, was unable to determine whether they fell within or outside the exception recognized by Article 1196. He alleged that, as a consequence, the statutes were vague and uncertain, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that they violated his own and his patients' rights to privacy in the doctor-patient relationship and his own right to practice medicine, rights he claimed were guaranteed by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments.
John and Mary Doe,[5] a married couple, filed a companion complaint to that of Roe. They also named the District Attorney as defendant, claimed like constitutional deprivations, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The Does alleged that they were a childless couple; that Mrs. Doe was suffering from a ""neural-chemical"" disorder; that her physician had ""advised her to avoid pregnancy until such time as her condition has materially improved"" (although a pregnancy at the present time would not present ""a serious risk"" to her life); that, pursuant to medical advice, she had discontinued use of birth control pills; and that if she should become pregnant, she would want to terminate the pregnancy by an abortion performed by a competent, licensed physician under safe, clinical conditions. By an amendment to their complaint, the Does purported to sue ""on behalf of themselves and all couples similarly situated.""
The two actions were consolidated and heard together by a duly convened three-judge district court. The suits thus presented the situations of the pregnant single woman, the childless couple, with the wife not pregnant, *122 and the licensed practicing physician, all joining in the attack on the Texas criminal abortion statutes. Upon the filing of affidavits, motions were made for dismissal and for summary judgment. The court held that Roe and members of her class, and Dr. Hallford, had standing to sue and presented justiciable controversies, but that the Does had failed to allege facts sufficient to state a present controversy and did not have standing. It concluded that, with respect to the requests for a declaratory judgment, abstention was not warranted. On the merits, the District Court held that the ""fundamental right of single women and married persons to choose whether to have children is protected by the Ninth Amendment, through the Fourteenth Amendment,"" and that the Texas criminal abortion statutes were void on their face because they were both unconstitutionally vague and constituted an overbroad infringement of the plaintiffs' Ninth Amendment rights. The court then held that abstention was warranted with respect to the requests for an injunction. It therefore dismissed the Does' complaint, declared the abortion statutes void, and dismissed the application for injunctive relief. 314 F. Supp. 1217, 1225 (ND Tex. 1970).
The plaintiffs Roe and Doe and the intervenor Hallford, pursuant to 28 U.S. C. § 1253, have appealed to this Court from that part of the District Court's judgment denying the injunction. The defendant District Attorney has purported to cross-appeal, pursuant to the same statute, from the court's grant of declaratory relief to Roe and Hallford. Both sides also have taken protective appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. That court ordered the appeals held in abeyance pending decision here. We postponed decision on jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits. 402 U.S. 941 (1971).


*123 III
It might have been preferable if the defendant, pursuant to our Rule 20, had presented to us a petition for certiorari before judgment in the Court of Appeals with respect to the granting of the plaintiffs' prayer for declaratory relief. Our decisions in Mitchell v. Donovan, 398 U.S. 427 (1970), and Gunn v. University Committee, 399 U.S. 383 (1970), are to the effect that § 1253 does not authorize an appeal to this Court from the grant or denial of declaratory relief alone. We conclude, nevertheless, that those decisions do not foreclose our review of both the injunctive and the declaratory aspects of a case of this kind when it is properly here, as this one is, on appeal under § 1253 from specific denial of injunctive relief, and the arguments as to both aspects are necessarily identical. See Carter v. Jury Comm'n, 396 U.S. 320 (1970); Florida Lime Growers v. Jacobsen, 362 U.S. 73, 80-81 (1960). It would be destructive of time and energy for all concerned were we to rule otherwise. Cf. Doe v. Bolton, post, p. 179.

IV
We are next confronted with issues of justiciability, standing, and abstention. Have Roe and the Does established that ""personal stake in the outcome of the controversy,"" Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962), that insures that ""the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution,"" Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 101 (1968), and Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 732 (1972)? And what effect did the pendency of criminal abortion charges against Dr. Hallford in state court have upon the propriety of the federal court's granting relief to him as a plaintiff-intervenor?
*124 A. Jane Roe. Despite the use of the pseudonym, no suggestion is made that Roe is a fictitious person. For purposes of her case, we accept as true, and as established, her existence; her pregnant state, as of the inception of her suit in March 1970 and as late as May 21 of that year when she filed an alias affidavit with the District Court; and her inability to obtain a legal abortion in Texas.
Viewing Roe's case as of the time of its filing and thereafter until as late as May, there can be little dispute that it then presented a case or controversy and that, wholly apart from the class aspects, she, as a pregnant single woman thwarted by the Texas criminal abortion laws, had standing to challenge those statutes. Abele v. Markle, 452 F.2d 1121, 1125 (CA2 1971); Crossen v. Breckenridge, 446 F.2d 833, 838-839 (CA6 1971); Poe v. Menghini, 339 F. Supp. 986, 990-991 (Kan. 1972). See Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33 (1915). Indeed, we do not read the appellee's brief as really asserting anything to the contrary. The ""logical nexus between the status asserted and the claim sought to be adjudicated,"" Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S., at 102, and the necessary degree of contentiousness, Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U.S. 103 (1969), are both present.
The appellee notes, however, that the record does not disclose that Roe was pregnant at the time of the District Court hearing on May 22, 1970,[6] or on the following June 17 when the court's opinion and judgment were filed. And he suggests that Roe's case must now be moot because she and all other members of her class are no longer subject to any 1970 pregnancy.
*125 The usual rule in federal cases is that an actual controversy must exist at stages of appellate or certiorari review, and not simply at the date the action is initiated. United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36 (1950); Golden v. Zwickler, supra; SEC v. Medical Committee for Human Rights, 404 U.S. 403 (1972).
But when, as here, pregnancy is a significant fact in the litigation, the normal 266-day human gestation period is so short that the pregnancy will come to term before the usual appellate process is complete. If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied. Our law should not be that rigid. Pregnancy often comes more than once to the same woman, and in the general population, if man is to survive, it will always be with us. Pregnancy provides a classic justification for a conclusion of nonmootness. It truly could be ""capable of repetition, yet evading review."" Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U.S. 498, 515 (1911). See Moore v. Ogilvie, 394 U.S. 814, 816 (1969); Carroll v. Princess Anne, 393 U.S. 175, 178-179 (1968); United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632-633 (1953).
We, therefore, agree with the District Court that Jane Roe had standing to undertake this litigation, that she presented a justiciable controversy, and that the termination of her 1970 pregnancy has not rendered her case moot.
B. Dr. Hallford. The doctor's position is different. He entered Roe's litigation as a plaintiff-intervenor, alleging in his complaint that he:
""[I]n the past has been arrested for violating the Texas Abortion Laws and at the present time stands charged by indictment with violating said laws in the Criminal District Court of Dallas County, Texas to-wit: (1) The State of Texas vs. *126 James H. Hallford, No. C-69-5307-IH, and (2) The State of Texas vs. James H. Hallford, No. C-69-2524-H. In both cases the defendant is charged with abortion . . . .""
In his application for leave to intervene, the doctor made like representations as to the abortion charges pending in the state court. These representations were also repeated in the affidavit he executed and filed in support of his motion for summary judgment.
Dr. Hallford is, therefore, in the position of seeking, in a federal court, declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the same statutes under which he stands charged in criminal prosecutions simultaneously pending in state court. Although he stated that he has been arrested in the past for violating the State's abortion laws, he makes no allegation of any substantial and immediate threat to any federally protected right that cannot be asserted in his defense against the state prosecutions. Neither is there any allegation of harassment or bad-faith prosecution. In order to escape the rule articulated in the cases cited in the next paragraph of this opinion that, absent harassment and bad faith, a defendant in a pending state criminal case cannot affirmatively challenge in federal court the statutes under which the State is prosecuting him, Dr. Hallford seeks to distinguish his status as a present state defendant from his status as a ""potential future defendant"" and to assert only the latter for standing purposes here.
We see no merit in that distinction. Our decision in Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66 (1971), compels the conclusion that the District Court erred when it granted declaratory relief to Dr. Hallford instead of refraining from so doing. The court, of course, was correct in refusing to grant injunctive relief to the doctor. The reasons supportive of that action, however, are those expressed in Samuels v. Mackell, supra, and in Younger v. *127 Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971); Boyle v. Landry, 401 U.S. 77 (1971); Perez v. Ledesma, 401 U.S. 82 (1971); and Byrne v. Karalexis, 401 U.S. 216 (1971). See also Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479 (1965). We note, in passing, that Younger and its companion cases were decided after the three-judge District Court decision in this case.
Dr. Hallford's complaint in intervention, therefore, is to be dismissed.[7] He is remitted to his defenses in the state criminal proceedings against him. We reverse the judgment of the District Court insofar as it granted Dr. Hallford relief and failed to dismiss his complaint in intervention.
C. The Does. In view of our ruling as to Roe's standing in her case, the issue of the Does' standing in their case has little significance. The claims they assert are essentially the same as those of Roe, and they attack the same statutes. Nevertheless, we briefly note the Does' posture.
Their pleadings present them as a childless married couple, the woman not being pregnant, who have no desire to have children at this time because of their having received medical advice that Mrs. Doe should avoid pregnancy, and for ""other highly personal reasons."" But they ""fear . . . they may face the prospect of becoming *128 parents."" And if pregnancy ensues, they ""would want to terminate"" it by an abortion. They assert an inability to obtain an abortion legally in Texas and, consequently, the prospect of obtaining an illegal abortion there or of going outside Texas to some place where the procedure could be obtained legally and competently.
We thus have as plaintiffs a married couple who have, as their asserted immediate and present injury, only an alleged ""detrimental effect upon [their] marital happiness"" because they are forced to ""the choice of refraining from normal sexual relations or of endangering Mary Doe's health through a possible pregnancy."" Their claim is that sometime in the future Mrs. Doe might become pregnant because of possible failure of contraceptive measures, and at that time in the future she might want an abortion that might then be illegal under the Texas statutes.
This very phrasing of the Does' position reveals its speculative character. Their alleged injury rests on possible future contraceptive failure, possible future pregnancy, possible future unpreparedness for parenthood, and possible future impairment of health. Any one or more of these several possibilities may not take place and all may not combine. In the Does' estimation, these possibilities might have some real or imagined impact upon their marital happiness. But we are not prepared to say that the bare allegation of so indirect an injury is sufficient to present an actual case or controversy. Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S., at 41-42; Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U. S., at 109-110; Abele v. Markle, 452 F. 2d, at 1124-1125; Crossen v. Breckenridge, 446 F. 2d, at 839. The Does' claim falls far short of those resolved otherwise in the cases that the Does urge upon us, namely, Investment Co. Institute v. Camp, 401 U.S. 617 (1971); Data Processing Service v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150 (1970); *129 and Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97 (1968). See also Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33 (1915).
The Does therefore are not appropriate plaintiffs in this litigation. Their complaint was properly dismissed by the District Court, and we affirm that dismissal.

V
The principal thrust of appellant's attack on the Texas statutes is that they improperly invade a right, said to be possessed by the pregnant woman, to choose to terminate her pregnancy. Appellant would discover this right in the concept of personal ""liberty"" embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause; or in personal, marital, familial, and sexual privacy said to be protected by the Bill of Rights or its penumbras, see Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972); id., at 460 (WHITE, J., concurring in result); or among those rights reserved to the people by the Ninth Amendment, Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S., at 486 (Goldberg, J., concurring). Before addressing this claim, we feel it desirable briefly to survey, in several aspects, the history of abortion, for such insight as that history may afford us, and then to examine the state purposes and interests behind the criminal abortion laws.

VI
It perhaps is not generally appreciated that the restrictive criminal abortion laws in effect in a majority of States today are of relatively recent vintage. Those laws, generally proscribing abortion or its attempt at any time during pregnancy except when necessary to preserve the pregnant woman's life, are not of ancient or even of common-law origin. Instead, they derive from statutory changes effected, for the most part, in the latter half of the 19th century.
*130 1. Ancient attitudes. These are not capable of precise determination. We are told that at the time of the Persian Empire abortifacients were known and that criminal abortions were severely punished.[8] We are also told, however, that abortion was practiced in Greek times as well as in the Roman Era,[9] and that ""it was resorted to without scruple.""[10] The Ephesian, Soranos, often described as the greatest of the ancient gynecologists, appears to have been generally opposed to Rome's prevailing free-abortion practices. He found it necessary to think first of the life of the mother, and he resorted to abortion when, upon this standard, he felt the procedure advisable.[11] Greek and Roman law afforded little protection to the unborn. If abortion was prosecuted in some places, it seems to have been based on a concept of a violation of the father's right to his offspring. Ancient religion did not bar abortion.[12]
2. The Hippocratic Oath. What then of the famous Oath that has stood so long as the ethical guide of the medical profession and that bears the name of the great Greek (460(?)-377(?) B. C.), who has been described *131 as the Father of Medicine, the ""wisest and the greatest practitioner of his art,"" and the ""most important and most complete medical personality of antiquity,"" who dominated the medical schools of his time, and who typified the sum of the medical knowledge of the past?[13] The Oath varies somewhat according to the particular translation, but in any translation the content is clear: ""I will give no deadly medicine to anyone if asked, nor suggest any such counsel; and in like manner I will not give to a woman a pessary to produce abortion,""[14] or ""I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect. Similarly, I will not give to a woman an abortive remedy.""[15]
Although the Oath is not mentioned in any of the principal briefs in this case or in Doe v. Bolton, post, p. 179, it represents the apex of the development of strict ethical concepts in medicine, and its influence endures to this day. Why did not the authority of Hippocrates dissuade abortion practice in his time and that of Rome? The late Dr. Edelstein provides us with a theory:[16] The Oath was not uncontested even in Hippocrates' day; only the Pythagorean school of philosophers frowned upon the related act of suicide. Most Greek thinkers, on the other hand, commended abortion, at least prior to viability. See Plato, Republic, V, 461; Aristotle, Politics, VII, 1335b 25. For the Pythagoreans, however, it was a matter of dogma. For them the embryo was animate from the moment of conception, and abortion meant destruction of a living being. The abortion clause of the Oath, therefore, ""echoes Pythagorean doctrines,"" *132 and ""[i]n no other stratum of Greek opinion were such views held or proposed in the same spirit of uncompromising austerity.""[17]
Dr. Edelstein then concludes that the Oath originated in a group representing only a small segment of Greek opinion and that it certainly was not accepted by all ancient physicians. He points out that medical writings down to Galen (A. D. 130-200) ""give evidence of the violation of almost every one of its injunctions.""[18] But with the end of antiquity a decided change took place. Resistance against suicide and against abortion became common. The Oath came to be popular. The emerging teachings of Christianity were in agreement with the Pythagorean ethic. The Oath ""became the nucleus of all medical ethics"" and ""was applauded as the embodiment of truth."" Thus, suggests Dr. Edelstein, it is ""a Pythagorean manifesto and not the expression of an absolute standard of medical conduct.""[19]
This, it seems to us, is a satisfactory and acceptable explanation of the Hippocratic Oath's apparent rigidity. It enables us to understand, in historical context, a long-accepted and revered statement of medical ethics.
3. The common law. It is undisputed that at common law, abortion performed before ""quickening"" the first recognizable movement of the fetus in utero, appearing usually from the 16th to the 18th week of pregnancy[20]was not an indictable offense.[21] The absence *133 of a common-law crime for pre-quickening abortion appears to have developed from a confluence of earlier philosophical, theological, and civil and canon law concepts of when life begins. These disciplines variously approached the question in terms of the point at which the embryo or fetus became ""formed"" or recognizably human, or in terms of when a ""person"" came into being, that is, infused with a ""soul"" or ""animated."" A loose consensus evolved in early English law that these events occurred at some point between conception and live birth.[22] This was ""mediate animation."" Although *134 Christian theology and the canon law came to fix the point of animation at 40 days for a male and 80 days for a female, a view that persisted until the 19th century, there was otherwise little agreement about the precise time of formation or animation. There was agreement, however, that prior to this point the fetus was to be regarded as part of the mother, and its destruction, therefore, was not homicide. Due to continued uncertainty about the precise time when animation occurred, to the lack of any empirical basis for the 40-80-day view, and perhaps to Aquinas' definition of movement as one of the two first principles of life, Bracton focused upon quickening as the critical point. The significance of quickening was echoed by later common-law scholars and found its way into the received common law in this country.
Whether abortion of a quick fetus was a felony at common law, or even a lesser crime, is still disputed. Bracton, writing early in the 13th century, thought it homicide.[23] But the later and predominant view, following the great common-law scholars, has been that it was, at most, a lesser offense. In a frequently cited *135 passage, Coke took the position that abortion of a woman ""quick with childe"" is ""a great misprision, and no murder.""[24] Blackstone followed, saying that while abortion after quickening had once been considered manslaughter (though not murder), ""modern law"" took a less severe view.[25] A recent review of the common-law precedents argues, however, that those precedents contradict Coke and that even post-quickening abortion was never established as a common-law crime.[26] This is of some importance because while most American courts ruled, in holding or dictum, that abortion of an unquickened fetus was not criminal under their received common law,[27] others followed Coke in stating that abortion *136 of a quick fetus was a ""misprision,"" a term they translated to mean ""misdemeanor.""[28] That their reliance on Coke on this aspect of the law was uncritical and, apparently in all the reported cases, dictum (due probably to the paucity of common-law prosecutions for post-quickening abortion), makes it now appear doubtful that abortion was ever firmly established as a common-law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick fetus.
4. The English statutory law. England's first criminal abortion statute, Lord Ellenborough's Act, 43 Geo. 3, c. 58, came in 1803. It made abortion of a quick fetus, § 1, a capital crime, but in § 2 it provided lesser penalties for the felony of abortion before quickening, and thus preserved the ""quickening"" distinction. This contrast was continued in the general revision of 1828, 9 Geo. 4, c. 31, § 13. It disappeared, however, together with the death penalty, in 1837, 7 Will. 4 & 1 Vict., c. 85. § 6, and did not reappear in the Offenses Against the Person Act of 1861, 24 & 25 Vict., c. 100, § 59, that formed the core of English anti-abortion law until the liberalizing reforms of 1967. In 1929, the Infant Life (Preservation) Act, 19 & 20 Geo. 5, c. 34, came into being. Its emphasis was upon the destruction of ""the life of a child capable of being born alive."" It made a willful act performed with the necessary intent a felony. It contained a proviso that one was not to be *137 found guilty of the offense ""unless it is proved that the act which caused the death of the child was not done in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life of the mother.""
A seemingly notable development in the English law was the case of Rex v. Bourne, [1939] 1 K. B. 687. This case apparently answered in the affirmative the question whether an abortion necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman was excepted from the criminal penalties of the 1861 Act. In his instructions to the jury, Judge Macnaghten referred to the 1929 Act, and observed that that Act related to ""the case where a child is killed by a wilful act at the time when it is being delivered in the ordinary course of nature."" Id., at 691. He concluded that the 1861 Act's use of the word ""unlawfully,"" imported the same meaning expressed by the specific proviso in the 1929 Act, even though there was no mention of preserving the mother's life in the 1861 Act. He then construed the phrase ""preserving the life of the mother"" broadly, that is, ""in a reasonable sense,"" to include a serious and permanent threat to the mother's health, and instructed the jury to acquit Dr. Bourne if it found he had acted in a good-faith belief that the abortion was necessary for this purpose. Id., at 693-694. The jury did acquit.
Recently, Parliament enacted a new abortion law. This is the Abortion Act of 1967, 15 & 16 Eliz. 2, c. 87. The Act permits a licensed physician to perform an abortion where two other licensed physicians agree (a) ""that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman, or of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman or any existing children of her family, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated,"" or (b) ""that there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as *138 to be seriously handicapped."" The Act also provides that, in making this determination, ""account may be taken of the pregnant woman's actual or reasonably foreseeable environment."" It also permits a physician, without the concurrence of others, to terminate a pregnancy where he is of the good-faith opinion that the abortion ""is immediately necessary to save the life or to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman.""
5. The American law. In this country, the law in effect in all but a few States until mid-19th century was the pre-existing English common law. Connecticut, the first State to enact abortion legislation, adopted in 1821 that part of Lord Ellenborough's Act that related to a woman ""quick with child.""[29] The death penalty was not imposed. Abortion before quickening was made a crime in that State only in 1860.[30] In 1828, New York enacted legislation[31] that, in two respects, was to serve as a model for early anti-abortion statutes. First, while barring destruction of an unquickened fetus as well as a quick fetus, it made the former only a misdemeanor, but the latter second-degree manslaughter. Second, it incorporated a concept of therapeutic abortion by providing that an abortion was excused if it ""shall have been necessary to preserve the life of such mother, or shall have been advised by two physicians to be necessary for such purpose."" By 1840, when Texas had received the common law,[32] only eight American States *139 had statutes dealing with abortion.[33] It was not until after the War Between the States that legislation began generally to replace the common law. Most of these initial statutes dealt severely with abortion after quickening but were lenient with it before quickening. Most punished attempts equally with completed abortions. While many statutes included the exception for an abortion thought by one or more physicians to be necessary to save the mother's life, that provision soon disappeared and the typical law required that the procedure actually be necessary for that purpose.
Gradually, in the middle and late 19th century the quickening distinction disappeared from the statutory law of most States and the degree of the offense and the penalties were increased. By the end of the 1950's, a large majority of the jurisdictions banned abortion, however and whenever performed, unless done to save or preserve the life of the mother.[34] The exceptions, Alabama and the District of Columbia, permitted abortion to preserve the mother's health.[35] Three States permitted abortions that were not ""unlawfully"" performed or that were not ""without lawful justification,"" leaving interpretation of those standards to the courts.[36] In *140 the past several years, however, a trend toward liberalization of abortion statutes has resulted in adoption, by about one-third of the States, of less stringent laws, most of them patterned after the ALI Model Penal Code, § 230.3,[37] set forth as Appendix B to the opinion in Doe v. Bolton, post, p. 205.
It is thus apparent that at common law, at the time of the adoption of our Constitution, and throughout the major portion of the 19th century, abortion was viewed with less disfavor than under most American statutes currently in effect. Phrasing it another way, a woman enjoyed a substantially broader right to terminate a pregnancy than she does in most States today. At least with respect to the early stage of pregnancy, and very possibly without such a limitation, the opportunity *141 to make this choice was present in this country well into the 19th century. Even later, the law continued for some time to treat less punitively an abortion procured in early pregnancy.
6. The position of the American Medical Association. The anti-abortion mood prevalent in this country in the late 19th century was shared by the medical profession. Indeed, the attitude of the profession may have played a significant role in the enactment of stringent criminal abortion legislation during that period.
An AMA Committee on Criminal Abortion was appointed in May 1857. It presented its report, 12 Trans. of the Am. Med. Assn. 73-78 (1859), to the Twelfth Annual Meeting. That report observed that the Committee had been appointed to investigate criminal abortion ""with a view to its general suppression."" It deplored abortion and its frequency and it listed three causes of ""this general demoralization"":
""The first of these causes is a wide-spread popular ignorance of the true character of the crime a belief, even among mothers themselves, that the foetus is not alive till after the period of quickening.
""The second of the agents alluded to is the fact that the profession themselves are frequently supposed careless of foetal life . . . .
""The third reason of the frightful extent of this crime is found in the grave defects of our laws, both common and statute, as regards the independent and actual existence of the child before birth, as a living being. These errors, which are sufficient in most instances to prevent conviction, are based, and only based, upon mistaken and exploded medical dogmas. With strange inconsistency, the law fully acknowledges the foetus in utero and its inherent rights, for civil purposes; while personally and as criminally affected, it fails to recognize it, *142 and to its life as yet denies all protection."" Id., at 75-76.
The Committee then offered, and the Association adopted, resolutions protesting ""against such unwarrantable destruction of human life,"" calling upon state legislatures to revise their abortion laws, and requesting the cooperation of state medical societies ""in pressing the subject."" Id., at 28, 78.
In 1871 a long and vivid report was submitted by the Committee on Criminal Abortion. It ended with the observation, ""We had to deal with human life. In a matter of less importance we could entertain no compromise. An honest judge on the bench would call things by their proper names. We could do no less."" 22 Trans. of the Am. Med. Assn. 258 (1871). It proffered resolutions, adopted by the Association, id., at 38-39, recommending, among other things, that it ""be unlawful and unprofessional for any physician to induce abortion or premature labor, without the concurrent opinion of at least one respectable consulting physician, and then always with a view to the safety of the child if that be possible,"" and calling ""the attention of the clergy of all denominations to the perverted views of morality entertained by a large class of femalesaye, and men also, on this important question.""
Except for periodic condemnation of the criminal abortionist, no further formal AMA action took place until 1967. In that year, the Committee on Human Reproduction urged the adoption of a stated policy of opposition to induced abortion, except when there is ""documented medical evidence"" of a threat to the health or life of the mother, or that the child ""may be born with incapacitating physical deformity or mental deficiency,"" or that a pregnancy ""resulting from legally established statutory or forcible rape or incest may constitute a threat to the mental or physical health of the *143 patient,"" two other physicians ""chosen because of their recognized professional competence have examined the patient and have concurred in writing,"" and the procedure ""is performed in a hospital accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals."" The providing of medical information by physicians to state legislatures in their consideration of legislation regarding therapeutic abortion was ""to be considered consistent with the principles of ethics of the American Medical Association."" This recommendation was adopted by the House of Delegates. Proceedings of the AMA House of Delegates 40-51 (June 1967).
In 1970, after the introduction of a variety of proposed resolutions, and of a report from its Board of Trustees, a reference committee noted ""polarization of the medical profession on this controversial issue""; division among those who had testified; a difference of opinion among AMA councils and committees; ""the remarkable shift in testimony"" in six months, felt to be influenced ""by the rapid changes in state laws and by the judicial decisions which tend to make abortion more freely available;"" and a feeling ""that this trend will continue."" On June 25, 1970, the House of Delegates adopted preambles and most of the resolutions proposed by the reference committee. The preambles emphasized ""the best interests of the patient,"" ""sound clinical judgment,"" and ""informed patient consent,"" in contrast to ""mere acquiescence to the patient's demand."" The resolutions asserted that abortion is a medical procedure that should be performed by a licensed physician in an accredited hospital only after consultation with two other physicians and in conformity with state law, and that no party to the procedure should be required to violate personally held moral principles.[38] Proceedings *144 of the AMA House of Delegates 220 (June 1970). The AMA Judicial Council rendered a complementary opinion.[39]
7. The position of the American Public Health Association. In October 1970, the Executive Board of the APHA adopted Standards for Abortion Services. These were five in number:
""a. Rapid and simple abortion referral must be readily available through state and local public *145 health departments, medical societies, or other nonprofit organizations.
""b. An important function of counselling should be to simplify and expedite the provision of abortion services; it should not delay the obtaining of these services.
""c. Psychiatric consultation should not be mandatory. As in the case of other specialized medical services, psychiatric consultation should be sought for definite indications and not on a routine basis.
""d. A wide range of individuals from appropriately trained, sympathetic volunteers to highly skilled physicians may qualify as abortion counselors.
""e. Contraception and/or sterilization should be discussed with each abortion patient."" Recommended Standards for Abortion Services, 61 Am. J. Pub. Health 396 (1971).
Among factors pertinent to life and health risks associated with abortion were three that ""are recognized as important"":
""a. the skill of the physician,
""b. the environment in which the abortion is performed, and above all
""c. the duration of pregnancy, as determined by uterine size and confirmed by menstrual history."" Id., at 397.
It was said that ""a well-equipped hospital"" offers more protection ""to cope with unforeseen difficulties than an office or clinic without such resources. . . . The factor of gestational age is of overriding importance."" Thus, it was recommended that abortions in the second trimester and early abortions in the presence of existing medical complications be performed in hospitals as inpatient procedures. For pregnancies in the first trimester, *146 abortion in the hospital with or without overnight stay ""is probably the safest practice."" An abortion in an extramural facility, however, is an acceptable alternative ""provided arrangements exist in advance to admit patients promptly if unforeseen complications develop."" Standards for an abortion facility were listed. It was said that at present abortions should be performed by physicians or osteopaths who are licensed to practice and who have ""adequate training."" Id., at 398.
8. The position of the American Bar Association. At its meeting in February 1972 the ABA House of Delegates approved, with 17 opposing votes, the Uniform Abortion Act that had been drafted and approved the preceding August by the Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. 58 A. B. A. J. 380 (1972). We set forth the Act in full in the margin.[40] The *147 Conference has appended an enlightening Prefatory Note.[41]

VII
Three reasons have been advanced to explain historically the enactment of criminal abortion laws in the 19th century and to justify their continued existence.
*148 It has been argued occasionally that these laws were the product of a Victorian social concern to discourage illicit sexual conduct. Texas, however, does not advance this justification in the present case, and it appears that no court or commentator has taken the argument seriously.[42] The appellants and amici contend, moreover, that this is not a proper state purpose at all and suggest that, if it were, the Texas statutes are overbroad in protecting it since the law fails to distinguish between married and unwed mothers.
A second reason is concerned with abortion as a medical procedure. When most criminal abortion laws were first enacted, the procedure was a hazardous one for the woman.[43] This was particularly true prior to the *149 development of antisepsis. Antiseptic techniques, of course, were based on discoveries by Lister, Pasteur, and others first announced in 1867, but were not generally accepted and employed until about the turn of the century. Abortion mortality was high. Even after 1900, and perhaps until as late as the development of antibiotics in the 1940's, standard modern techniques such as dilation and curettage were not nearly so safe as they are today. Thus, it has been argued that a State's real concern in enacting a criminal abortion law was to protect the pregnant woman, that is, to restrain her from submitting to a procedure that placed her life in serious jeopardy.
Modern medical techniques have altered this situation. Appellants and various amici refer to medical data indicating that abortion in early pregnancy, that is, prior to the end of the first trimester, although not without its risk, is now relatively safe. Mortality rates for women undergoing early abortions, where the procedure is legal, appear to be as low as or lower than the rates for normal childbirth.[44] Consequently, any interest of the State in protecting the woman from an inherently hazardous procedure, except when it would be equally dangerous for her to forgo it, has largely disappeared. Of course, important state interests in the areas of health and medical standards do remain. *150 The State has a legitimate interest in seeing to it that abortion, like any other medical procedure, is performed under circumstances that insure maximum safety for the patient. This interest obviously extends at least to the performing physician and his staff, to the facilities involved, to the availability of after-care, and to adequate provision for any complication or emergency that might arise. The prevalence of high mortality rates at illegal ""abortion mills"" strengthens, rather than weakens, the State's interest in regulating the conditions under which abortions are performed. Moreover, the risk to the woman increases as her pregnancy continues. Thus, the State retains a definite interest in protecting the woman's own health and safety when an abortion is proposed at a late stage of pregnancy.
The third reason is the State's interestsome phrase it in terms of dutyin protecting prenatal life. Some of the argument for this justification rests on the theory that a new human life is present from the moment of conception.[45] The State's interest and general obligation to protect life then extends, it is argued, to prenatal life. Only when the life of the pregnant mother herself is at stake, balanced against the life she carries within her, should the interest of the embryo or fetus not prevail. Logically, of course, a legitimate state interest in this area need not stand or fall on acceptance of the belief that life begins at conception or at some other point prior to live birth. In assessing the State's interest, recognition may be given to the less rigid claim that as long as at least potential life is involved, the State may assert interests beyond the protection of the pregnant woman alone.
*151 Parties challenging state abortion laws have sharply disputed in some courts the contention that a purpose of these laws, when enacted, was to protect prenatal life.[46] Pointing to the absence of legislative history to support the contention, they claim that most state laws were designed solely to protect the woman. Because medical advances have lessened this concern, at least with respect to abortion in early pregnancy, they argue that with respect to such abortions the laws can no longer be justified by any state interest. There is some scholarly support for this view of original purpose.[47] The few state courts called upon to interpret their laws in the late 19th and early 20th centuries did focus on the State's interest in protecting the woman's health rather than in preserving the embryo and fetus.[48] Proponents of this view point out that in many States, including Texas,[49] by statute or judicial interpretation, the pregnant woman herself could not be prosecuted for self-abortion or for cooperating in an abortion performed upon her by another.[50] They claim that adoption of the ""quickening"" distinction through received common *152 law and state statutes tacitly recognizes the greater health hazards inherent in late abortion and impliedly repudiates the theory that life begins at conception.
It is with these interests, and the weight to be attached to them, that this case is concerned.

VIII
The Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, going back perhaps as far as Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U.S. 250, 251 (1891), the Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the Constitution. In varying contexts, the Court or individual Justices have, indeed, found at least the roots of that right in the First Amendment, Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 564 (1969); in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 8-9 (1968), Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 350 (1967), Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616 (1886), see Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting); in the penumbras of the Bill of Rights, Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S., at 484-485; in the Ninth Amendment, id., at 486 (Goldberg, J., concurring); or in the concept of liberty guaranteed by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment, see Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 (1923). These decisions make it clear that only personal rights that can be deemed ""fundamental"" or ""implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,"" Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325 (1937), are included in this guarantee of personal privacy. They also make it clear that the right has some extension to activities relating to marriage, Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967); procreation, Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541-542 (1942); contraception, Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S., at 453-454; id., at 460, 463-465 *153 (WHITE, J., concurring in result); family relationships, Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166 (1944); and child rearing and education, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 535 (1925), Meyer v. Nebraska, supra.
This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. The detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent. Specific and direct harm medically diagnosable even in early pregnancy may be involved. Maternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care. There is also the distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it. In other cases, as in this one, the additional difficulties and continuing stigma of unwed motherhood may be involved. All these are factors the woman and her responsible physician necessarily will consider in consultation.
On the basis of elements such as these, appellant and some amici argue that the woman's right is absolute and that she is entitled to terminate her pregnancy at whatever time, in whatever way, and for whatever reason she alone chooses. With this we do not agree. Appellant's arguments that Texas either has no valid interest at all in regulating the abortion decision, or no interest strong enough to support any limitation upon the woman's sole determination, are unpersuasive. The *154 Court's decisions recognizing a right of privacy also acknowledge that some state regulation in areas protected by that right is appropriate. As noted above, a State may properly assert important interests in safeguarding health, in maintaining medical standards, and in protecting potential life. At some point in pregnancy, these respective interests become sufficiently compelling to sustain regulation of the factors that govern the abortion decision. The privacy right involved, therefore, cannot be said to be absolute. In fact, it is not clear to us that the claim asserted by some amici that one has an unlimited right to do with one's body as one pleases bears a close relationship to the right of privacy previously articulated in the Court's decisions. The Court has refused to recognize an unlimited right of this kind in the past. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905) (vaccination); Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200 (1927) (sterilization).
We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation.
We note that those federal and state courts that have recently considered abortion law challenges have reached the same conclusion. A majority, in addition to the District Court in the present case, have held state laws unconstitutional, at least in part, because of vagueness or because of overbreadth and abridgment of rights. Abele v. Markle, 342 F. Supp. 800 (Conn. 1972), appeal docketed, No. 72-56; Abele v. Markle, 351 F. Supp. 224 (Conn. 1972), appeal docketed, No. 72-730; Doe v. Bolton, 319 F. Supp. 1048 (ND Ga. 1970), appeal decided today, post, p. 179; Doe v. Scott, 321 F. Supp. 1385 (ND Ill. 1971), appeal docketed, No. 70-105; Poe v. Menghini, 339 F. Supp. 986 (Kan. 1972); YWCA v. Kugler, 342 F. Supp. 1048 (NJ 1972); Babbitz v. McCann, *155 310 F. Supp. 293 (ED Wis. 1970), appeal dismissed, 400 U.S. 1 (1970); People v. Belous, 71 Cal. 2d 954, 458 P.2d 194 (1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 915 (1970); State v. Barquet, 262 So. 2d 431 (Fla. 1972).
Others have sustained state statutes. Crossen v. Attorney General, 344 F. Supp. 587 (ED Ky. 1972), appeal docketed, No. 72-256; Rosen v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, 318 F. Supp. 1217 (ED La. 1970), appeal docketed, No. 70-42; Corkey v. Edwards, 322 F. Supp. 1248 (WDNC 1971), appeal docketed, No. 71-92; Steinberg v. Brown, 321 F. Supp. 741 (ND Ohio 1970); Doe v. Rampton (Utah 1971), appeal docketed, No. 71-5666; Cheaney v. State, ___ Ind. ___, 285 N.E.2d 265 (1972); Spears v. State, 257 So. 2d 876 (Miss. 1972); State v. Munson, 86 S. D. 663, 201 N.W.2d 123 (1972), appeal docketed, No. 72-631.
Although the results are divided, most of these courts have agreed that the right of privacy, however based, is broad enough to cover the abortion decision; that the right, nonetheless, is not absolute and is subject to some limitations; and that at some point the state interests as to protection of health, medical standards, and prenatal life, become dominant. We agree with this approach.
Where certain ""fundamental rights"" are involved, the Court has held that regulation limiting these rights may be justified only by a ""compelling state interest,"" Kramer v. Union Free School District, 395 U.S. 621, 627 (1969); Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 634 (1969), Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 406 (1963), and that legislative enactments must be narrowly drawn to express only the legitimate state interests at stake. Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S., at 485; Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U.S. 500, 508 (1964); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 307-308 (1940); see *156 Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S., at 460, 463-464 (WHITE, J., concurring in result).
In the recent abortion cases, cited above, courts have recognized these principles. Those striking down state laws have generally scrutinized the State's interests in protecting health and potential life, and have concluded that neither interest justified broad limitations on the reasons for which a physician and his pregnant patient might decide that she should have an abortion in the early stages of pregnancy. Courts sustaining state laws have held that the State's determinations to protect health or prenatal life are dominant and constitutionally justifiable.

IX
The District Court held that the appellee failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that the Texas statute's infringement upon Roe's rights was necessary to support a compelling state interest, and that, although the appellee presented ""several compelling justifications for state presence in the area of abortions,"" the statutes outstripped these justifications and swept ""far beyond any areas of compelling state interest."" 314 F. Supp., at 1222-1223. Appellant and appellee both contest that holding. Appellant, as has been indicated, claims an absolute right that bars any state imposition of criminal penalties in the area. Appellee argues that the State's determination to recognize and protect prenatal life from and after conception constitutes a compelling state interest. As noted above, we do not agree fully with either formulation.
A. The appellee and certain amici argue that the fetus is a ""person"" within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. In support of this, they outline at length and in detail the well-known facts of fetal development. If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, *157 for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment. The appellant conceded as much on reargument.[51] On the other hand, the appellee conceded on reargument[52] that no case could be cited that holds that a fetus is a person within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The Constitution does not define ""person"" in so many words. Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains three references to ""person."" The first, in defining ""citizens,"" speaks of ""persons born or naturalized in the United States."" The word also appears both in the Due Process Clause and in the Equal Protection Clause. ""Person"" is used in other places in the Constitution: in the listing of qualifications for Representatives and Senators, Art. I, § 2, cl. 2, and § 3, cl. 3; in the Apportionment Clause, Art. I, § 2, cl. 3;[53] in the Migration and Importation provision, Art. I, § 9, cl. 1; in the Emolument Clause, Art. I, § 9, cl. 8; in the Electors provisions, Art. II, § 1, cl. 2, and the superseded cl. 3; in the provision outlining qualifications for the office of President, Art. II, § 1, cl. 5; in the Extradition provisions, Art. IV, § 2, cl. 2, and the superseded Fugitive Slave Clause 3; and in the Fifth, Twelfth, and Twenty-second Amendments, as well as in §§ 2 and 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment. But in nearly all these instances, the use of the word is such that it has application only postnatally. None indicates, with any assurance, that it has any possible pre-natal application.[54]
*158 All this, together with our observation, supra, that throughout the major portion of the 19th century prevailing legal abortion practices were far freer than they are today, persuades us that the word ""person,"" as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn.[55] This is in accord with the results reached in those few cases where the issue has been squarely presented. McGarvey v. Magee-Womens Hospital, 340 F. Supp. 751 (WD Pa. 1972); Byrn v. New York City Health & Hospitals Corp., 31 N.Y. 2d 194, 286 N.E.2d 887 (1972), appeal docketed, No. 72-434; Abele v. Markle, 351 F. Supp. 224 (Conn. 1972), appeal docketed, No. 72-730. Cf. Cheaney v. State, ___ Ind., at ___, 285 N. E. 2d, at 270; Montana v. Rogers, 278 F.2d 68, 72 (CA7 1960), aff'd sub nom. Montana v. Kennedy, 366 U.S. 308 (1961); Keeler v. Superior Court, 2 Cal. 3d 619, 470 P.2d 617 (1970); State v. Dickinson, 28 *159 Ohio St. 2d 65, 275 N.E.2d 599 (1971). Indeed, our decision in United States v. Vuitch, 402 U.S. 62 (1971), inferentially is to the same effect, for we there would not have indulged in statutory interpretation favorable to abortion in specified circumstances if the necessary consequence was the termination of life entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection.
This conclusion, however, does not of itself fully answer the contentions raised by Texas, and we pass on to other considerations.
B. The pregnant woman cannot be isolated in her privacy. She carries an embryo and, later, a fetus, if one accepts the medical definitions of the developing young in the human uterus. See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 478-479, 547 (24th ed. 1965). The situation therefore is inherently different from marital intimacy, or bedroom possession of obscene material, or marriage, or procreation, or education, with which Eisenstadt and Griswold, Stanley, Loving, Skinner, and Pierce and Meyer were respectively concerned. As we have intimated above, it is reasonable and appropriate for a State to decide that at some point in time another interest, that of health of the mother or that of potential human life, becomes significantly involved. The woman's privacy is no longer sole and any right of privacy she possesses must be measured accordingly.
Texas urges that, apart from the Fourteenth Amendment, life begins at conception and is present throughout pregnancy, and that, therefore, the State has a compelling interest in protecting that life from and after conception. We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer.
*160 It should be sufficient to note briefly the wide divergence of thinking on this most sensitive and difficult question. There has always been strong support for the view that life does not begin until live birth. This was the belief of the Stoics.[56] It appears to be the predominant, though not the unanimous, attitude of the Jewish faith.[57] It may be taken to represent also the position of a large segment of the Protestant community, insofar as that can be ascertained; organized groups that have taken a formal position on the abortion issue have generally regarded abortion as a matter for the conscience of the individual and her family.[58] As we have noted, the common law found greater significance in quickening. Physicians and their scientific colleagues have regarded that event with less interest and have tended to focus either upon conception, upon live birth, or upon the interim point at which the fetus becomes ""viable,"" that is, potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid.[59] Viability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.[60] The Aristotelian theory of ""mediate animation,"" that held sway throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance in Europe, continued to be official Roman Catholic dogma until the 19th century, despite opposition to this ""ensoulment"" theory from those in the Church who would recognize the existence of life from *161 the moment of conception.[61] The latter is now, of course, the official belief of the Catholic Church. As one brief amicus discloses, this is a view strongly held by many non-Catholics as well, and by many physicians. Substantial problems for precise definition of this view are posed, however, by new embryological data that purport to indicate that conception is a ""process"" over time, rather than an event, and by new medical techniques such as menstrual extraction, the ""morning-after"" pill, implantation of embryos, artificial insemination, and even artificial wombs.[62]
In areas other than criminal abortion, the law has been reluctant to endorse any theory that life, as we recognize it, begins before live birth or to accord legal rights to the unborn except in narrowly defined situations and except when the rights are contingent upon live birth. For example, the traditional rule of tort law denied recovery for prenatal injuries even though the child was born alive.[63] That rule has been changed in almost every jurisdiction. In most States, recovery is said to be permitted only if the fetus was viable, or at least quick, when the injuries were sustained, though few *162 courts have squarely so held.[64] In a recent development, generally opposed by the commentators, some States permit the parents of a stillborn child to maintain an action for wrongful death because of prenatal injuries.[65] Such an action, however, would appear to be one to vindicate the parents' interest and is thus consistent with the view that the fetus, at most, represents only the potentiality of life. Similarly, unborn children have been recognized as acquiring rights or interests by way of inheritance or other devolution of property, and have been represented by guardians ad litem.[66] Perfection of the interests involved, again, has generally been contingent upon live birth. In short, the unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in the whole sense.

X
In view of all this, we do not agree that, by adopting one theory of life, Texas may override the rights of the pregnant woman that are at stake. We repeat, however, that the State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman, whether she be a resident of the State or a nonresident who seeks medical consultation and treatment there, and that it has still another important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life. These interests are separate and distinct. Each grows in substantiality as the woman approaches *163 term and, at a point during pregnancy, each becomes ""compelling.""
With respect to the State's important and legitimate interest in the health of the mother, the ""compelling"" point, in the light of present medical knowledge, is at approximately the end of the first trimester. This is so because of the now-established medical fact, referred to above at 149, that until the end of the first trimester mortality in abortion may be less than mortality in normal childbirth. It follows that, from and after this point, a State may regulate the abortion procedure to the extent that the regulation reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of maternal health. Examples of permissible state regulation in this area are requirements as to the qualifications of the person who is to perform the abortion; as to the licensure of that person; as to the facility in which the procedure is to be performed, that is, whether it must be a hospital or may be a clinic or some other place of less-than-hospital status; as to the licensing of the facility; and the like.
This means, on the other hand, that, for the period of pregnancy prior to this ""compelling"" point, the attending physician, in consultation with his patient, is free to determine, without regulation by the State, that, in his medical judgment, the patient's pregnancy should be terminated. If that decision is reached, the judgment may be effectuated by an abortion free of interference by the State.
With respect to the State's important and legitimate interest in potential life, the ""compelling"" point is at viability. This is so because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb. State regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications. If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion *164 during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.
Measured against these standards, Art. 1196 of the Texas Penal Code, in restricting legal abortions to those ""procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother,"" sweeps too broadly. The statute makes no distinction between abortions performed early in pregnancy and those performed later, and it limits to a single reason, ""saving"" the mother's life, the legal justification for the procedure. The statute, therefore, cannot survive the constitutional attack made upon it here.
This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider the additional challenge to the Texas statute asserted on grounds of vagueness. See United States v. Vuitch, 402 U. S., at 67-72.

XI
To summarize and to repeat:
1. A state criminal abortion statute of the current Texas type, that excepts from criminality only a life-saving procedure on behalf of the mother, without regard to pregnancy stage and without recognition of the other interests involved, is violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician.
(b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.
(c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life *165 may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.
2. The State may define the term ""physician,"" as it has been employed in the preceding paragraphs of this Part XI of this opinion, to mean only a physician currently licensed by the State, and may proscribe any abortion by a person who is not a physician as so defined.
In Doe v. Bolton, post, p. 179, procedural requirements contained in one of the modern abortion statutes are considered. That opinion and this one, of course, are to be read together.[67]
This holding, we feel, is consistent with the relative weights of the respective interests involved, with the lessons and examples of medical and legal history, with the lenity of the common law, and with the demands of the profound problems of the present day. The decision leaves the State free to place increasing restrictions on abortion as the period of pregnancy lengthens, so long as those restrictions are tailored to the recognized state interests. The decision vindicates the right of the physician to administer medical treatment according to his professional judgment up to the points where important *166 state interests provide compelling justifications for intervention. Up to those points, the abortion decision in all its aspects is inherently, and primarily, a medical decision, and basic responsibility for it must rest with the physician. If an individual practitioner abuses the privilege of exercising proper medical judgment, the usual remedies, judicial and intra-professional, are available.

XII
Our conclusion that Art. 1196 is unconstitutional means, of course, that the Texas abortion statutes, as a unit, must fall. The exception of Art. 1196 cannot be struck down separately, for then the State would be left with a statute proscribing all abortion procedures no matter how medically urgent the case.
Although the District Court granted appellant Roe declaratory relief, it stopped short of issuing an injunction against enforcement of the Texas statutes. The Court has recognized that different considerations enter into a federal court's decision as to declaratory relief, on the one hand, and injunctive relief, on the other. Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241, 252-255 (1967); Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479 (1965). We are not dealing with a statute that, on its face, appears to abridge free expression, an area of particular concern under Dombrowski and refined in Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S., at 50.
We find it unnecessary to decide whether the District Court erred in withholding injunctive relief, for we assume the Texas prosecutorial authorities will give full credence to this decision that the present criminal abortion statutes of that State are unconstitutional.
The judgment of the District Court as to intervenor Hallford is reversed, and Dr. Hallford's complaint in intervention is dismissed. In all other respects, the judgment *167 of the District Court is affirmed. Costs are allowed to the appellee.
It is so ordered.

MR."
765,Justice Rehnquist,dissenting,False,Roe v. Wade,,1973,2.0,"The Court's opinion brings to the decision of this troubling question both extensive historical fact and a wealth of legal scholarship. While the opinion thus commands my respect, I find myself nonetheless in fundamental disagreement with those parts of it that invalidate the Texas statute in question, and therefore dissent.

I
The Court's opinion decides that a State may impose virtually no restriction on the performance of abortions during the first trimester of pregnancy. Our previous decisions indicate that a necessary predicate for such an opinion is a plaintiff who was in her first trimester of pregnancy at some time during the pendency of her law-suit. While a party may vindicate his own constitutional rights, he may not seek vindication for the rights of others. Moose Lodge v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163 (1972); Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727 (1972). The Court's statement of facts in this case makes clear, however, that the record in no way indicates the presence of such a plaintiff. We know only that plaintiff Roe at the time of filing her complaint was a pregnant woman; for aught that appears in this record, she may have been in her last trimester of pregnancy as of the date the complaint was filed.
Nothing in the Court's opinion indicates that Texas might not constitutionally apply its proscription of abortion as written to a woman in that stage of pregnancy. Nonetheless, the Court uses her complaint against the Texas statute as a fulcrum for deciding that States may *172 impose virtually no restrictions on medical abortions performed during the first trimester of pregnancy. In deciding such a hypothetical lawsuit, the Court departs from the longstanding admonition that it should never ""formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied."" Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S. S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113 U.S. 33, 39 (1885). See also Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 345 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).

II
Even if there were a plaintiff in this case capable of litigating the issue which the Court decides, I would reach a conclusion opposite to that reached by the Court. I have difficulty in concluding, as the Court does, that the right of ""privacy"" is involved in this case. Texas, by the statute here challenged, bars the performance of a medical abortion by a licensed physician on a plaintiff such as Roe. A transaction resulting in an operation such as this is not ""private"" in the ordinary usage of that word. Nor is the ""privacy"" that the Court finds here even a distant relative of the freedom from searches and seizures protected by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which the Court has referred to as embodying a right to privacy. Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967).
If the Court means by the term ""privacy"" no more than that the claim of a person to be free from unwanted state regulation of consensual transactions may be a form of ""liberty"" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, there is no doubt that similar claims have been upheld in our earlier decisions on the basis of that liberty. I agree with the statement of MR. JUSTICE STEWART in his concurring opinion that the ""liberty,"" against deprivation of which without due process the Fourteenth *173 Amendment protects, embraces more than the rights found in the Bill of Rights. But that liberty is not guaranteed absolutely against deprivation, only against deprivation without due process of law. The test traditionally applied in the area of social and economic legislation is whether or not a law such as that challenged has a rational relation to a valid state objective. Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 491 (1955). The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment undoubtedly does place a limit, albeit a broad one, on legislative power to enact laws such as this. If the Texas statute were to prohibit an abortion even where the mother's life is in jeopardy, I have little doubt that such a statute would lack a rational relation to a valid state objective under the test stated in Williamson, supra. But the Court's sweeping invalidation of any restrictions on abortion during the first trimester is impossible to justify under that standard, and the conscious weighing of competing factors that the Court's opinion apparently substitutes for the established test is far more appropriate to a legislative judgment than to a judicial one.
The Court eschews the history of the Fourteenth Amendment in its reliance on the ""compelling state interest"" test. See Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U.S. 164, 179 (1972) (dissenting opinion). But the Court adds a new wrinkle to this test by transposing it from the legal considerations associated with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to this case arising under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Unless I misapprehend the consequences of this transplanting of the ""compelling state interest test,"" the Court's opinion will accomplish the seemingly impossible feat of leaving this area of the law more confused than it found it.
*174 While the Court's opinion quotes from the dissent of Mr. Justice Holmes in Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 74 (1905), the result it reaches is more closely attuned to the majority opinion of Mr. Justice Peckham in that case. As in Lochner and similar cases applying substantive due process standards to economic and social welfare legislation, the adoption of the compelling state interest standard will inevitably require this Court to examine the legislative policies and pass on the wisdom of these policies in the very process of deciding whether a particular state interest put forward may or may not be ""compelling."" The decision here to break pregnancy into three distinct terms and to outline the permissible restrictions the State may impose in each one, for example, partakes more of judicial legislation than it does of a determination of the intent of the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The fact that a majority of the States reflecting, after all, the majority sentiment in those States, have had restrictions on abortions for at least a century is a strong indication, it seems to me, that the asserted right to an abortion is not ""so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental,"" Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 105 (1934). Even today, when society's views on abortion are changing, the very existence of the debate is evidence that the ""right"" to an abortion is not so universally accepted as the appellant would have us believe.
To reach its result, the Court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the Amendment. As early as 1821, the first state law dealing directly with abortion was enacted by the Connecticut Legislature. Conn. Stat., Tit. 22, §§ 14, 16. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth *175 Amendment in 1868, there were at least 36 laws enacted by state or territorial legislatures limiting abortion.[1] While many States have amended or updated *176 their laws, 21 of the laws on the books in 1868 remain in effect today.[2] Indeed, the Texas statute struck down today was, as the majority notes, first enacted in 1857 *177 and ""has remained substantially unchanged to the present time."" Ante, at 119.
There apparently was no question concerning the validity of this provision or of any of the other state statutes when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. The only conclusion possible from this history is that the drafters did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter.

III
Even if one were to agree that the case that the Court decides were here, and that the enunciation of the substantive constitutional law in the Court's opinion were proper, the actual disposition of the case by the Court is still difficult to justify. The Texas statute is struck down in toto, even though the Court apparently concedes that at later periods of pregnancy Texas might impose these selfsame statutory limitations on abortion. My understanding of past practice is that a statute found *178 to be invalid as applied to a particular plaintiff, but not unconstitutional as a whole, is not simply ""struck down"" but is, instead, declared unconstitutional as applied to the fact situation before the Court. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886); Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 576 (1969).
For all of the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.
"
764,Justice Stewart,concurring,False,Roe v. Wade,,1973,2.0,"In 1963, this Court, in Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726, purported to sound the death knell for the doctrine of substantive due process, a doctrine under which many state laws had in the past been held to violate the Fourteenth Amendment. As Mr. Justice Black's opinion for the Court in Skrupa put it: ""We have returned to the original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies, who are elected to pass laws."" Id., at 730.[1]
Barely two years later, in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, the Court held a Connecticut birth control law unconstitutional. In view of what had been so recently said in Skrupa, the Court's opinion in Griswold understandably did its best to avoid reliance on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as the ground for decision. Yet, the Connecticut law did not violate any provision of the Bill of Rights, nor any other specific provision of the Constitution.[2] So it was clear *168 to me then, and it is equally clear to me now, that the Griswold decision can be rationally understood only as a holding that the Connecticut statute substantively invaded the ""liberty"" that is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.[3] As so understood, Griswold stands as one in a long line of pre-Skrupa cases decided under the doctrine of substantive due process, and I now accept it as such.
""In a Constitution for a free people, there can be no doubt that the meaning of `liberty' must be broad indeed."" Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 572. The Constitution nowhere mentions a specific right of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life, but the ""liberty"" protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment covers more than those freedoms explicitly named in the Bill of Rights. See Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U.S. 232, 238-239; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 534-535; Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399-400. Cf. Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 629-630; United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 757-758; Carrington v. Rash, 380 U.S. 89, 96; Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U.S. 500, 505; Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116, 127; Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499-500; Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 41.
*169 As Mr. Justice Harlan once wrote: ""[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This `liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints. . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment."" Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 543 (opinion dissenting from dismissal of appeal) (citations omitted). In the words of Mr. Justice Frankfurter, ""Great concepts like . . . `liberty' . . . were purposely left to gather meaning from experience. For they relate to the whole domain of social and economic fact, and the statesmen who founded this Nation knew too well that only a stagnant society remains unchanged."" National Mutual Ins. Co. v. Tidewater Transfer Co., 337 U.S. 582, 646 (dissenting opinion).
Several decisions of this Court make clear that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12; Griswold v. Connecticut, supra; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra; Meyer v. Nebraska, supra. See also Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166; Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541. As recently as last Term, in Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 453, we recognized ""the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person *170 as the decision whether to bear or beget a child."" That right necessarily includes the right of a woman to decide whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. ""Certainly the interests of a woman in giving of her physical and emotional self during pregnancy and the interests that will be affected throughout her life by the birth and raising of a child are of a far greater degree of significance and personal intimacy than the right to send a child to private school protected in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925), or the right to teach a foreign language protected in Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923)."" Abele v. Markle, 351 F. Supp. 224, 227 (Conn. 1972).
Clearly, therefore, the Court today is correct in holding that the right asserted by Jane Roe is embraced within the personal liberty protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
It is evident that the Texas abortion statute infringes that right directly. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a more complete abridgment of a constitutional freedom than that worked by the inflexible criminal statute now in force in Texas. The question then becomes whether the state interests advanced to justify this abridgment can survive the ""particularly careful scrutiny"" that the Fourteenth Amendment here requires.
The asserted state interests are protection of the health and safety of the pregnant woman, and protection of the potential future human life within her. These are legitimate objectives, amply sufficient to permit a State to regulate abortions as it does other surgical procedures, and perhaps sufficient to permit a State to regulate abortions more stringently or even to prohibit them in the late stages of pregnancy. But such legislation is not before us, and I think the Court today has thoroughly demonstrated that these state interests cannot constitutionally support the broad abridgment of personal *171 liberty worked by the existing Texas law. Accordingly, I join the Court's opinion holding that that law is invalid under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
MR."
12940,Justice Powell,concurring,False,Frontiero v. Richardson,,1973,2.0,"I agree that the challenged statutes constitute an unconstitutional discrimination against servicewomen in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, but I cannot join the opinion of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, which would hold that all classifications based upon sex, ""like classifications based upon race, alienage, and national origin,"" are ""inherently suspect and must therefore be subjected to close judicial scrutiny."" Ante, at 682. It is unnecessary for the Court in this case to *692 characterize sex as a suspect classification, with all of the far-reaching implications of such a holding. Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), which abundantly supports our decision today, did not add sex to the narrowly limited group of classifications which are inherently suspect. In my view, we can and should decide this case on the authority of Reed and reserve for the future any expansion of its rationale.
There is another, and I find compelling, reason for deferring a general categorizing of sex classifications as invoking the strictest test of judicial scrutiny. The Equal Rights Amendment, which if adopted will resolve the substance of this precise question, has been approved by the Congress and submitted for ratification by the States. If this Amendment is duly adopted, it will represent the will of the people accomplished in the manner prescribed by the Constitution. By acting prematurely and unnecessarily, as I view it, the Court has assumed a decisional responsibility at the very time when state legislatures, functioning within the traditional democratic process, are debating the proposed Amendment. It seems to me that this reaching out to pre-empt by judicial action a major political decision which is currently in process of resolution does not reflect appropriate respect for duly prescribed legislative processes.
There are times when this Court, under our system, cannot avoid a constitutional decision on issues which normally should be resolved by the elected representatives of the people. But democratic institutions are weakened, and confidence in the restraint of the Court is impaired, when we appear unnecessarily to decide sensitive issues of broad social and political importance at the very time they are under consideration within the prescribed constitutional processes.
"
12939,Justice Brennan,majority,False,Frontiero v. Richardson,,1973,2.0,"The question before us concerns the right of a female member of the uniformed services[1] to claim her spouse as a ""dependent"" for the purposes of obtaining increased quarters allowances and medical and dental benefits under 37 U.S. C. §§ 401, 403, and 10 U.S. C. §§ 1072, 1076, on an equal footing with male members. Under these statutes, a serviceman may claim his wife as a ""dependent"" without regard to whether she is in fact dependent upon him for any part of her support. 37 U.S. C. § 401 (1); 10 U.S. C. § 1072 (2) (A). A servicewoman, on the other hand, may not claim her husband as a ""dependent"" under these programs unless he is in fact dependent upon her for over one-half of his support. *679 37 U.S. C. § 401; 10 U.S. C. § 1072 (2) (C).[2] Thus, the question for decision is whether this difference in treatment constitutes an unconstitutional discrimination against servicewomen in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. A three-judge District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, one judge dissenting, rejected this contention and sustained the constitutionality of the provisions of the statutes making this distinction. 341 F. Supp. 201 (1972). We noted probable jurisdiction. 409 U.S. 840 (1972). We reverse.

I
In an effort to attract career personnel through reenlistment, Congress established, in 37 U.S. C. § 401 et seq., and 10 U.S. C. § 1071 et seq., a scheme for the provision of fringe benefits to members of the uniformed services on a competitive basis with business and industry.[3] Thus, under 37 U.S. C. § 403, a member of the uniformed services with dependents is entitled to an *680 increased ""basic allowance for quarters"" and, under 10 U.S. C. § 1076, a member's dependents are provided comprehensive medical and dental care.
Appellant Sharron Frontiero, a lieutenant in the United States Air Force, sought increased quarters allowances, and housing and medical benefits for her husband, appellant Joseph Frontiero, on the ground that he was her ""dependent."" Although such benefits would automatically have been granted with respect to the wife of a male member of the uniformed services, appellant's application was denied because she failed to demonstrate that her husband was dependent on her for more than one-half of his support.[4] Appellants then commenced this suit, contending that, by making this distinction, the statutes unreasonably discriminate on the basis of sex in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.[5] In essence, appellants asserted that the discriminatory impact of the statutes is twofold: first, as a procedural matter, a female member is required to demonstrate her spouse's dependency, while no such burden is imposed upon male members; and, second, as a substantive matter, a male member who does not provide more than one-half of his wife's support receives benefits, while a similarly situated female member is denied such benefits. Appellants therefore sought a permanent injunction *681 against the continued enforcement of these statutes and an order directing the appellees to provide Lieutenant Frontiero with the same housing and medical benefits that a similarly situated male member would receive.
Although the legislative history of these statutes sheds virtually no light on the purposes underlying the differential treatment accorded male and female members,[6] a majority of the three-judge District Court surmised that Congress might reasonably have concluded that, since the husband in our society is generally the ""bread-winner"" in the familyand the wife typically the ""dependent"" partner""it would be more economical to require married female members claiming husbands to prove actual dependency than to extend the presumption of dependency to such members."" 341 F. Supp., at 207. Indeed, given the fact that approximately 99% of all members of the uniformed services are male, the District *682 Court speculated that such differential treatment might conceivably lead to a ""considerable saving of administrative expense and manpower."" Ibid.

II
At the outset, appellants contend that classifications based upon sex, like classifications based upon race,[7] alienage,[8] and national origin,[9] are inherently suspect and must therefore be subjected to close judicial scrutiny. We agree and, indeed, find at least implicit support for such an approach in our unanimous decision only last Term in Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971).
In Reed, the Court considered the constitutionality of an Idaho statute providing that, when two individuals are otherwise equally entitled to appointment as administrator of an estate, the male applicant must be preferred to the female. Appellant, the mother of the deceased, and appellee, the father, filed competing petitions for appointment as administrator of their son's estate. Since the parties, as parents of the deceased, were members of the same entitlement class, the statutory preference was invoked and the father's petition was therefore granted. Appellant claimed that this statute, by giving a mandatory preference to males over females without regard to their individual qualifications, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The Court noted that the Idaho statute ""provides that different treatment be accorded to the applicants on the basis of their sex; it thus establishes a classification subject *683 to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause."" 404 U.S., at 75. Under ""traditional"" equal protection analysis, a legislative classification must be sustained unless it is ""patently arbitrary"" and bears no rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest. See Jefferson v. Hackney, 406 U.S. 535, 546 (1972); Richardson v. Belcher, 404 U. S. 78,81 (1971); Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 611 (1960); McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420,426 (1961); Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 485 (1970).
In an effort to meet this standard, appellee contended that the statutory scheme was a reasonable measure designed to reduce the workload on probate courts by eliminating one class of contests. Moreover, appellee argued that the mandatory preference for male applicants was in itself reasonable since ""men [are] as a rule more conversant with business affairs than . . . women.""[10] Indeed, appellee maintained that ""it is a matter of common knowledge, that women still are not engaged in politics, the professions, business or industry to the extent that men are.""[11] And the Idaho Supreme Court, in upholding the constitutionality of this statute, suggested that the Idaho Legislature might reasonably have ""concluded that in general men are better qualified to act as an administrator than are women.""[12]
Despite these contentions, however, the Court held the statutory preference for male applicants unconstitutional. In reaching this result, the Court implicitly rejected appellee's apparently rational explanation of the statutory scheme, and concluded that, by ignoring the individual qualifications of particular applicants, the challenged statute provided ""dissimilar treatment for men and women who are . . . similarly situated."" 404 U. S., *684 at 77. The Court therefore held that, even though the State's interest in achieving administrative efficiency ""is not without some legitimacy,"" ""[t]o give a mandatory preference to members of either sex over members of the other, merely to accomplish the elimination of hearings on the merits, is to make the very kind of arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the [Constitution] . . . ."" Id., at 76. This departure from ""traditional"" rational-basis analysis with respect to sex-based classifications is clearly justified.
There can be no doubt that our Nation has had a long and unfortunate history of sex discrimination.[13] Traditionally, such discrimination was rationalized by an attitude of ""romantic paternalism"" which, in practical effect, put women, not on a pedestal, but in a cage. Indeed, this paternalistic attitude became so firmly rooted in our national consciousness that, 100 years ago, a distinguished Member of this Court was able to proclaim:
""Man is, or should be, woman's protector and defender. The natural and proper timidity and delicacy which belongs to the female sex evidently unfits it for many of the occupations of civil life. The constitution of the family organization, which is founded in the divine ordinance, as well as in the nature of things, indicates the domestic sphere as that which properly belongs to the domain and functions of womanhood. The harmony, not to say identity, of interests and views which belong, or should belong, to the family institution is repugnant to the idea of a woman adopting a distinct and *685 independent career from that of her husband. . . .
"". . . The paramount destiny and mission of woman are to fulfil the noble and benign offices of wife and mother. This is the law of the Creator."" Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130, 141 (1873) (Bradley, J., concurring).
As a result of notions such as these, our statute books gradually became laden with gross, stereotyped distinctions between the sexes and, indeed, throughout much of the 19th century the position of women in our society was, in many respects, comparable to that of blacks under the pre-Civil War slave codes. Neither slaves nor women could hold office, serve on juries, or bring suit in their own names, and married women traditionally were denied the legal capacity to hold or convey property or to serve as legal guardians of their own children. See generally L. Kanowitz, Women and the Law: The Unfinished Revolution 5-6 (1969); G. Myrdal, An American Dilemma 1073 (20th anniversary ed. 1962). And although blacks were guaranteed the right to vote in 1870, women were denied even that rightwhich is itself ""preservative of other basic civil and political rights""[14]until adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment half a century later.
It is true, of course, that the position of women in America has improved markedly in recent decades.[15]*686 Nevertheless, it can hardly be doubted that, in part because of the high visibility of the sex characteristic,[16] women still face pervasive, although at times more subtle, discrimination in our educational institutions, in the job market and, perhaps most conspicuously, in the political arena.[17] See generally K. Amundsen, The Silenced Majority: Women and American Democracy (1971); The President's Task Force on Women's Rights and Responsibilities, A Matter of Simple Justice (1970).
Moreover, since sex, like race and national origin, is an immutable characteristic determined solely by the accident of birth, the imposition of special disabilities upon the members of a particular sex because of their sex would seem to violate ""the basic concept of our system that legal burdens should bear some relationship to individual responsibility . . . ."" Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U.S. 164, 175 (1972). And what differentiates sex from such nonsuspect statuses as intelligence or physical disability, and aligns it with the recognized suspect criteria, is that the sex characteristic frequently bears no relation to ability to perform or contribute to society.[18] As a result, statutory distinctions *687 between the sexes often have the effect of invidiously relegating the entire class of females to inferior legal status without regard to the actual capabilities of its individual members.
We might also note that, over the past decade, Congress has itself manifested an increasing sensitivity to sex-based classifications. In Tit. VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for example, Congress expressly declared that no employer, labor union, or other organization subject to the provisions of the Act shall discriminate against any individual on the basis of ""race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.""[19] Similarly, the Equal Pay Act of 1963 provides that no employer covered by the Act ""shall discriminate . . . between employees on the basis of sex.""[20] And § 1 of the Equal Rights Amendment, passed by Congress on March 22, 1972, and submitted to the legislatures of the States for ratification, declares that ""[e]quality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.""[21] Thus, Congress itself has concluded that classifications based upon sex are inherently invidious, and this conclusion of a coequal *688 branch of Government is not without significance to the question presently under consideration. Cf. Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 240, 248-249 (1970) (opinion of BRENNAN, WHITE, and MARSHALL, JJ.); Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 648-649 (1966).
With these considerations in mind, we can only conclude that classifications based upon sex, like classifications based upon race, alienage, or national origin, are inherently suspect, and must therefore be subjected to strict judicial scrutiny. Applying the analysis mandated by that stricter standard of review, it is clear that the statutory scheme now before us is constitutionally invalid.

III
The sole basis of the classification established in the challenged statutes is the sex of the individuals involved. Thus, under 37 U.S. C. §§ 401, 403, and 10 U.S. C. §§ 1072, 1076, a female member of the uniformed services seeking to obtain housing and medical benefits for her spouse must prove his dependency in fact, whereas no such burden is imposed upon male members. In addition, the statutes operate so as to deny benefits to a female member, such as appellant Sharron Frontiero, who provides less than one-half of her spouse's support, while at the same time granting such benefits to a male member who likewise provides less than one-half of his spouse's support. Thus, to this extent at least, it may fairly be said that these statutes command ""dissimilar treatment for men and women who are . . . similarly situated."" Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S., at 77.
Moreover, the Government concedes that the differential treatment accorded men and women under these statutes serves no purpose other than mere ""administrative convenience."" In essence, the Government maintains that, as an empirical matter, wives in our society frequently are dependent upon their husbands, while husbands *689 rarely are dependent upon their wives. Thus, the Government argues that Congress might reasonably have concluded that it would be both cheaper and easier simply conclusively to presume that wives of male members are financially dependent upon their husbands, while burdening female members with the task of establishing dependency in fact.[22]
The Government offers no concrete evidence, however, tending to support its view that such differential treatment in fact saves the Government any money. In order to satisfy the demands of strict judicial scrutiny, the Government must demonstrate, for example, that it is actually cheaper to grant increased benefits with respect to all male members, than it is to determine which male members are in fact entitled to such benefits and to grant increased benefits only to those members whose wives actually meet the dependency requirement. Here, however, there is substantial evidence that, if put to the test, many of the wives of male members would fail to qualify for benefits.[23] And in light of the fact that the *690 dependency determination with respect to the husbands of female members is presently made solely on the basis of affidavits, rather than through the more costly hearing process,[24] the Government's explanation of the statutory scheme is, to say the least, questionable.
In any case, our prior decisions make clear that, although efficacious administration of governmental programs is not without some importance, ""the Constitution recognizes higher values than speed and efficiency."" Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 656 (1972). And when we enter the realm of ""strict judicial scrutiny,"" there can be no doubt that ""administrative convenience"" is not a shibboleth, the mere recitation of which dictates constitutionality. See Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618 (1969); Carrington v. Rash, 380 U.S. 89 (1965). On the contrary, any statutory scheme which draws a sharp line between the sexes, solely for the purpose of achieving administrative convenience, necessarily commands ""dissimilar treatment for men and women who are . . . similarly situated,"" and therefore involves the ""very kind of arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the [Constitution]. . . ."" Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S., at 77, 76. We therefore conclude that, by according differential treatment to male and female members of the uniformed services for the sole purpose of achieving administrative *691 convenience, the challenged statutes violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment insofar as they require a female member to prove the dependency of her husband.[25]
Reversed.

34735,Justice Brennan,dissenting,False,Kahn v. Shevin,,1974,1.0,"The Court rejects widower Kahn's claim of denial of equal protection on the ground that the limitation in Fla. Stat. § 196.191 (7) (1971), which provides an annual $500 property tax exemption to widows, is a legislative classification that bears a fair and substantial relation to ""the state policy of cushioning the financial impact of spousal loss upon the sex for which that loss imposes a disproportionately heavy burden."" Ante, at 355. In my view, however, a legislative classification that distinguishes potential beneficiaries solely by reference to their gender-based status as widows or widowers, like classifications based upon race,[1] alienage,[2] and national origin,[3] must be subjected to close judicial scrutiny, because it focuses upon generally immutable characteristics over which individuals have little or no control, and also because gender-based classifications too often have been inexcusably utilized to stereotype and stigmatize politically powerless segments of society. See Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973). The Court is not, therefore, free to sustain the statute on the ground that it rationally promotes legitimate governmental interests; rather, such suspect classifications can be sustained only when the State bears the burden of demonstrating that the challenged legislation serves overriding or compelling interests that cannot be achieved either by a more carefully tailored legislative classification or by the use of feasible, *358 less drastic means. While, in my view, the statute serves a compelling governmental interest by ""cushioning the financial impact of spousal loss upon the sex for which that loss imposes a disproportionately heavy burden,"" I think that the statute is invalid because the State's interest can be served equally well by a more narrowly drafted statute.
Gender-based classifications cannot be sustained merely because they promote legitimate governmental interests, such as efficacious administration of government. Frontiero v. Richardson, supra; Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971). For ""when we enter the realm of `strict judicial scrutiny,' there can be no doubt that `administrative convenience' is not a shibboleth, the mere recitation of which dictates constitutionality. See Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618 (1969); Carrington v. Rash, 380 U.S. 89 (1965). On the contrary, any statutory scheme which draws a sharp line between the sexes, solely for the purpose of achieving administrative convenience, necessarily commands `dissimilar treatment for men and women who are . . . similarly situated,' and therefore involves the `very kind of arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the [Constitution] . . . .' Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S., at 77, 76."" Frontiero v. Richardson, supra, at 690. But Florida's justification of § 196.191 (7) is not that it serves administrative convenience or helps to preserve the public fisc. Rather, the asserted justification is that § 196.191 (7) is an affirmative step toward alleviating the effects of past economic discrimination against women.[4]
I agree that, in providing special benefits for a needy segment of society long the victim of purposeful discrimination *359 and neglect, the statute serves the compelling state interest of achieving equality for such groups.[5] No one familiar with this country's history of pervasive sex discrimination against women[6] can doubt the need for remedial measures to correct the resulting economic imbalances. Indeed, the extent of the economic disparity between men and women is dramatized by the data cited by the Court, ante, at 353-354. By providing a property tax exemption for widows, § 196.191 (7) assists in reducing that economic disparity for a class of women particularly disadvantaged by the legacy of economic discrimination.[7] In that circumstance, the purpose and effect of the suspect classification are ameliorative; the statute neither stigmatizes nor denigrates widowers not also benefited by the legislation. Moreover, inclusion of needy widowers within the class of beneficiaries would *360 not further the State's overriding interest in remedying the economic effects of past sex discrimination for needy victims of that discrimination. While doubtless some widowers are in financial need, no one suggests that such need results from sex discrimination as in the case of widows.
The statute nevertheless fails to satisfy the requirements of equal protection, since the State has not borne its burden of proving that its compelling interest could not be achieved by a more precisely tailored statute or by use of feasible, less drastic means. Section 196.191 (7) is plainly overinclusive, for the $500 property tax exemption may be obtained by a financially independent heiress as well as by an unemployed widow with dependent children. The State has offered nothing to explain why inclusion of widows of substantial economic means was necessary to advance the State's interest in ameliorating the effects of past economic discrimination against women.
Moreover, alternative means of classification, narrowing the class of widow beneficiaries, appear readily available. The exemption is granted only to widows who complete and file with the tax assessor a form application establishing their status as widows. By merely redrafting that form to exclude widows who earn annual incomes, or possess assets, in excess of specified amounts, the State could readily narrow the class of beneficiaries to those widows for whom the effects of past economic discrimination against women have been a practical reality.

30056,Justice Stewart,majority,False,Geduldig v. Aiello,,1974,1.0,"For almost 30 years California has administered a disability insurance system that pays benefits to persons in private employment who are temporarily unable to work because of disability not covered by workmen's compensation. The appellees brought this action to challenge the constitutionality of a provision of the California program that, in defining ""disability,"" excludes from coverage certain disabilities resulting from pregnancy. Because the appellees sought to enjoin the enforcement of this state statute, a three-judge court was convened pursuant to 28 U.S. C. §§ 2281 and 2284.[1] On *487 the appellees' motion for summary judgment, the District Court, by a divided vote, held that this provision of the disability insurance program violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and therefore enjoined its continued enforcement. 359 F. Supp. 792. The District Court denied a motion to stay its judgment pending appeal. The appellant thereupon filed a similar motion in this Court, which we granted. 414 U.S. 897. We subsequently noted probable jurisdiction of the appeal. 414 U.S. 1110.

I
California's disability insurance system is funded entirely from contributions deducted from the wages of participating employees. Participation in the program is mandatory unless the employees are protected by a voluntary private plan approved by the State.[2] Each employee is required to contribute one percent of his salary, up to an annual maximum of $85.[3] These contributions are placed in the Unemployment Compensation Disability Fund, which is established and administered as a special trust fund within the state treasury.[4] It is from this Disability Fund that benefits under the program are paid.
An individual is eligible for disability benefits if, during a one-year base period prior to his disability, he has contributed one percent of a minimum income of $300 to the Disability Fund.[5] In the event he suffers a compensable disability, the individual can receive a ""weekly benefit amount"" of between $25 and $105, depending on the amount he earned during the highest quarter of the *488 base period.[6] Benefits are not paid until the eighth day of disability, unless the employee is hospitalized, in which case benefits commence on the first day of hospitalization.[7] In addition to the ""weekly benefit amount,"" a hospitalized employee is entitled to receive ""additional benefits"" of $12 per day of hospitalization.[8] ""Weekly benefit amounts"" for any one disability are payable for 26 weeks so long as the total amount paid does not exceed one-half of the wages received during the base period.[9] ""Additional benefits"" for any one disability are paid for a maximum of 20 days.[10]
In return for his one-percent contribution to the Disability Fund, the individual employee is insured against the risk of disability stemming from a substantial number of ""mental or physical illness[es] and mental or physical injur[ies]."" Cal. Unemp. Ins. Code § 2626. It is not every disabling condition, however, that triggers the obligation to pay benefits under the program. As already noted, for example, any disability of less than eight days' duration is not compensable, except when the employee is hospitalized. Conversely, no benefits are payable for any single disability beyond 26 weeks. Further, disability is not compensable if it results from the individual's court commitment as a dipsomaniac, drug addict, or sexual psychopath.[11] Finally, § 2626 of the Unemployment *489 Insurance Code excludes from coverage certain disabilities that are attributable to pregnancy. It is this provision that is at issue in the present case.
Appellant is the Director of the California Department of Human Resources Development.[12] He is responsible for the administration of the State's disability insurance program. Appellees are four women who have paid sufficient amounts into the Disability Fund to be eligible for benefits under the program. Each of the appellees became pregnant and suffered employment disability as a result of her pregnancy. With respect to three of the appellees, Carolyn Aiello, Augustina Armendariz, and Elizabeth Johnson, the disabilities were attributable to abnormal complications encountered during their pregnancies.[13] The fourth, Jacqueline Jaramillo, experienced a normal pregnancy, which was the sole cause of her disability.
At all times relevant to this case, § 2626 of the Unemployment Insurance Code provided:
"" `Disability' or `disabled' includes both mental or physical illness and mental or physical injury. An individual shall be deemed disabled in any day in which, because of his physical or mental condition, he is unable to perform his regular or customary work. In no case shall the term `disability' or `disabled' include any injury or illness caused by or arising in connection with pregnancy up to the termination of such pregnancy and for a period of 28 days thereafter."" (Emphasis added.)
*490 Appellant construed and applied the final sentence of this statute to preclude the payment of benefits for any disability resulting from pregnancy. As a result, the appellees were ruled ineligible for disability benefits by reason of this provision, and they sued to enjoin its enforcement. The District Court, finding ""that the exclusion of pregnancy-related disabilities is not based upon a classification having a rational and substantial relationship to a legitimate state purpose,"" held that the exclusion was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause. 359 F. Supp., at 801.
Shortly before the District Court's decision in this case, the California Court of Appeal, in a suit brought by a woman who suffered an ectopic pregnancy, held that § 2626 does not bar the payment of benefits on account of disability that results from medical complications arising during pregnancy. Rentzer v. Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, 32 Cal. App. 3d 604, 108 Cal. Rptr. 336 (1973).[14] The state court construed the statute to preclude only the payment of benefits for disability accompanying normal pregnancy.[15] The appellant *491 acquiesced in this construction and issued administrative guidelines that exclude only the payment of ""maternity benefits""i. e., hospitalization and disability benefits for normal delivery and recuperation.
Although Rentzer was decided some 10 days before the District Court's decision in this case, there was apparently no opportunity to call the court's attention to it. The appellant, therefore, asked the court to reconsider its decision in light of the construction that the California Court of Appeal had given to § 2626 in the Rentzer case. By a divided vote, the court denied the motion for reconsideration. Although a more definitive ruling would surely have been preferable, we interpret the District Court's denial of the appellant's motion as a determination that its decision was not affected by the limiting construction given to § 2626 in Rentzer.
Because of the Rentzer decision and the revised administrative guidelines that resulted from it, the appellees Aiello, Armendariz, and Johnson, whose disabilities were attributable to causes other than normal pregnancy and delivery, became entitled to benefits under the disability insurance program, and their claims have since been paid. With respect to appellee Jaramillo, however, whose disability stemmed solely from normal pregnancy and childbirth, § 2626 continues to bar the *492 payment of any benefits. It is evident that only Jaramillo continues to have a live controversy with the appellant as to the validity of § 2626. The claims of the other appellees have been mooted by the change that Rentzer worked in the construction and application of that provision. Thus, the issue before the Court on this appeal is whether the California disability insurance program invidiously discriminates against Jaramillo and others similarly situated by not paying insurance benefits for disability that accompanies normal pregnancy and childbirth.

II
It is clear that California intended to establish this benefit system as an insurance program that was to function essentially in accordance with insurance concepts.[16] Since the program was instituted in 1946, it has been totally self-supporting, never drawing on general state revenues to finance disability or hospital benefits. The Disability Fund is wholly supported by the one percent of wages annually contributed by participating employees. At oral argument, counsel for the appellant informed us that in recent years between 90% and *493 103% of the revenue to the Disability Fund has been paid out in disability and hospital benefits. This history strongly suggests that the one-percent contribution rate, in addition to being easily computable, bears a close and substantial relationship to the level of benefits payable and to the disability risks insured under the program.
Over the years California has demonstrated a strong commitment not to increase the contribution rate above the one-percent level. The State has sought to provide the broadest possible disability protection that would be affordable by all employees, including those with very low incomes. Because any larger percentage or any flat dollar-amount rate of contribution would impose an increasingly regressive levy bearing most heavily upon those with the lowest incomes, the State has resisted any attempt to change the required contribution from the one-percent level. The program is thus structured, in terms of the level of benefits and the risks insured, to maintain the solvency of the Disability Fund at a one-percent annual level of contribution.[17]
In ordering the State to pay benefits for disability accompanying normal pregnancy and delivery, the District Court acknowledged the State's contention ""that coverage of these disabilities is so extraordinarily expensive that it would be impossible to maintain a program supported by employee contributions if these disabilities are included."" 359 F. Supp., at 798. There is considerable disagreement between the parties with respect to how great the increased costs would actually be, but they *494 would clearly be substantial.[18] For purposes of analysis the District Court accepted the State's estimate, which was in excess of $100 million annually, and stated: ""[I]t is clear that including these disabilities would not destroy the program. The increased costs could be accommodated quite easily by making reasonable changes in the contribution rate, the maximum benefits allowable, and the other variables affecting the solvency of the program."" Ibid.
Each of these ""variables""the benefit level deemed appropriate to compensate employee disability, the risks selected to be insured under the program, and the contribution rate chosen to maintain the solvency of the program and at the same time to permit low-income employees to participate with minimal personal sacrifice represents a policy determination by the State. The essential issue in this case is whether the Equal Protection Clause requires such policies to be sacrificed or compromised in order to finance the payment of benefits to those whose disability is attributable to normal pregnancy and delivery.
We cannot agree that the exclusion of this disability from coverage amounts to invidious discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause. California does not discriminate with respect to the persons or groups which are eligible for disability insurance protection under the program. The classification challenged in this case relates to the asserted underinclusiveness of the set of risks that the State has selected to insure. Although California has created a program to insure most risks of employment *495 disability, it has not chosen to insure all such risks, and this decision is reflected in the level of annual contributions exacted from participating employees. This Court has held that, consistently with the Equal Protection Clause, a State ""may take one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind. . . . The legislature may select one phase of one field and apply a remedy there, neglecting the others. . . ."" Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 489 (1955); Jefferson v. Hackney, 406 U.S. 535 (1972). Particularly with respect to social welfare programs, so long as the line drawn by the State is rationally supportable, the courts will not interpose their judgment as to the appropriate stopping point. ""[T]he Equal Protection Clause does not require that a State must choose between attacking every aspect of a problem or not attacking the problem at all."" Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 486-487 (1970).
The District Court suggested that moderate alterations in what it regarded as ""variables"" of the disability insurance program could be made to accommodate the substantial expense required to include normal pregnancy within the program's protection. The same can be said, however, with respect to the other expensive class of disabilities that are excluded from coverageshort-term disabilities. If the Equal Protection Clause were thought to compel disability payments for normal pregnancy, it is hard to perceive why it would not also compel payments for short-term disabilities suffered by participating employees.[19]
It is evident that a totally comprehensive program would be substantially more costly than the present program and would inevitably require state subsidy, a higher *496 rate of employee contribution, a lower scale of benefits for those suffering insured disabilities, or some combination of these measures. There is nothing in the Constitution, however, that requires the State to subordinate or compromise its legitimate interests solely to create a more comprehensive social insurance program than it already has.
The State has a legitimate interest in maintaining the self-supporting nature of its insurance program. Similarly, it has an interest in distributing the available resources in such a way as to keep benefit payments at an adequate level for disabilities that are covered, rather than to cover all disabilities inadequately. Finally, California has a legitimate concern in maintaining the contribution rate at a level that will not unduly burden participating employees, particularly low-income employees who may be most in need of the disability insurance.
These policies provide an objective and wholly non-invidious basis for the State's decision not to create a more comprehensive insurance program than it has. There is no evidence in the record that the selection of the risks insured by the program worked to discriminate against any definable group or class in terms of the aggregate risk protection derived by that group or class from the program.[20] There is no risk from which men are protected *497 and women are not. Likewise, there is no risk from which women are protected and men are not.[21]
The appellee simply contends that, although she has received insurance protection equivalent to that provided all other participating employees, she has suffered discrimination because she encountered a risk that was outside the program's protection. For the reasons we have stated, we hold that this contention is not a valid one under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The stay heretofore issued by the Court is vacated, and the judgment of the District Court is
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR."
30057,Justice Brennan,dissenting,False,Geduldig v. Aiello,,1974,1.0,"Relying upon Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471 (1970), and Jefferson v. Hackney, 406 U.S. 535 (1972), *498 the Court today rejects appellees' equal protection claim and upholds the exclusion of normal-pregnancy-related disabilities from coverage under California's disability insurance program on the ground that the legislative classification rationally promotes the State's legitimate cost-saving interests in ""maintaining the self-supporting nature of its insurance program[,] . . . distributing the available resources in such a way as to keep benefit payments at an adequate level for disabilities that are covered,. . . [and] maintaining the contribution rate at a level that will not unduly burden participating employees. . . ."" Ante, at 496. Because I believe that Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), and Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973), mandate a stricter standard of scrutiny which the State's classification fails to satisfy, I respectfully dissent.
California's disability insurance program was enacted to supplement the State's unemployment insurance and workmen's compensation programs by providing benefits to wage earners to cushion the economic effects of income loss and medical expenses resulting from sickness or injury. The legislature's intent in enacting the program was expressed clearly in § 2601 of the Unemployment Insurance Code:
""The purpose of this part is to compensate in part for the wage loss sustained by individuals unemployed because of sickness or injury and to reduce to a minimum the suffering caused by unemployment resulting therefrom. This part shall be construed liberally in aid of its declared purpose to mitigate the evils and burdens which fall on the unemployed and disabled worker and his family.""
To achieve the Act's broad humanitarian goals, the legislature fashioned a pooled-risk disability fund covering *499 all employees at the same rate of contribution,[1] regardless of individual risk.[2] The only requirement that must be satisfied before an employee becomes eligible to receive disability benefits is that the employee must have contributed one percent of a minimum income of $300 during a one-year base period. Cal. Unemp. Ins. Code § 2652. The ""basic benefits,"" varying from $25 to $119 per week, depending upon the employee's base-period earnings, begin on the eighth day of disability or on the first day of hospitalization. §§ 2655, 2627 (b), 2802. Benefits are payable for a maximum of 26 weeks, but may not exceed one-half of the employee's total base-period earnings. § 2653. Finally, compensation is paid for virtually all disabling conditions without regard to cost, voluntariness, uniqueness, predictability, or ""normalcy"" of the disability.[3] Thus, for example, workers are compensated for costly disabilities such as heart attacks, voluntary disabilities such as cosmetic surgery *500 or sterilization, disabilities unique to sex or race such as prostatectomies or sickle-cell anemia, pre-existing conditions inevitably resulting in disability such as degenerative arthritis or cataracts, and ""normal"" disabilities such as removal of irritating wisdom teeth or other orthodontia.
Despite the Code's broad goals and scope of coverage, compensation is denied for disabilities suffered in connection with a ""normal"" pregnancydisabilities suffered only by women. Cal. Unemp. Ins. Code §§ 2626, 2626.2 (Supp. 1974). Disabilities caused by pregnancy, however, like other physically disabling conditions covered by the Code, require medical care, often include hospitalization, anesthesia and surgical procedures, and may involve genuine risk to life.[4] Moreover, the economic effects *501 caused by pregnancy-related disabilities are functionally indistinguishable from the effects caused by any other disability: wages are lost due to a physical inability to work, and medical expenses are incurred for the delivery of the child and for postpartum care.[5] In my view, by singling out for less favorable treatment a gender-linked disability peculiar to women, the State has created a double standard for disability compensation: a limitation is imposed upon the disabilities for which women workers may recover, while men receive full compensation for all disabilities suffered, including those that affect only or primarily their sex, such as prostatectomies, circumcision, hemophilia, and gout. In effect, one set of rules is applied to females and another to males. Such dissimilar treatment of men and women, on the basis of physical characteristics inextricably linked to one sex, inevitably constitutes sex discrimination.
The same conclusion has been reached by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency charged with enforcement of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, 42 U.S. C. § 2000e et seq. (1970 ed., Supp. II), which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sex. In guidelines issued pursuant to Title VII and designed to prohibit the disparate *502 treatment of pregnancy disabilities in the employment context,[6] the EEOC has declared:
""Disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, childbirth, and recovery therefrom are, for all job-related purposes, temporary disabilities and should be treated as such under any health or temporary disability insurance or sick leave plan available in connection with employment. Written and unwritten employment policies and practices involving matters such as the commencement and duration of leave, the availability of extensions, the accrual of seniority and other benefits and privileges, reinstatement, and payment under any health or temporary disability insurance or sick leave plan, formal or informal, shall be applied to disability due to pregnancy or childbirth on the same terms and conditions as they are applied to other temporary disabilities."" 29 CFR § 1604.10 (b).[7]
In the past, when a legislative classification has turned on gender, the Court has justifiably applied a standard of judicial scrutiny more strict than that generally accorded economic or social welfare programs. Compare *503 Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), and Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973), with Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471 (1970), and Jefferson v. Hackney, 406 U.S. 535 (1972). Yet, by its decision today, the Court appears willing to abandon that higher standard of review without satisfactorily explaining what differentiates the gender-based classification employed in this case from those found unconstitutional in Reed and Frontiero. The Court's decision threatens to return men and women to a time when ""traditional"" equal protection analysis sustained legislative classifications that treated differently members of a particular sex solely because of their sex. See, e. g., Muller v. Oregon, 208 U.S. 412 (1908); Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U.S. 464 (1948); Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U.S. 57 (1961).
I cannot join the Court's apparent retreat. I continue to adhere to my view that ""classifications based upon sex, like classifications based upon race, alienage, or national origin, are inherently suspect, and must therefore be subjected to strict judicial scrutiny."" Frontiero v. Richardson, supra, at 688. When, as in this case, the State employs a legislative classification that distinguishes between beneficiaries solely by reference to gender-linked disability risks, ""[t]he Court is not . . . free to sustain the statute on the ground that it rationally promotes legitimate governmental interests; rather, such suspect classifications can be sustained only when the State bears the burden of demonstrating that the challenged legislation serves overriding or compelling interests that cannot be achieved either by a more carefully tailored legislative classification or by the use of feasible, less drastic means."" Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U.S. 351, 357-358 (1974) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).
The State has clearly failed to meet that burden in the present case. The essence of the State's justification for *504 excluding disabilities caused by a normal pregnancy from its disability compensation scheme is that covering such disabilities would be too costly. To be sure, as presently funded, inclusion of normal pregnancies ""would be substantially more costly than the present program.""[8]Ante, at 495. The present level of benefits for insured disabilities could not be maintained without increasing the employee contribution rate, raising or lifting the yearly contribution ceiling, or securing state subsidies. But whatever role such monetary considerations may play in traditional equal protection analysis, the State's interest in preserving the fiscal integrity of its disability insurance program simply cannot render the State's use of a suspect classification constitutional. For while ""a State has a valid interest in preserving the fiscal integrity of its programs[,] . . . a State may not accomplish such a purpose by invidious distinctions between classes of its citizens. . . . The saving of welfare costs cannot justify an otherwise invidious classification."" Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 633 (1969). Thus, when a statutory classification is subject to strict judicial scrutiny, the State ""must do more than show that denying [benefits to the excluded class] saves money."" Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, 415 U.S. 250, 263 (1974). See also Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 374-375 (1971).[9]
*505 Moreover, California's legitimate interest in fiscal integrity could easily have been achieved through a variety of less drastic, sexually neutral means. As the District Court observed:
""Even using [the State's] estimate of the cost of expanding the program to include pregnancy-related disabilities, however, it is clear that including these disabilities would not destroy the program. The increased costs could be accommodated quite easily by making reasonable changes in the contribution rate, the maximum benefits allowable, and the other variables affecting the solvency of the program. For example, the entire cost increase estimated by defendant could be met by requiring workers to contribute an additional amount of approximately .364 percent of their salary and increasing the maximum annual contribution to about $119."" 359 F. Supp. 792, 798.
I would therefore affirm the judgment of the District Court.
"
34219,Justice Marshall,majority,False,Corning Glass Works v. Brennan,,1974,2.0,"These cases arise under the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 77 Stat. 56, § 3, 29 U.S. C. § 206 (d) (1),[1] which added to § 6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 the principle of equal pay for equal work regardless of sex. The principal question posed is whether Corning Glass Works violated the Act by paying a higher base wage to male night shift inspectors than it paid to female inspectors performing the same tasks on the day shift, where the higher wage was paid in addition to a separate night shift differential paid to all employees for night work. In No. 73-29, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in a case involving several Corning plants in Corning, New York, held that this practice violated *191 the Act. 474 F.2d 226 (1973). In No. 73-695, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in a case involving a Corning plant in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, reached the opposite conclusion. 480 F.2d 1254 (1973). We granted certiorari and consolidated the cases to resolve this unusually direct conflict between two circuits. 414 U.S. 1110 (1973). Finding ourselves in substantial agreement with the analysis of the Second Circuit, we affirm in No. 73-29 and reverse in No. 73-695.

I
Prior to 1925, Corning operated its plants in Wellsboro and Corning only during the day, and all inspection work was performed by women. Between 1925 and 1930, the company began to introduce automatic production equipment which made it desirable to institute a night shift. During this period, however, both New York and Pennsylvania law prohibited women from working at night.[2] As a result, in order to fill inspector positions on the new night shift, the company had to recruit male employees from among its male dayworkers. The male employees so transferred demanded and received wages substantially higher than those paid to women inspectors engaged on the two day shifts.[3] During this same period, however, *192 no plant-wide shift differential existed and male employees working at night, other than inspectors, received the same wages as their day shift counterparts. Thus a situation developed where the night inspectors were all male,[4] the day inspectors all female, and the male inspectors received significantly higher wages.
In 1944, Corning plants at both locations were organized by a labor union and a collective-bargaining agreement was negotiated for all production and maintenance employees. This agreement for the first time established a plant-wide shift differential,[5] but this change did not eliminate the higher base wage paid to male night inspectors. Rather, the shift differential was superimposed on the existing difference in base wages between male night inspectors and female day inspectors.
Prior to June 11, 1964, the effective date of the Equal Pay Act,[6] the law in both Pennsylvania and New York *193 was amended to permit women to work at night.[7] It was not until some time after the effective date of the Act, however, that Corning initiated efforts to eliminate *194 the differential rates for male and female inspectors. Beginning in June 1966, Corning started to open up jobs on the night shift to women. Previously separate male and female seniority lists were consolidated and women became eligible to exercise their seniority, on the same basis as men, to bid for the higher paid night inspection jobs as vacancies occurred.
On January 20, 1969, a new collective-bargaining agreement went into effect, establishing a new ""job evaluation"" system for setting wage rates. The new agreement abolished for the future the separate base wages for day and night shift inspectors and imposed a uniform base wage for inspectors exceeding the wage rate for the night shift previously in effect. All inspectors hired after January 20, 1969, were to receive the same base wage, whatever their sex or shift. The collective-bargaining agreement further provided, however, for a higher ""red circle"" rate for employees hired prior to January 20, 1969, when working as inspectors on the night shift. This ""red circle"" rate served essentially to perpetuate the differential in base wages between day and night inspectors.
The Secretary of Labor brought these cases to enjoin Corning from violating the Equal Pay Act[8] and to collect back wages allegedly due female employees because of past violations. Three distinct questions are presented: *195 (1) Did Corning ever violate the Equal Pay Act by paying male night shift inspectors more than female day shift inspectors? (2) If so, did Corning cure its violation of the Act in 1966 by permitting women to work as night shift inspectors? (3) Finally, if the violation was not remedied in 1966, did Corning cure its violation in 1969 by equalizing day and night inspector wage rates but establishing higher ""red circle"" rates for existing employees working on the night shift?

II
Congress' purpose in enacting the Equal Pay Act was to remedy what was perceived to be a serious and endemic problem of employment discrimination in private industry the fact that the wage structure of ""many segments of American industry has been based on an ancient but outmoded belief that a man, because of his role in society, should be paid more than a woman even though his duties are the same."" S. Rep. No. 176, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1963). The solution adopted was quite simple in principle: to require that ""equal work will be rewarded by equal wages."" Ibid.
The Act's basic structure and operation are similarly straightforward. In order to make out a case under the Act, the Secretary must show that an employer pays different wages to employees of opposite sexes ""for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions."" Although the Act is silent on this point, its legislative history makes plain that the Secretary has the burden of proof on this issue,[9] as both of the courts below recognized.[10]
*196 The Act also establishes four exceptionsthree specific and one a general catchall provisionwhere different payment to employees of opposite sexes ""is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex."" Again, while the Act is silent on this question, its structure and history also suggest that once the Secretary has carried his burden of showing that the employer pays workers of one sex more than workers of the opposite sex for equal work, the burden shifts to the employer to show that the differential is justified under one of the Act's four exceptions. All of the many lower courts that have considered this question have so held,[11] and this view is consistent with the general rule that the application of an exemption under the Fair Labor *197 Standards Act is a matter of affirmative defense on which the employer has the burden of proof.[12]
The contentions of the parties in this case reflect the Act's underlying framework. Corning argues that the Secretary has failed to prove that Corning ever violated the Act because day shift work is not ""performed under similar working conditions"" as night shift work. The Secretary maintains that day shift and night shift work are performed under ""similar working conditions"" within the meaning of the Act.[13] Although the Secretary recognizes that higher wages may be paid for night shift work, the Secretary contends that such a shift differential would be based upon a ""factor other than sex"" within the catchall exception to the Act and that Corning has failed to carry its burden of proof that its higher base wage for male night inspectors was in fact based on any factor other than sex.
The courts below relied in part on conflicting statements in the legislative history having some bearing on *198 this question of statutory construction. The Third Circuit found particularly significant a statement of Congressman Goodell, a sponsor of the Equal Pay bill, who, in the course of explaining the bill on the floor of the House, commented that ""standing as opposed to sitting, pleasantness or unpleasantness of surroundings, periodic rest periods, hours of work, difference in shift, all would logically fall within the working condition factor."" 109 Cong. Rec. 9209 (1963) (emphasis added). The Second Circuit, in contrast, relied on a statement from the House Committee Report which, in describing the broad general exception for differentials ""based on any other factor other than sex,"" stated: ""Thus, among other things, shift differentials . . . would also be excluded. . . ."" H. R. Rep. No. 309, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1963).
We agree with Judge Friendly, however, that in this case a better understanding of the phrase ""performed under similar working conditions"" can be obtained from a consideration of the way in which Congress arrived at the statutory language than from trying to reconcile or establish preferences between the conflicting interpretations of the Act by individual legislators or the committee reports. As Mr. Justice Frankfurter remarked in an earlier case involving interpretation of the Fair Labor Standards Act, ""regard for the specific history of the legislative process that culminated in the Act now before us affords more solid ground for giving it appropriate meaning."" United States v. Universal C. I. T. Credit Corp., 344 U.S. 218, 222 (1952).
The most notable feature of the history of the Equal Pay Act is that Congress recognized early in the legislative process that the concept of equal pay for equal work was more readily stated in principle than reduced to statutory language which would be meaningful to employers and workable across the broad range of industries covered *199 by the Act. As originally introduced, the Equal Pay bill required equal pay for ""equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skills."" There were only two exceptionsfor differentials ""made pursuant to a seniority or merit increase system which does not discriminate on the basis of sex. . . .""[14]
In both the House and Senate committee hearings, witnesses were highly critical of the Act's definition of equal work and of its exemptions. Many noted that most of American industry used formal, systematic job evaluation plans to establish equitable wage structures in their plants.[15] Such systems, as explained coincidentally by a representative of Corning Glass Works who testified at both hearings, took into consideration four separate factors in determining job valueskill, effort, responsibility and working conditionsand each of these four components was further systematically divided into various subcomponents.[16] Under a job evaluation plan, point values are assigned to each of the subcomponents of a given job, resulting in a total point figure representing a relatively objective measure of the job's value.
In comparison to the rather complex job evaluation plans used by industry, the definition of equal work used in the first drafts of the Equal Pay bill was criticized as *200 unduly vague and incomplete. Industry representatives feared that as a result of the bill's definition of equal work, the Secretary of Labor would be cast in the position of second-guessing the validity of a company's job evaluation system. They repeatedly urged that the bill be amended to include an exception for job classification systems, or otherwise to incorporate the language of job evaluation into the bill.[17] Thus Corning's own representative testified:
""Job evaluation is an accepted and tested method of attaining equity in wage relationship.
""A great part of industry is committed to job evaluation by past practice and by contractual agreement as the basis for wage administration.
"" `Skill' alone, as a criterion, fails to recognize other aspects of the job situation that affect job worth.
""We sincerely hope that this committee in passing legislation to eliminate wage differences based on sex alone, will recognize in its language the general role of job evaluation in establishing equitable rate relationship.""[18]
We think it plain that in amending the bill's definition of equal work to its present form, the Congress acted in direct response to these pleas. Spokesmen for the amended bill stated, for example, during the House debates:
""The concept of equal pay for jobs demanding equal skill has been expanded to require also equal effort, responsibility, and similar working conditions. These factors are the core of all job classification *201 systems. They form a legitimate basis for differentials in pay.""[19]
Indeed, the most telling evidence of congressional intent is the fact that the Act's amended definition of equal work incorporated the specific language of the job evaluation plan described at the hearings by Corning's own representative that is, the concepts of ""skill,"" ""effort,"" ""responsibility,"" and ""working conditions.""
Congress' intent, as manifested in this history, was to use these terms to incorporate into the new federal Act the well-defined and well-accepted principles of job evaluation so as to ensure that wage differentials based upon bona fide job evaluation plans would be outside the purview of the Act. The House Report emphasized:
""This language recognizes that there are many factors which may be used to measure the relationships between jobs and which establish a valid basis for a difference in pay. These factors will be found in a majority of the job classification systems. Thus, it is anticipated that a bona fide job classification program that does not discriminate on the basis of sex will serve as a valid defense to a charge of discrimination."" H. R. Rep. No. 309, supra, at 3.
It is in this light that the phrase ""working conditions"" must be understood, for where Congress has used technical words or terms of art, ""it [is] proper to explain them by reference to the art or science to which they [are] appropriate."" Greenleaf v. Goodrich, 101 U.S. 278, 284 (1880). See also NLRB v. Highland Park Mfg. Co., 341 U.S. 322, 326 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). This principle is particularly salutary where, as *202 here, the legislative history reveals that Congress incorporated words having a special meaning within the field regulated by the statute so as to overcome objections by industry representatives that statutory definitions were vague and incomplete.
While a layman might well assume that time of day worked reflects one aspect of a job's ""working conditions,"" the term has a different and much more specific meaning in the language of industrial relations. As Corning's own representative testified at the hearings, the element of working conditions encompasses two subfactors: ""surroundings"" and ""hazards.""[20] ""Surroundings"" measures the elements, such as toxic chemicals or fumes, regularly encountered by a worker, their intensity, and their frequency. ""Hazards"" takes into account the physical hazards regularly encountered, their frequency, and the severity of injury they can cause. This definition of ""working conditions"" is not only manifested in Corning's own job evaluation plans but is also well accepted across a wide range of American industry.[21]
Nowhere in any of these definitions is time of day worked mentioned as a relevant criterion. The fact of the matter is that the concept of ""working conditions,"" as used in the specialized language of job evaluation systems, simply does not encompass shift differentials. Indeed, while Corning now argues that night inspection work is not equal to day inspection work, all of its own job evaluation plans, including the one now in effect, have consistently treated them as equal in all respects, *203 including working conditions.[22] And Corning's Manager of Job Evaluation testified in No. 73-29 that time of day worked was not considered to be a ""working condition.""[23] Significantly, it is not the Secretary in this case who is trying to look behind Corning's bona fide job evaluation system to require equal pay for jobs which Corning has historically viewed as unequal work. Rather, it is Corning which asks us to differentiate between jobs which the company itself has always equated. We agree with the Second Circuit that the inspection work at issue in this case, whether performed during the day or night, is ""equal work"" as that term is defined in the Act.[24]
*204 This does not mean, of course, that there is no room in the Equal Pay Act for nondiscriminatory shift differentials. Work on a steady night shift no doubt has psychological and physiological impacts making it less attractive than work on a day shift. The Act contemplates that a male night worker may receive a higher wage than a female day worker, just as it contemplates that a male employee with 20 years' seniority can receive a higher wage than a woman with two years' seniority. Factors such as these play a role under the Act's four exceptionsthe seniority differential under the specific seniority exception, the shift differential under the catchall exception for differentials ""based on any other factor other than sex.""[25]
The question remains, however, whether Corning carried its burden of proving that the higher rate paid for night inspection work, until 1966 performed solely by men, was in fact intended to serve as compensation for night work, or rather constituted an added payment based upon sex. We agree that the record amply supports the District Court's conclusion that Corning had not sustained its burden of proof.[26] As its history revealed, *205 ""the higher night rate was in large part the product of the generally higher wage level of male workers and the need to compensate them for performing what were regarded as demeaning tasks."" 474 F.2d, at 233. The differential in base wages originated at a time when no other night employees received higher pay than corresponding day workers, and it was maintained long after the company instituted a separate plant-wide shift differential which was thought to compensate adequately for the additional burdens of night work. The differential arose simply because men would not work at the low rates paid women inspectors, and it reflected a job market in which Corning could pay women less than men for the same work. That the company took advantage of such a situation may be understandable as a matter of economics, but its differential nevertheless became illegal once Congress enacted into law the principle of equal pay for equal work.

III
We now must consider whether Corning continued to remain in violation of the Act after 1966 when, without changing the base wage rates for day and night inspectors, it began to permit women to bid for jobs on the night shift as vacancies occurred. It is evident that this was more than a token gesture to end discrimination, as turnover in the night shift inspection jobs was rapid. The record in No. 73-29 shows, for example, that during the two-year period after June 1, 1966, the date women were first permitted to bid for night inspection jobs, women took 152 of the 278 openings, and women with very little seniority were able to obtain positions on the night shift. *206 Relying on these facts, the company argues that it ceased discriminating against women in 1966, and was no longer in violation of the Equal Pay Act.
But the issue before us is not whether the company, in some abstract sense, can be said to have treated men the same as women after 1966. Rather, the question is whether the company remedied the specific violation of the Act which the Secretary proved. We agree with the Second Circuit, as well as with all other circuits that have had occasion to consider this issue, that the company could not cure its violation except by equalizing the base wages of female day inspectors with the higher rates paid the night inspectors. This result is implicit in the Act's language, its statement of purpose, and its legislative history.
As the Second Circuit noted, Congress enacted the Equal Pay Act ""[r]ecognizing the weaker bargaining position of many women and believing that discrimination in wage rates represented unfair employer exploitation of this source of cheap labor."" 474 F.2d, at 234. In response to evidence of the many families dependent on the income of working women, Congress included in the Act's statement of purpose a finding that ""the existence. . . of wage differentials based on sex . . . depresses wages and living standards for employees necessary for their health and efficiency."" Pub. L. 88-38, § 2 (a) (1), 77 Stat. 56 (1963). And Congress declared it to be the policy of the Act to correct this condition. § 2 (b).
To achieve this end, Congress required that employers pay equal pay for equal work and then specified:
""Provided, That an employer who is paying a wage rate differential in violation of this subsection shall not, in order to comply with the provisions of this subsection, reduce the wage rate of any employee."" 29 U.S. C. § 206 (d) (1).
*207 The purpose of this proviso was to ensure that to remedy violations of the Act, ""[t]he lower wage rate must be increased to the level of the higher."" H. R. Rep. No. 309, supra, at 3. Comments of individual legislators are all consistent with this view. Representative Dwyer remarked, for example, ""The objective of equal pay legislation. . . is not to drag down men workers to the wage levels of women, but to raise women to the levels enjoyed by men in cases where discrimination is still practiced.""[27] Representative Griffin also thought it clear that ""[t]he only way a violation could be remedied under the bill . . . is for the lower wages to be raised to the higher.""[28]
By proving that after the effective date of the Equal Pay Act, Corning paid female day inspectors less than male night inspectors for equal work, the Secretary implicitly demonstrated that the wages of female day shift inspectors were unlawfully depressed and that the fair wage for inspection work was the base wage paid to male inspectors on the night shift. The whole purpose of the Act was to require that these depressed wages be raised, in part as a matter of simple justice to the employees themselves, but also as a matter of market economics, since Congress recognized as well that discrimination in wages on the basis of sex ""constitutes an unfair method of competition."" Pub. L. 88-38, supra, § 2 (a) (5).
We agree with Judge Friendly that
""In light of this apparent congressional understanding, we cannot hold that Corning, by allowing someor even manywomen to move into the higher paid night jobs, achieved full compliance with the Act. Corning's action still left the inspectors on the day shiftvirtually all womenearning a lower *208 base wage than the night shift inspectors because of a differential initially based on sex and still not justified by any other consideration; in effect, Corning was still taking advantage of the availability of female labor to fill its day shift at a differentially low wage rate not justified by any factor other than sex."" 474 F.2d, at 235.
The Equal Pay Act is broadly remedial, and it should be construed and applied so as to fulfill the underlying purposes which Congress sought to achieve. If, as the Secretary proved, the work performed by women on the day shift was equal to that performed by men on the night shift, the company became obligated to pay the women the same base wage as their male counterparts on the effective date of the Act. To permit the company to escape that obligation by agreeing to allow some women to work on the night shift at a higher rate of pay as vacancies occurred would frustrate, not serve, Congress' ends. See Shultz v. American Can Co.-Dixie Products, 424 F.2d 356, 359 (CA8 1970); Hodgson v. Miller Brewing Co., 457 F.2d 221, 227 (CA7 1972); Hodgson v. Square D Co., 459 F.2d 805, 808-809 (CA6 1972).
The company's final contentionthat it cured its violation of the Act when a new collective-bargaining agreement went into effect on January 20, 1969need not detain us long. While the new agreement provided for equal base wages for night or day inspectors hired after that date, it continued to provide unequal base wages for employees hired before that date, a discrimination likely to continue for some time into the future because of a large number of laid-off employees who had to be offered re-employment before new inspectors could be hired. After considering the rather complex method in which the new wage rates for employees hired prior to January 1969 were calculated and the company's stated purpose *209 behind the provisions of the new agreement, the District Court in No. 73-29 concluded that the lower base wage for day inspectors was a direct product of the company's failure to equalize the base wages for male and female inspectors as of the effective date of the Act. We agree it is clear from the record that had the company equalized the base-wage rates of male and female inspectors on the effective date of the Act, as the law required, the day inspectors in 1969 would have been entitled to the same higher ""red circle"" rate the company provided for night inspectors.[29] We therefore conclude that on the facts of this case, the company's continued discrimination in base wages between night and day workers, though phrased in terms of a neutral factor other than sex, nevertheless operated to perpetuate the effects of the company's prior illegal practice of paying women less *210 than men for equal work. Cf. Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 430 (1971).
The judgment in No. 73-29 is affirmed. The judgment in No. 73-695 is reversed and the case remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and MR.

"
34734,Justice Douglas,majority,False,Kahn v. Shevin,,1974,1.0,"Since at least 1885, Florida has provided for some form of property tax exemption for widows.[1] The current law granting all widows an annual $500 exemption, Fla. Stat. § 196.202 (Supp. 1974-1975), has been essentially unchanged since 1941.[2] Appellant Kahn is a widower who lives in Florida and applied for the exemption to the Dade County Tax Assessor's Office. It was denied because the statute offers no analogous benefit for widowers. Kahn then sought a declaratory judgment in the Circuit Court for Dade County, Florida, and that court held the statute violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the classification ""widow"" was based upon gender. The Florida Supreme Court reversed, finding the classification valid because it has a "" `fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation,' ""[3] that object being the reduction of ""the disparity between the economic capabilities of a man and a woman."" Kahn appealed here, 28 U.S. C. § 1257 (2), and we noted probable jurisdiction, 414 U.S. 973. We affirm.
*353 There can be no dispute that the financial difficulties confronting the lone woman in Florida or in any other State exceed those facing the man. Whether from overt discrimination or from the socialization process of a male-dominated culture, the job market is inhospitable to the woman seeking any but the lowest paid jobs.[4] There are, of course, efforts under way to remedy this situation. On the federal level, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits covered employers and labor unions from discrimination on the basis of sex, 78 Stat. 253, 42 U.S. C. §§ 2000e-2 (a), (c), as does the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 77 Stat. 56, 29 U.S. C. § 206 (d). But firmly entrenched practices are resistant to such pressures, and, indeed, data compiled by the Women's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor show that in 1972 a woman working full time had a median income which was only 57.9% of the median for malesa figure actually six points lower than had been achieved in 1955.[5] Other data point in the same direction.[6]*354 The disparity is likely to be exacerbated for the widow. While the widower can usually continue in the occupation which preceded his spouse's death, in many cases the widow will find herself suddenly forced into a job market with which she is unfamiliar, and in which, because of her former economic dependency, she will have fewer skills to offer.[7]
*355 There can be no doubt, therefore, that Florida's differing treatment of widows and widowers "" `rest[s] upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation.' "" Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 76, quoting Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U.S. 412, 415.
This is not a case like Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, where the Government denied its female employees both substantive and procedural benefits granted males ""solely . . . for administrative convenience."" Id., at 690 (emphasis in original).[8] We deal here with a state tax law reasonably designed to further the state policy of cushioning the financial impact of spousal loss upon the sex for which that loss imposes a disproportionately heavy burden. We have long held that ""[w]here taxation is concerned and no specific federal right, apart from equal protection, is imperiled, the States have large leeway in making classifications and drawing lines which in their judgment produce reasonable systems of taxation."" Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U.S. 356, 359. A state tax law is not arbitrary although it ""discriminate[s] in favor of a certain class . . . if the discrimination is founded upon a reasonable distinction, or difference in state policy,"" not in conflict with the Federal Constitution. Allied Stores v. Bowers, 358 U.S. 522, 528. This principle has weathered nearly a century of Supreme Court adjudication,[9]*356 and it applies here as well. The statute before us is well within those limits.[10]
Affirmed.
*357 MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR."
34736,Justice White,second_dissenting,False,Kahn v. Shevin,,1974,1.0,"The Florida tax exemption at issue here is available to all widows but not to widowers. The presumption is that all widows are financially more needy and less trained *361 or less ready for the job market than men. It may be that most widows have been occupied as housewife, mother, and homemaker and are not immediately prepared for employment. But there are many rich widows who need no largess from the State; many others are highly trained and have held lucrative positions long before the death of their husbands. At the same time, there are many widowers who are needy and who are in more desperate financial straits and have less access to the job market than many widows. Yet none of them qualifies for the exemption.
I find the discrimination invidious and violative of the Equal Protection Clause. There is merit in giving poor widows a tax break, but gender-based classifications are suspect and require more justification than the State has offered.
I perceive no purpose served by the exemption other than to alleviate current economic necessity, but the State extends the exemption to widows who do not need the help and denies it to widowers who do. It may be administratively inconvenient to make individual determinations of entitlement and to extend the exemption to needy men as well as needy women, but administrative efficiency is not an adequate justification for discriminations based purely on sex. Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973); Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971).
It may be suggested that the State is entitled to prefer widows over widowers because their assumed need is rooted in past and present economic discrimination against women. But this is not a credible explanation of Florida's tax exemption; for if the State's purpose was to compensate for past discrimination against females, surely it would not have limited the exemption to women who are widows. Moreover, even if past discrimination is considered to be the criterion for current tax exemption, *362 the State nevertheless ignores all those widowers who have felt the effects of economic discrimination, whether as a member of a racial group or as one of the many who cannot escape the cycle of poverty. It seems to me that the State in this case is merely conferring an economic benefit in the form of a tax exemption and has not adequately explained why women should be treated differently from men.
I dissent.

15802,Justice White,majority,False,Taylor v. Louisiana,,1975,2.0,"When this case was tried, Art. VII, § 41,[1] of the Louisiana Constitution, and Art. 402 of the Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure[2] provided that a woman should not be selected for jury service unless she had previously filed a written declaration of her desire to be subject to jury service. The constitutionality of these provisions is the issue in this case.


*524 I
Appellant, Billy J. Taylor, was indicted by the grand jury of St. Tammany Parish, in the Twenty-second Judicial District of Louisiana, for aggravated kidnaping. On April 12, 1972, appellant moved the trial court to quash the petit jury venire drawn for the special criminal term beginning with his trial the following day. Appellant alleged that women were systematically excluded from the venire and that he would therefore be deprived of what he claimed to be his federal constitutional right to ""a fair trial by jury of a representative segment of the community . . . .""
The Twenty-second Judicial District comprises the parishes of St. Tammany and Washington. The appellee has stipulated that 53% of the persons eligible for jury service in these parishes were female, and that no more than 10% of the persons on the jury wheel in St. Tammany Parish were women.[3] During the period from December 8, 1971, to November 3, 1972, 12 females were among the 1,800 persons drawn to fill petit jury venires in St. Tammany Parish. It was also stipulated that the discrepancy between females eligible for jury service and those actually included in the venire was the result of the operation of La. Const., Art. VII, § 41, and La. Code Crim. Proc., Art. 402.[4] In the present case, a venire totaling 175 persons was drawn for jury service beginning April 13, 1972. There were no females on the venire.
Appellant's motion to quash the venire was denied that same day. After being tried, convicted, and sentenced to death, appellant sought review in the Supreme Court of Louisiana, where he renewed his claim that the *525 petit jury venire should have been quashed. The Supreme Court of Louisiana, recognizing that this claim drew into question the constitutionality of the provisions of the Louisiana Constitution and Code of Criminal Procedure dealing with the service of women on juries, squarely held, one justice dissenting, that these provisions were valid and not unconstitutional under federal law. 282 So. 2d 491, 497 (1973).[5]
Appellant appealed from that decision to this Court. We noted probable jurisdiction, 415 U.S. 911 (1974), to consider whether the Louisiana jury-selection system deprived appellant of his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to an impartial jury trial. We hold that it did and that these Amendments were violated in this case by the operation of La. Const., Art. VII, § 41, and La. Code Crim. Proc., Art. 402. In consequence, appellant's conviction must be reversed.

II
The Louisiana jury-selection system does not disqualify women from jury service, but in operation its conceded systematic impact is that only a very few women, grossly disproportionate to the number of eligible women in the community, are called for jury service. In this case, no women were on the venire from which the petit jury was drawn. The issue we have, therefore, is whether a jury-selection system which operates to exclude from jury service an identifiable class of citizens constituting 53% *526 of eligible jurors in the community comports with the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.
The State first insists that Taylor, a male, has no standing to object to the exclusion of women from his jury. But Taylor's claim is that he was constitutionally entitled to a jury drawn from a venire constituting a fair cross section of the community and that the jury that tried him was not such a jury by reason of the exclusion of women. Taylor was not a member of the excluded class; but there is no rule that claims such as Taylor presents may be made only by those defendants who are members of the group excluded from jury service. In Peters v. Kiff, 407 U.S. 493 (1972), the defendant, a white man, challenged his conviction on the ground that Negroes had been systematically excluded from jury service. Six Members of the Court agreed that petitioner was entitled to present the issue and concluded that he had been deprived of his federal rights. Taylor, in the case before us, was similarly entitled to tender and have adjudicated the claim that the exclusion of women from jury service deprived him of the kind of factfinder to which he was constitutionally entitled.

III
The background against which this case must be decided includes our holding in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 (1968), that the Sixth Amendment's provision for jury trial is made binding on the States by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment. Our inquiry is whether the presence of a fair cross section of the community on venires, panels, or lists from which petit juries are drawn is essential to the fulfillment of the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of an impartial jury trial in criminal prosecutions.
The Court's prior cases are instructive. Both in the *527 course of exercising its supervisory powers over trials in federal courts and in the constitutional context, the Court has unambiguously declared that the American concept of the jury trial contemplates a jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community. A unanimous Court stated in Smith v. Texas, 311 U.S. 128, 130 (1940), that ""[i]t is part of the established tradition in the use of juries as instruments of public justice that the jury be a body truly representative of the community."" To exclude racial groups from jury service was said to be ""at war with our basic concepts of a democratic society and a representative government."" A state jury system that resulted in systematic exclusion of Negroes as jurors was therefore held to violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 85-86 (1942), in the context of a federal criminal case and the Sixth Amendment's jury trial requirement, stated that ""[o]ur notions of what a proper jury is have developed in harmony with our basic concepts of a democratic society and a representative government,"" and repeated the Court's understanding that the jury "" `be a body truly representative of the community'. . . and not the organ of any special group or class.""
A federal conviction by a jury from which women had been excluded, although eligible for service under state law, was reviewed in Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187 (1946). Noting the federal statutory ""design to make the jury `a cross-section of the community' "" and the fact that women had been excluded, the Court exercised its supervisory powers over the federal courts and reversed the conviction. In Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 474 (1953), the Court declared that ""[o]ur duty to protect the federal constitutional rights of all does not mean we must or should impose on states our conception of the proper source of jury lists, so long as the source *528 reasonably reflects a cross-section of the population suitable in character and intelligence for that civic duty.""
Some years later in Carter v. Jury Comm'n, 396 U.S. 320, 330 (1970), the Court observed that the exclusion of Negroes from jury service because of their race ""contravenes the very idea of a jury`a body truly representative of the community'. . . ."" (Quoting from Smith v. Texas, supra.) At about the same time it was contended that the use of six-man juries in noncapital criminal cases violated the Sixth Amendment for failure to provide juries drawn from a cross section of the community, Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78 (1970). In the course of rejecting that challenge, we said that the number of persons on the jury should ""be large enough to promote group deliberation, free from outside attempts at intimidation, and to provide a fair possibility for obtaining a representative cross-section of the community."" Id., at 100. In like vein, in Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404, 410-411 (1972) (plurality opinion), it was said that ""a jury will come to such a [commonsense] judgment as long as it consists of a group of laymen representative of a cross section of the community who have the duty and the opportunity to deliberate . . . on the question of a defendant's guilt."" Similarly, three Justices in Peters v. Kiff, 407 U. S., at 500, observed that the Sixth Amendment comprehended a fair possibility for obtaining a jury constituting a representative cross section of the community.
The unmistakable import of this Court's opinions, at least since 1940, Smith v. Texas, supra, and not repudiated by intervening decisions, is that the selection of a petit jury from a representative cross section of the community is an essential component of the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. Recent federal legislation governing jury selection within the federal court system has a similar thrust. Shortly prior to this Court's decision *529 in Duncan v. Louisiana, supra, the Federal Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968[6] was enacted. In that Act, Congress stated ""the policy of the United States that all litigants in Federal courts entitled to trial by jury shall have the right to grand and petit juries selected at random from a fair cross section of the community in the district or division wherein the court convenes."" 28 U.S. C. § 1861. In that Act, Congress also established the machinery by which the stated policy was to be implemented. 28 U.S. C. §§ 1862-1866. In passing this legislation, the Committee Reports of both the House[7] and the Senate[8] recognized that the jury plays a political function in the administration of the law and *530 that the requirement of a jury's being chosen from a fair cross section of the community is fundamental to the American system of justice. Debate on the floors of the House and Senate on the Act invoked the Sixth Amendment,[9] the Constitution generally,[10] and prior decisions of this Court[11] in support of the Act.
We accept the fair-cross-section requirement as fundamental to the jury trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment and are convinced that the requirement has solid foundation. The purpose of a jury is to guard against the exercise of arbitrary powerto make available the commonsense judgment of the community as a hedge against the overzealous or mistaken prosecutor and in preference to the professional or perhaps over-conditioned or biased response of a judge. Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S., at 155-156. This prophylactic vehicle is not provided if the jury pool is made up of only special segments of the populace or if large, distinctive groups are excluded from the pool. Community participation in the administration of the criminal law, moreover, is not only consistent with our democratic heritage but is also critical to public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system. Restricting jury service to only special groups or excluding identifiable segments playing major roles in the community cannot be squared with the constitutional concept of jury trial. ""Trial by jury presupposes a jury drawn from a pool broadly representative of the community as well as impartial in a specific case. . . . [T]he broad representative character of the jury should be maintained, partly as assurance of a diffused impartiality and partly *531 because sharing in the administration of justice is a phase of civic responsibility."" Thiel v. Southern Pacific Co., 328 U.S. 217, 227 (1946) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).

IV
We are also persuaded that the fair-cross-section requirement is violated by the systematic exclusion of women, who in the judicial district involved here amounted to 53% of the citizens eligible for jury service. This conclusion necessarily entails the judgment that women are sufficiently numerous and distinct from men and that if they are systematically eliminated from jury panels, the Sixth Amendment's fair-cross-section requirement cannot be satisfied. This very matter was debated in Ballard v. United States, supra. Positing the fair-cross-section rulethere said to be a statutory onethe Court concluded that the systematic exclusion of women was unacceptable. The dissenting view that an all-male panel drawn from various groups in the community would be as truly representative as if women were included, was firmly rejected:
""The thought is that the factors which tend to influence the action of women are the same as those which influence the action of menpersonality, background, economic statusand not sex. Yet it is not enough to say that women when sitting as jurors neither act nor tend to act as a class. Men likewise do not act as a class. But, if the shoe were on the other foot, who would claim that a jury was truly representative of the community if all men were intentionally and systematically excluded from the panel? The truth is that the two sexes are not fungible; a community made up exclusively of one is different from a community composed of both; the subtle interplay of influence one on the other is *532 among the imponderables. To insulate the court-room from either may not in a given case make an iota of difference. Yet a flavor, a distinct quality is lost if either sex is excluded. The exclusion of one may indeed make the jury less representative of the community than would be true if an economic or racial group were excluded."" 329 U.S., at 193-194.[12]
*533 In this respect, we agree with the Court in Ballard: If the fair-cross-section rule is to govern the selection of juries, as we have concluded it must, women cannot be systematically excluded from jury panels from which petit juries are drawn. This conclusion is consistent with the current judgment of the country, now evidenced by legislative or constitutional provisions in every State and at the federal level qualifying women for jury service.[13]

V
There remains the argument that women as a class serve a distinctive role in society and that jury service would so substantially interfere with that function that the State has ample justification for excluding women from service unless they volunteer, even though the result is that almost all jurors are men. It is true that Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U.S. 57 (1961), held that such a system[14] did not deny due process of law or equal protection *534 of the laws because there was a sufficiently rational basis for such an exemption.[15] But Hoyt did not involve a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community and the prospect of depriving him of that right if women as a class are systematically excluded. The right to a proper jury cannot be overcome on merely rational grounds.[16] There must be weightier reasons if a distinctive class representing 53% of the eligible jurors is for all practical purposes to be excluded from jury service. No such basis has been tendered here.
The States are free to grant exemptions from jury service to individuals in case of special hardship or incapacity and to those engaged in particular occupations the uninterrupted performance of which is critical to the community's welfare. Rawlins v. Georgia, 201 U.S. 638 (1906). It would not appear that such exemptions would pose substantial threats that the remaining pool of jurors would not be representative of the community. A system excluding all women, however, is a wholly different matter. It is untenable to suggest these days that it would be a special hardship for each and every woman to perform jury service or that society cannot *535 spare any women from their present duties.[17] This may be the case with many, and it may be burdensome to sort out those who should be exempted from those who should serve. But that task is performed in the case of men, and the administrative convenience in dealing with women as a class is insufficient justification for diluting the quality of community judgment represented by the jury in criminal trials.

VI
Although this judgment may appear a foregone conclusion from the pattern of some of the Court's cases over the past 30 years, as well as from legislative developments at both federal and state levels, it is nevertheless true that until today no case had squarely held that the exclusion of women from jury venires deprives a criminal *536 defendant of his Sixth Amendment right to trial by an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community. It is apparent that the first Congress did not perceive the Sixth Amendment as requiring women on criminal jury panels; for the direction of the First Judiciary Act of 1789 was that federal jurors were to have the qualifications required by the States in which the federal court was sitting[18] and at the time women were disqualified under state law in every State. Necessarily, then, federal juries in criminal cases were all male, and it was not until the Civil Rights Act of 1957, 71 Stat. 638, 28 U.S. C. § 1861 (1964 ed.), that Congress itself provided that all citizens, with limited exceptions, were competent to sit on federal juries. Until that time, federal courts were required by statute to exclude women from jury duty in those States where women were disqualified. Utah was the first State to qualify women for juries; it did so in 1898, n. 13, supra. Moreover, Hoyt v. Florida was decided and has stood for the proposition that, even if women as a group could not be constitutionally disqualified from jury service, there was ample reason to treat all women differently from men for the purpose of jury service and to exclude them unless they volunteered.[19]
*537 Accepting as we do, however, the view that the Sixth Amendment affords the defendant in a criminal trial the opportunity to have the jury drawn from venires representative of the community, we think it is no longer tenable to hold that women as a class may be excluded or given automatic exemptions based solely on sex if the consequence is that criminal jury venires are almost totally male. To this extent we cannot follow the contrary implications of the prior cases, including Hoyt v. Florida. If it was ever the case that women were unqualified to sit on juries or were so situated that none of them should be required to perform jury service, that time has long since passed. If at one time it could be held that Sixth Amendment juries must be drawn from a fair cross section of the community but that this requirement permitted the almost total exclusion of women, this is not the case today. Communities differ at different times and places. What is a fair cross section at one time or place is not necessarily a fair cross section at another time or a different place. Nothing persuasive has been presented to us in this case suggesting that all-male venires in the parishes involved here are fairly representative of the local population otherwise eligible for jury service.

VII
Our holding does not augur or authorize the fashioning of detailed jury-selection codes by federal courts. The *538 fair-cross-section principle must have much leeway in application. The States remain free to prescribe relevant qualifications for their jurors and to provide reasonable exemptions so long as it may be fairly said that the jury lists or panels are representative of the community. Carter v. Jury Comm'n, supra, as did Brown v. Allen, supra; Rawlins v. Georgia, supra, and other cases, recognized broad discretion in the States in this respect. We do not depart from the principles enunciated in Carter. But, as we have said, Louisiana's special exemption for women operates to exclude them from petit juries, which in our view is contrary to the command of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.
It should also be emphasized that in holding that petit juries must be drawn from a source fairly representative of the community we impose no requirement that petit juries actually chosen must mirror the community and reflect the various distinctive groups in the population. Defendants are not entitled to a jury of any particular composition, Fay v. New York, 332 U.S. 261, 284 (1947); Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U. S., at 413 (plurality opinion); but the jury wheels, pools of names, panels, or venires from which juries are drawn must not systematically exclude distinctive groups in the community and thereby fail to be reasonably representative thereof.
The judgment of the Louisiana Supreme Court is reversed and the case remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
So ordered.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER concurs in the result.
MR."
19839,Justice Rehnquist,dissenting,False,Stanton v. Stanton,,1975,2.0,"The Court views this case as requiring a determination of whether the Utah statute specifying that males must reach a higher age than females before attaining their majority denies females the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court regards the constitutionality of Utah Code Ann. § 15-2-1 (1953) as properly at issue because of the manner in which the Supreme Court of Utah approached and decided the case. But this Court is subject to constraints with respect to constitutional adjudication which may well not bind the Supreme Court of Utah. This Court is bound by the rule, ""to which it has rigidly adhered, . . . never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied,"" Liverpool, N. Y. & Phila. S. S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113 U.S. 33. 39 (1885). and we try to avoid deciding constitutional questions which ""come to us in highly abstract form,"" Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, 331 U.S. 549, 575 (1947). Fidelity to these longstanding *19 rules dictates that we have some regard for the factual background of this case, as fully outlined in the Court's opinion, before deciding the constitutional question that has been tendered to us.
The Utah statute which the Court invalidates ""in the context of child support,"" ante, at 17, does not by its terms define the age at which the obligation of a divorced parent to support a child ceases. The parties concede that the Stantons could have provided in their property settlement agreement that appellee's obligation to support Sherri and Rick would terminate when both turned 18, when both turned 21, or when one turned 18 and the other turned 21. Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, 14, 23. This case arises only because appellant and appellee made no provision in their property settlement agreement fixing the age at which appellee's obligation to support his son or daughter would terminate. The Supreme Court of Utah, faced with the necessity of filling in this blank, referred to the State's general age-of-majority statute in supplying the terms which the parties had neglected to specify themselves.
Had the Supreme Court of Utah relied upon the statute only insofar as it cast light on the intention of the parties regarding the child support obligations contained in the divorce decree, there would be no basis for reaching the constitutionality of the statute. In supplying the missing term in an agreement executed between two private parties, a court ordinarily looks to the customs, mores, and practice of the parties in an attempt to ascertain what was intended. If, upon consideration of these factors, including the age-of-majority statute, the Utah Supreme Court had concluded that the Stantons intended to bestow more of their limited resources upon a son than a daughter, perhaps for the reasons stated in the opinion of that court, that strikes *20 me as an entirely permissible basis upon which to construe the property settlement agreement.
On the other hand, the Supreme Court of Utah may have concluded that, the parties having failed to specify this term of the agreement, the question became one of Utah statutory law rather than one of determining the intent of the parties. If that were its determination, the constitutionality of Utah Code Ann. § 15-2-1 (1953), would indeed be implicated in this case.
I do not think it possible to say with confidence which of these two approaches was taken by the Supreme Court of Utah in this case. In addition to this difficulty, there is another element of attenuation between the claim asserted on behalf of Sherri to be treated like her brother for purposes of child support, and the actual case before us. Utah has a comprehensive scheme dealing with child support in its Uniform Civil Liability for Support Act, Utah Code Ann. § 78-45-1 et seq. (Supp. 1973). Under that Act, ""child"" is defined as ""a son or daughter under the age of twenty-one years,"" § 78-45-2 (4). Thus, for purposes of any direct claim by Sherri against appellee, Utah law treats her precisely as it does her brother. The claim asserted in this case is not by Sherri, but by her mother, and the source of any claim which the mother has against appellee necessarily arises out of the voluntary property settlement agreement which they executed at the time of their divorce.
These factors lead me to conclude that the issue which the Court says is presented by this case, and which it decides, cannot properly be decided on these facts if we are to adhere to our established policy of avoiding unnecessary constitutional adjudication. I would dismiss the appeal for that reason. Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, supra; Socialist Labor Party v. Gilligan, 406 U.S. 583 (1972).
"
19838,Justice Blackmun,majority,False,Stanton v. Stanton,,1975,2.0,"This case presents the issue whether a state statute specifying for males a greater age of majority than it specifies for females denies, in the context of a parent's obligation for support payments for his children, the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

I
Appellant Thelma B. Stanton and appellee James Lawrence Stanton, Jr., were married at Elko, Nev., in February 1951. At the suit of the appellant, they were divorced in Utah on November 29, 1960. They have a daughter, Sherri Lyn, born in February 1953, and a son, Rick Arlund, born in January 1955. Sherri became 18 on February 12, 1971, and Rick on January 29, 1973.
During the divorce proceedings in the District Court of Salt Lake County, the parties entered into a stipulation as to property, child support, and alimony. The court awarded custody of the children to their mother and incorporated provisions of the stipulation into its findings and conclusions and into its decree of divorce. Specifically, as to alimony and child support, the decree provided:
""Defendant is ordered to pay to plaintiff the sum of $300.00 per month as child support and alimony, *9 $100.00 per month for each child as child support and $100.00 per month as alimony, to be paid on or before the 1st day of each month through the office of the Salt Lake County Clerk."" App. 6.
The appellant thereafter remarried; the court, pursuant to another stipulation, then modified the decree to relieve the appellee from payment of further alimony. The appellee also later remarried.
When Sherri attained 18 the appellee discontinued payments for her support. In May 1973 the appellant moved the divorce court for entry of judgment in her favor and against the appellee for, among other things, support for the children for the periods after each respectively attained the age of 18 years. The court concluded that on February 12, 1971, Sherri ""became 18 years of age, and under the provisions of [§] 15-2-1 Utah Code Annotated 1953, thereby attained her majority. Defendant is not obligated to plaintiff for maintenance and support of Sherri Lyn Stanton since that date."" App. 23. An order denying the appellant's motion was entered accordingly. Id., at 24-25.
The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court of Utah. She contended, among other things, that Utah Code Ann. § 15-2-1 (1953)[*] to the effect that the period of minority for males extends to age 21 and for females to age 18, is invidiously discriminatory and serves to deny due process and equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and of the corresponding *10 provisions of the Utah Constitution, namely, Art. I, §§ 7 and 24, and Art. IV, § 1. On this issue, the Utah court affirmed. 30 Utah 2d 315, 517 P.2d 1010 (1974). The court acknowledged: ""There is no doubt that the questioned statute treats men and women differently,"" but said that people may be treated differently ""so long as there is a reasonable basis for the classification, which is related to the purposes of the act, and it applies equally and uniformly to all persons within the class."" Id., at 318, 517 P.2d, at 1012. The court referred to what it called some ""old notions,"" namely, ""that generally it is the man's primary responsibility to provide a home and its essentials,"" ibid.; that ""it is a salutary thing for him to get a good education and/or training before he undertakes those responsibilities,"" id., at 319, 517 P.2d, at 1012; that ""girls tend generally to mature physically, emotionally and mentally before boys""; and that ""they generally tend to marry earlier,"" ibid. It concluded:
""[I]t is our judgment that there is no basis upon which we would be justified in concluding that the statute is so beyond a reasonable doubt in conflict with constitutional provisions that it should be stricken down as invalid."" Id., at 319, 517 P.2d, at 1013.
If such a change were desirable, the court said, ""that is a matter which should commend itself to the attention of the legislature."" Id., at 320, 517 P.2d, at 1013. The appellant, thus, was held not entitled to support for Sherri for the period after she attained 18, but was entitled to support for Rick ""during his minority"" unless otherwise ordered by the trial court. Ibid., 517 P. 2d, at 1014.
We noted probable jurisdiction. 419 U.S. 893 (1974).


*11 II
The appellee initially suggests that the support issue is moot and that, in any event, the appellant lacks standing. These arguments are related and we reject both of them.
A. The mootness suggestion is based on the propositions that both the appellant and Sherri are now over 21 and that neither possesses rights that ""can be affected by the outcome of this proceeding."" Brief for Appellee 9. At the time the case was before us on the jurisdictional statement, the appellee suggested that the case involved a nonjusticiable political question. Appellee's Motion to Dismiss 6-7. Each approach, of course, overlooks the fact that what is at issue is support for the daughter during her years between 18 and 21. If appellee, under the divorce decree, is obligated for Sherri's support during that period, it is an obligation that has not been fulfilled, and there is an amount past due and owing from the appellee. The obligation issue, then, plainly presents a continuing live case or controversy. It is neither moot nor nonjusticiable.
B. The suggestion as to standing is that the appellant is not of the age group affected by the Utah statute and that she therefore lacks a personal stake in the resolution of the issue. It is said that when the appellant signed the stipulation as to support payments, she took the Utah law as it was and thus waived, or is estopped from asserting, any right to support payments after the daughter attained age 18.
We are satisfied that it makes no difference whether the appellant's interest in any obligation of the appellee, under the divorce decree, for Sherri's support between ages 18 and 21, is regarded as an interest personal to appellant or as that of a fiduciary. The Utah court has described support money as ""compensation to a spouse *12 for the support of minor children."" Anderson v. Anderson, 110 Utah 300, 306, 172 P.2d 132, 135 (1946). And the right to past due support money appears to be the supplying spouse's not the child's. Larsen v. Larsen, 5 Utah 2d 224, 228, 300 P.2d 596, 598 (1956). See also Baggs v. Anderson, 528 P.2d 141, 143 (Utah 1974). The appellant, therefore, clearly has a ""personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions."" Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962); Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 102 (1968). We see nothing in the stipulation itself that is directed to the question when majority is reached for purposes of support payments or that smacks of waiver. In addition, the Uniform Civil Liability for Support Act has been in effect in Utah since 1957. Laws of Utah, 1957, c. 110, now codified as Utah Code Ann. §§ 78-45-1 through 78-45-13 (Supp. 1973). Section 78-45-4 specifically provides: ""Every woman shall support her child."" This is in addition to the mandate contained in § 78-45-3: ""Every man shall support his wife and his child."" ""Child"" is defined to mean ""a son or daughter under the age of twenty-one years."" § 78-45-2(4). And § 78-45-12 states: ""The rights herein created are in addition to and not in substitution [of] any other rights.""
The appellant herself thus had a legal obligation under Utah law to support her daughter until Sherri became 21. That obligation, however, obviously was not in derogation of any right she might have against the appellee under the divorce decree. Her interest in the controversy, therefore, is distinct and significant and is one that assures ""concrete adverseness"" and proper standing on her part.


*13 III
We turn to the merits. The appellant argues that Utah's statutory prescription establishing different ages of majority for males and females denies equal protection; that it is a classification based solely on sex and affects a child's ""fundamental right"" to be fed, clothed, and sheltered by its parents; that no compelling state interest supports the classification; and that the statute can withstand no judicial scrutiny, ""close"" or otherwise, for it has no relationship to any ascertainable legislative objective. The appellee contends that the test is that of rationality and that the age classification has a rational basis and endures any attack based on equal protection.
We find it unnecessary in this case to decide whether a classification based on sex is inherently suspect. See Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636 (1975); Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U.S. 498 (1975); Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484 (1974); Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U.S. 351 (1974); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973); Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971).
Reed, we feel, is controlling here. That case presented an equal protection challenge to a provision of the Idaho probate code which gave preference to males over females when persons otherwise of the same entitlement applied for appointment as administrator of a decedent's estate. No regard was paid under the statute to the applicants' respective individual qualifications. In upholding the challenge, the Court reasoned that the Idaho statute accorded different treatment on the basis of sex and that it ""thus establishes a classification subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause."" Id., at 75. The Clause, it was said, denies to States ""the power to legislate that different treatment be accorded to persons placed by a statute into different classes on the basis of criteria wholly unrelated to the objective of that statute."" Id., *14 at 75-76. ""A classification `must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.' Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U.S. 412, 415 (1920)."" Id., at 76. It was not enough to save the statute that among its objectives were the elimination both of an area of possible family controversy and of a hearing on the comparative merits of petitioning relatives.
The test here, then, is whether the difference in sex between children warrants the distinction in the appellee's obligation to support that is drawn by the Utah statute. We conclude that it does not. It may be true, as the Utah court observed and as is argued here, that it is the man's primary responsibility to provide a home and that it is salutary for him to have education and training before he assumes that responsibility; that girls tend to mature earlier than boys; and that females tend to marry earlier than males. The last mentioned factor, however, under the Utah statute loses whatever weight it otherwise might have, for the statute states that ""all minors obtain their majority by marriage""; thus minority, and all that goes with it, is abruptly lost by marriage of a person of either sex at whatever tender age the marriage occurs.
Notwithstanding the ""old notions"" to which the Utah court referred, we perceive nothing rational in the distinction drawn by § 15-2-1 which, when related to the divorce decree, results in the appellee's liability for support for Sherri only to age 18 but for Rick to age 21. This imposes ""criteria wholly unrelated to the objective of that statute."" A child, male or female, is still a child. No longer is the female destined solely for the home and the rearing of the family, and only the male for the *15 marketplace and the world of ideas. See Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 535 n. 17 (1975). Women's activities and responsibilities are increasing and expanding. Coeducation is a fact, not a rarity. The presence of women in business, in the professions, in government and, indeed, in all walks of life where education is a desirable, if not always a necessary, antecedent is apparent and a proper subject of judicial notice. If a specified age of minority is required for the boy in order to assure him parental support while he attains his education and training, so, too, is it for the girl. To distinguish between the two on educational grounds is to be self-serving: if the female is not to be supported so long as the male, she hardly can be expected to attend school as long as he does, and bringing her education to an end earlier coincides with the role-typing society has long imposed. And if any weight remains in this day to the claim of earlier maturity of the female, with a concomitant inference of absence of need for support beyond 18, we fail to perceive its unquestioned truth or its significance, particularly when marriage, as the statute provides, terminates minority for a person of either sex.
Only Arkansas, as far as our investigation reveals, remains with Utah in fixing the age of majority for females at 18 and for males at 21. Ark. Stat. Ann. § 57-103 (1971). See Petty v. Petty, 252 Ark. 1032, 482 S.W.2d 119 (1972). Furthermore, Utah itself draws the 18-21 distinction only in § 15-2-1 defining minority, and in § 30-1-9 relating to marriage without the consent of parent or guardian. See also § 30-1-2 (4) making void a marriage where the male is under 16 or the female under 14. Elsewhere, in the State's present constitutional and statutory structure, the male and the female appear to be treated alike. The State's Constitution provides that the rights of Utah citizens to vote and hold office ""shall not *16 be denied or abridged on account of sex,"" and that ""[b]oth male and female citizens . . . shall enjoy equally all civil, political and religious rights and privileges,"" Art. IV, § 1, and, since long before the Nation's adoption of the Twenty-sixth Amendment in 1971, did provide that every citizen ""of the age of twenty-one years and upwards,"" who satisfies durational requirements, ""shall be entitled to vote."" Art. IV, § 2. Utah's statutes provide that any citizen over the age of 21 who meets specified nonsex qualifications is ""competent to act as a juror,"" Utah Code Ann. § 78-46-8, may be admitted to the practice of law, § 78-51-10, and may act as an incorporator, § 16-10-48, and, if under 21 and in need, may be entitled to public assistance, § 55-15a-17. The ages at which persons may serve in legislative, executive, and judicial offices are the same for males and females. Utah Const., Art. VI, § 5, Art. VII, § 3, and Art. VIII, § 2. Tobacco may not be sold, purchased, or possessed by persons of either sex under 19 years of age. §§ 76-10-104 and 76-10-105 (see Laws of Utah, 1974, §§ 39-40). No age differential is imposed with respect to the issuance of motor vehicle licenses. § 41-2-10. State adult education programs are open to every person 18 years of age or over. § 53-30-5. The Uniform Gifts to Minors Act is in effect in Utah and defines a minor, for its purposes, as any person ""who has not attained the age of twenty-one years."" § 75-15-2.11 (Supp. 1973). Juvenile court jurisdiction extends to persons of either sex under a designated age. §§ 55-10-64 and 55-10-77. Every person over the age of 18 and of sound mind may dispose of his property by will. § 74-1-1. And the Uniform Civil Liability for Support Act, noted above and in effect in Utah since 1957, imposes on each parent an obligation of support of both sons and daughters until age 21. §§ 78-45-2 (4), 78-45-3, and 78-45-4 (Supp. 1973).
*17 This is not to say that § 15-2-1 does not have important effect in application. A ""minor"" may disaffirm his contracts. § 15-2-2. An ""infant"" must appear in court by guardian or guardian ad litem. Utah Rule Civ. Proc. 17 (b). A parent has a right of action for injury to, or wrongful death of, ""a minor child."" § 78-11-6. A person ""[u]nder the age of majority"" is not competent or entitled to serve as an administrator of a decedent's estate, § 75-4-4, or as the executor of a decedent's will. § 75-3-15 (1). The statute of limitations is tolled while a person entitled to bring an action is ""[u]nder the age of majority."" § 78-12-36. Thus, the distinction drawn by § 15-2-1 affects other rights and duties. It has pervasive effect, both direct and collateral.
We therefore conclude that under any testcompelling state interest, or rational basis, or something in between § 15-2-1, in the context of child support, does not survive an equal protection attack. In that context, no valid distinction between male and female may be drawn.

IV
Our conclusion that in the context of child support the classification effectuated by § 15-2-1 denies the equal protection of the laws, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, does not finally resolve the controversy as between this appellant and this appellee. With the age differential held invalid, it is not for this Court to determine when the appellee's obligation for his children's support, pursuant to the divorce decree, terminates under Utah law. The appellant asserts that, with the classification eliminated, the common law applies and that at common law the age of majority for both males and females is 21. The appellee claims that any unconstitutional inequality between males and females is to be remedied by treating males as adults at age 18, rather than by withholding the privileges of adulthood from *18 women until they reach 21. This plainly is an issue of state law to be resolved by the Utah courts on remand; the issue was noted, incidentally, by the Supreme Court of Utah. 30 Utah 2d, at 319, 517 P.2d, at 1013. The appellant, although prevailing here on the federal constitutional issue, may or may not ultimately win her lawsuit. See Harrigfeld v. District Court, 95 Idaho 540, 511 P.2d 822 (1973); Commonwealth v. Butler, 458 Pa. 289, 328 A.2d 851 (1974); Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 542-543 (1942).
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Utah is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
MR."
5673,Justice Rehnquist,dissenting,False,Bigelow v. Virginia,,1975,2.0,"The Court's opinion does not confront head-on the question which this case poses, but makes contact with *830 it only in a series of verbal sideswipes. The result is the fashioning of a doctrine which appears designed to obtain reversal of this judgment, but at the same time to save harmless from the effects of that doctrine the many prior cases of this Court which are inconsistent with it.
I am in agreement with the Court, ante, at 817-818, that Virginia's statute cannot properly be invalidated on grounds of overbreadth,[1] given that the sole prosecution which has ever been brought under this now substantially altered statute is that now in issue. ""It is the law as applied that we review, not the abstract, academic questions which it might raise in some more doubtful case."" Saia v. New York, 334 U.S. 558, 571 (1948) (Jackson, J., dissenting).
Since the Court concludes, apparently from two lines of the advertisement, ante, at 812, that it conveyed information of value to those interested in the ""subject matter or the law of another State and its development"" and to those ""seeking reform in Virginia,"" ante, at 822, and since the ad relates to abortion, elevated to constitutional stature by the Court, it concludes that this advertisement is entitled to something more than the limited constitutional protection traditionally accorded commercial advertising. See ante, at 825 n. 10. Although recognizing that ""[a]dvertising, like all public expression, may be subject to reasonable regulation that serves a legitimate public interest,"" ante, at 826, the Court for reasons not entirely clear to me concludes that Virginia's interest is of ""little, if any, weight."" Ante, at 828.
*831 If the Court's decision does, indeed, turn upon its conclusion that the advertisement here in question was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the subject of the advertisement ought to make no difference. It will not do to say, as the Court does, that this advertisement conveyed information about the ""subject matter or the law of another State and its development"" to those ""seeking reform in Virginia,"" and that it related to abortion, as if these factors somehow put it on a different footing from other commercial advertising. This was a proposal to furnish services on a commercial basis, and since we have always refused to distinguish for First Amendment purposes on the basis of content, it is no different from an advertisement for a bucket shop operation or a Ponzi scheme which has its headquarters in New York. If Virginia may not regulate advertising of commercial abortion agencies because of the interest of those seeking to reform Virginia's abortion laws, it is difficult to see why it is not likewise precluded from regulating advertising for an out-of-state bucket shop on the ground that such information might be of interest to those interested in repealing Virginia's ""blue sky"" laws.
As a threshold matter the advertisement appears to me, as it did to the courts below, to be a classic commercial proposition directed toward the exchange of services rather than the exchange of ideas. It was apparently also so interpreted by the newspaper which published it which stated in apparent apology in its following issue that the "" `Weekly collective has since learned that this abortion agency . . . as well as a number of other commercial groups are charging women a fee for a service which is done free by Women's Liberation, Planned Parenthood, and others.' "" 213 Va. 191, 194, 191 S.E.2d 173, 175 (1972). Whatever slight factual content the advertisement may contain and *832 whatever expression of opinion may be laboriously drawn from it does not alter its predominantly commercial content. ""If that evasion were successful, every merchant who desires to broadcast . . . need only append a civic appeal, or a moral platitude, to achieve immunity from the law's command."" Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U.S. 52, 55 (1942). See, e. g., Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463, 474 n. 17 (1966). I am unable to perceive any relationship between the instant advertisement and that for example in issue in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 292 (1964). Nor am I able to distinguish this commercial proposition from that held to be purely commercial in Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Rel. Comm'n, 413 U.S. 376 (1973). As the Court recognizes, ante, at 819-821, a purely commercial proposal is entitled to little constitutional protection.
Assuming arguendo that this advertisement is something more than a normal commercial proposal, I am unable to see why Virginia does not have a legitimate public interest in its regulation. The Court apparently concedes, ante, at 825 n. 10, and our cases have long held, that the States have a strong interest in the prevention of commercial advertising in the health fieldboth in order to maintain high ethical standards in the medical profession and to protect the public from unscrupulous practices. See, e. g., Semler v. Dental Examiners, 294 U.S. 608, 612 (1935); Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 490-491 (1955); North Dakota Pharmacy Bd. v. Snyder's Stores, 414 U.S. 156 (1973). And the interest asserted by the Supreme Court of Virginia in the Virginia statute was the prevention of commercial exploitation of those women who elect to have an abortion:
""It is clearly within the police power of the state to enact reasonable measures to ensure that pregnant *833 women in Virginia who decide to have abortions come to their decisions without the commercial advertising pressure usually incidental to the sale of a box of soap powder. And the state is rightfully interested in seeing that Virginia women who do decide to have abortions obtain proper medical care and do not fall into the hands of those interested only in financial gain, and not in the welfare of the patient."" 213 Va., at 196, 191 S.E.2d, at 176.
The concern of the Virginia Supreme Court was not a purely hypothetical one. As the majority notes, ante, at 822-823, n. 8, although New York at the time of this advertisement allowed profitmaking abortion referral agencies, it soon thereafter passed legislation prohibiting commercial advertisement of the type here in issue. The court in S. P. S. Consultants, Inc. v. Lefkowitz, 333 F. Supp. 1373, 1378 (SDNY 1971), quoted the author of that legislation on the reasons for its passage:
"" `Because New York State has the most liberal abortion statute within the Continental United States, thousands of women from all over the country are coming into New York State . . . . [M]ost of these women came here through referral agencies who advertise nationally. These agencies, for a sizable fee, make all abortion arrangements for a patient. We also learned that certain hospitals give discounts to these lucrative, profit-making organizations. Thus, at the expense of desperate, frightened women these agencies are making a huge profit some, such a huge profit that our Committee members were actually shocked.""
See, e. g., State v. Mitchell, 66 Misc. 2d 514, 321 N. Y. S. 2d 756 (1971); State v. Abortion Information Agency, Inc., 69 Misc. 2d 825, 323 N. Y. S. 2d 597 (1971).
*834 Without denying the power of either New York or Virginia to prohibit advertising such as that in issue where both publication of the advertised activity and the activity itself occur in the same State, the Court instead focuses on the multistate nature of this transaction, concluding that a State ""may not, under the guise of exercising internal police powers, bar a citizen of another State from disseminating information about an activity that is legal in that State."" Ante, at 824-825. And the Court goes so far as to suggest that it is an open question whether a State may constitutionally prohibit an advertisement containing an invitation or offer to engage in activity which is criminal both in the State of publication and in the proposed sites of the crime. See ante, at 828 n. 14.
The source of this rigid territorial limitation on the power of the States in our federal system to safeguard the health and welfare of their citizens is not revealed. It is surely not to be found in cases from this Court.[2]*835 Beginning at least with our decision in Delamater v. South Dakota, 205 U.S. 93, 100 (1907), we have consistently recognized that irrespective of a State's power to regulate extraterritorial commercial transactions in which its citizens participate it retains an independent power to regulate the business of commercial solicitation and advertising within its borders. Thus, for example, in Head v. New Mexico Board, 374 U.S. 424 (1963), we upheld the power of New Mexico to prohibit commercial advertising by a New Mexico radio station of optometric services provided in Texas. Mr. JUSTICE BRENNAN, concurring in that opinion, noted that a contrary result might well produce ""a `no-man's land' . . . in which there would be at best selective policing of the various advertising abuses and excesses which are now very extensively regulated by state law."" Id., at 446. See, e. g., Packer Corp. v. Utah, 285 U.S. 105 (1932); Breard v. Alexandria, 341 U.S. 622 (1951).
Were the Court's statements taken literally, they would presage a standard of the lowest common denominator for commercial ethics and business conduct. Securities issuers could circumvent the established bluesky laws of States which had carefully drawn such laws for the protection of their citizens by establishing as a situs for transactions those States without such regulations, while spreading offers throughout the country. Loan sharks might well choose States with unregulated small loan industries, luring the unwary with immune *836 commercial advertisements. And imagination would place the only limit on the use of such a ""no-man's land"" together with artificially created territorial contacts to bilk the public and circumvent long-established state schemes of regulation.
Since the Court saves harmless from its present opinion our prior cases in this area, ante, at 825 n. 10, it may be fairly inferred that it does not intend the results which might otherwise come from a literal reading of its opinion. But solely on the facts before it, I think the Court today simply errs in assessing Virginia's interest in its statute because it does not focus on the impact of the practices in question on the State. Cf. Young v. Masci, 289 U.S. 253 (1933). Although the commercial referral agency, whose advertisement in Virginia was barred, was physically located outside the State, this physical contact says little about Virginia's concern for the touted practices. Virginia's interest in this statute lies in preventing commercial exploitation of the health needs of its citizens. So long as the statute bans commercial advertising by publications within the State, the extraterritorial location at which the services are actually provided does not diminish that interest.
Since the statute in question is a ""reasonable regulation that serves a legitimate public interest,"" ante, at 826, I would affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia.
"
15803,Justice Rehnquist,dissenting,False,Taylor v. Louisiana,,1975,2.0,"The Court's opinion reverses a conviction without a suggestion, much less a showing, that the appellant has been unfairly treated or prejudiced in any way by the *539 manner in which his jury was selected. In so doing, the Court invalidates a jury-selection system which it approved by a substantial majority only 13 years ago. I disagree with the Court and would affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana.
The majority opinion canvasses various of our jury trial cases, beginning with Smith v. Texas, 311 U.S. 128 (1940). Relying on carefully chosen quotations, it concludes that the ""unmistakable import"" of our cases is that the fair-cross-section requirement ""is an essential component of the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial."" I disagree. Fairly read, the only ""unmistakable import"" of those cases is that due process and equal protection prohibit jury-selection systems which are likely to result in biased or partial juries. Smith v. Texas, supra, concerned the equal protection claim of a Negro who was indicted by a grand jury from which Negroes had been systematically excluded. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60 (1942), dealt with allegations that the only women selected for jury service were members of a private organization which had conducted pro-prosecution classes for prospective jurors. Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443 (1953), rejected the equal protection and due process contentions of several black defendants that members of their race had been discriminatorily excluded from their juries. Carter v. Jury Comm'n, 396 U.S. 320 (1970), similarly dealt with equal protection challenges to a jury-selection system, but the persons claiming such rights were blacks who had sought to serve as jurors.
In Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U.S. 57 (1961), this Court gave plenary consideration to contentions that a system such as Louisiana's deprived a defendant of equal protection and due process. These contentions were rejected, despite circumstances which were much more suggestive of possible bias and prejudice than are those herethe defendant *540 in Hoyt was a woman whose defense to charges of murdering her husband was that she had been driven temporarily insane by his suspected infidelity and by his rejection of her efforts at reconciliation. Id., at 58-59. The complete swing of the judicial pendulum 13 years later must depend for its validity on the proposition that during those years things have changed in constitutionally significant ways. I am not persuaded of the sufficiency of either of the majority's proffered explanations as to intervening events.
The first determinative event, in the Court's view, is Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 (1968). Because the Sixth Amendment was there held applicable to the States, the Court feels free to dismiss Hoyt as a case which dealt with entirely different issueseven though in fact it presented the identical problem. But Duncan's rationale is a good deal less expansive than is suggested by the Court's present interpretation of that case. Duncan rests on the following reasoning:
""The test for determining whether a right extended by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments with respect to federal criminal proceedings is also protected against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment has been phrased in a variety of ways in the opinions of this Court. The question has been asked whether a right is among those `""fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions,""' Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 67 (1932); whether it is `basic in our system of jurisprudence,' In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 273 (1948); and whether it is `a fundamental right, essential to a fair trial,' Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 343-344 (1963); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 6 (1964); Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 403 (1965). . . . Because we believe that trial by *541 jury in criminal cases is fundamental to the American scheme of justice, we hold that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees a right of jury trial in all criminal cases . . . ."" Id., at 148-149. (Emphasis added.)
That this is a sturdy test, one not readily satisfied by every discrepancy between federal and state practice, was made clear not only in Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78 (1970), and Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404 (1972), but also in Duncan itself. In explaining the conclusion that a jury trial is fundamental to our scheme of justice, and therefore should be required of the States, the Court pointed out that jury trial was designed to be a defense ""against arbitrary law enforcement,"" 391 U.S., at 156, and ""to prevent oppression by the Government."" Id., at 155. The Court stated its belief that jury trial for serious offenses is ""essential for preventing miscarriages of justice and for assuring that fair trials are provided for all defendants."" Id., at 158.
I cannot conceive that today's decision is necessary to guard against oppressive or arbitrary law enforcement, or to prevent miscarriages of justice and to assure fair trials. Especially is this so when the criminal defendant involved makes no claims of prejudice or bias. The Court does accord some slight attention to justifying its ruling in terms of the basis on which the right to jury trial was read into the Fourteenth Amendment. It concludes that the jury is not effective, as a prophylaxis against arbitrary prosecutorial and judicial power, if the ""jury pool is made up of only special segments of the populace or if large, distinctive groups are excluded from the pool."" Ante, at 530. It fails, however, to provide any satisfactory explanation of the mechanism by which the Louisiana system undermines the prophylactic role of the jury, either in general or in this case. The best it can do is to *542 posit "" `a flavor, a distinct quality,' "" which allegedly is lost if either sex is excluded. Ante, at 532. However, this ""flavor"" is not of such importance that the Constitution is offended if any given petit jury is not so enriched. Ante, at 538. This smacks more of mysticism than of law. The Court does not even purport to practice its mysticism in a consistent fashionpresumably doctors, lawyers, and other groups, whose frequent exemption from jury service is endorsed by the majority, also offer qualities as distinct and important as those at issue here.
In Hoyt, this Court considered a stronger due process claim than is before it today, but found that fundamental fairness had not been offended. I do not understand how our intervening decision in Duncan can support a different result. After all, Duncan imported the Sixth Amendment into the Due Process Clause only because, and only to the extent that, this was perceived to be required by fundamental fairness.
The second change since Hoyt that appears to under-gird the Court's turnabout is societal in nature, encompassing both our higher degree of sensitivity to distinctions based on sex, and the ""evolving nature of the structure of the family unit in American society."" Ante, at 535 n. 17. These are matters of degree, and it is perhaps of some significance that in 1961 Mr. Justice Harlan saw fit to refer to the ""enlightened emancipation of women from the restrictions and protections of bygone years, and their entry into many parts of community life formerly considered to be reserved to men."" Hoyt, 368 U. S., at 61-62. Nonetheless, it may be fair to conclude that the Louisiana system is in fact an anachronism, inappropriate at this ""time or place."" Ante, at 537. But surely constitutional adjudication is a more canalized function than enforcing as against the States this Court's perception of modern life.
*543 Absent any suggestion that appellant's trial was unfairly conducted, or that its result was unreliable, I would not require Louisiana to retry him (assuming the State can once again produce its evidence and witnesses) in order to impose on him the sanctions which its laws provide.
"
5672,Justice Blackmun,majority,False,Bigelow v. Virginia,,1975,2.0,"An advertisement carried in appellant's newspaper led to his conviction for a violation of a Virginia statute that made it a misdemeanor, by the sale or circulation of any publication, to encourage or prompt the procuring of an abortion. The issue here is whether the editor-appellant's First Amendment rights were unconstitutionally abridged by the statute. The First Amendment, of course, is applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147, 160 (1939).

I
The Virginia Weekly was a newspaper published by the Virginia Weekly Associates of Charlottesville. It was issued in that city and circulated in Albemarle County, with particular focus on the campus of the University of Virginia. Appellant, Jeffrey C. Bigelow, was a director and the managing editor and responsible officer of the newspaper.[1]
On February 8, 1971, the Weekly's Vol. V, No. 6, was published and circulated under the direct responsibility *812 of the appellant. On page 2 of that issue was the following advertisement:
                      ""UNWANTED PREGNANCY
                        LET US HELP YOU
             Abortions are now legal in New York.
             There are no residency requirements.

                      515 Madison Avenue

                       or call any time
               (212) 371-6670 or (212) 371-6650
                    AVAILABLE 7 DAYS A WEEK
              STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL. We will make
             all arrangements for you and help you
               with information and counseling.""
It is to be observed that the advertisement announced that the Women's Pavilion of New York City would help women with unwanted pregnancies to obtain ""immediate placement in accredited hospitals and clinics at low cost"" and would ""make all arrangements"" on a ""strictly confidential"" basis; that it offered ""information and counseling""; that it gave the organization's address and telephone numbers; and that it stated that abortions ""are now legal in New York"" and there ""are no residency requirements."" Although the advertisement did not contain the name of any licensed physician, the ""placement"" to which it referred was to ""accredited hospitals and clinics.""
On May 13 Bigelow was charged with violating Va. Code Ann. § 18.1-63 (1960). The statute at that time read:
""If any person, by publication, lecture, advertisement, or by the sale or circulation of any publication, or in any other manner, encourage or prompt *813 the procuring of abortion or miscarriage, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.""[2]
Shortly after the statute was utilized in Bigelow's case, and apparently before it was ever used again, the Virginia Legislature amended it and changed its prior application and scope.[3]
Appellant was first tried and convicted in the County Court of Albemarle County. He appealed to the Circuit Court of that county where he was entitled to a de novo trial. Va. Code Ann. §§ 16.1-132 and 16.1-136 (1960). In the Circuit Court he waived a jury and in July 1971 *814 was tried to the judge. The evidence consisted of stipulated facts; an excerpt, containing the advertisement in question, from the Weekly's issue of February 8, 1971; and the June 1971 issue of Redbook magazine, containing abortion information and distributed in Virginia and in Albemarle County. App. 3, 8. The court rejected appellant's claim that the statute was unconstitutional and adjudged him guilty. He was sentenced to pay a fine of $500, with $350 thereof suspended ""conditioned upon no further violation"" of the statute. Id., at 5.
The Supreme Court of Virginia granted review and, by a 4-2 vote, affirmed Bigelow's conviction. 213 Va. 191, 191 S.E.2d 173 (1972). The court first rejected the appellant's claim that the advertisement was purely informational and thus was not within the ""encourage or prompt"" language of the statute. It held, instead, that the advertisement ""clearly exceeded an informational status"" and ""constituted an active offer to perform a service, rather than a passive statement of fact."" Id., at 193, 191 S.E.2d, at 174. It then rejected Bigelow's First Amendment claim. This, the court said, was a ""commercial advertisement"" and, as such, ""may be constitutionally prohibited by the state,"" particularly ""where, as here, the advertising relates to the medical-health field."" Id., at 193-195, 191 S.E.2d, at 174-176. The issue, in the court's view, was whether the statute was a valid exercise of the State's police power. It answered this question in the affirmative, noting that the statute's goal was ""to ensure that pregnant women in Virginia who decided to have abortions come to their decisions without the commercial advertising pressure usually incidental to the sale of a box of soap powder."" Id., at 196, 191 S.E.2d, at 176. The court then turned to Bigelow's claim of overbreadth. It held that because the *815 appellant himself lacked a legitimate First Amendment interest, inasmuch as his activity ""was of a purely commercial nature,"" he had no ""standing to rely upon the hypothetical rights of those in the non-commercial zone."" Id., at 198, 191 S.E.2d, at 177-178.
Bigelow took a timely appeal to this Court. During the pendency of his appeal, Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179 (1973), were decided. We subsequently vacated Bigelow's judgment of conviction and remanded the case for further consideration in the light of Roe and Doe. 413 U.S. 909 (1973).[4]
The Supreme Court of Virginia, on such reconsideration, but without further oral argument, again affirmed appellant's conviction, observing that neither Roe nor Doe ""mentioned the subject of abortion advertising"" and finding nothing in those decisions ""which in any way affects our earlier view.""[5] 214 Va. 341, 342, 200 S.E.2d 680 (1973). Once again, Bigelow appealed. We noted probable jurisdiction in order to review the important First Amendment issue presented. 418 U.S. 909 (1974).

II
This Court often has recognized that a defendant's standing to challenge a statute on First Amendment grounds as facially overbroad does not depend upon whether his own activity is shown to be constitutionally privileged. The Court consistently has permitted ""attacks on overly broad statutes with no requirement that the person making the attack demonstrate that his own *816 conduct could not be regulated by a statute drawn with the requisite narrow specificity."" Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 486 (1965). See also Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 114 (1972); Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S. 518, 520-521 (1972); Coates v. City of Cincinnati, 402 U.S. 611, 616 (1971), and id., at 619-620 (WHITE, J., dissenting); NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 432 (1963); Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88, 97-98 (1940). The Supreme Court of Virginia itself recognized this principle when it recently stated that ""persons who engage in non-privileged conduct are not precluded from attacking a statute under which they were convicted."" Owens v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 633, 638-639, 179 S.E.2d 477, 481 (1971). ""For in appraising a statute's inhibitory effect upon [First Amendment] rights, this Court has not hesitated to take into account possible applications of the statute in other factual contexts besides that at bar."" NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S., at 432. See generally Note, The First Amendment Overbreadth Doctrine, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 844, 847-848 (1970).
This ""exception to the usual rules governing standing,"" Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S., at 486, reflects the transcendent value to all society of constitutionally protected expression. We give a defendant standing to challenge a statute on grounds that it is facially overbroad, regardless of whether his own conduct could be regulated by a more narrowly drawn statute, because of the ""danger of tolerating, in the area of First Amendment freedoms, the existence of a penal statute susceptible of sweeping and improper application."" NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S., at 433.
Of course, in order to have standing, an individual must present more than ""[a]llegations of a subjective `chill.' "" There must be a ""claim of specific present objective *817 harm or a threat of specific future harm."" Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 13-14 (1972). That requirement, however, surely is met under the circumstances of this case, where the threat of prosecution already has blossomed into the reality of a conviction, and where there can be no doubt concerning the appellant's personal stake in the outcome of the controversy. See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962). The injury of which appellant complains is one to him as an editor and publisher of a newspaper; he is not seeking to raise the hypothetical rights of others. See Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 166 (1972); Breard v. Alexandria, 341 U.S. 622, 641 (1951). Indeed, unlike some cases in which the standing issue similarly has been raised, the facts of this case well illustrate ""the statute's potential for sweeping and improper applications."" Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U. S., at 532-533 (BURGER, C. J., dissenting).
Declaring a statute facially unconstitutional because of overbreadth ""is, manifestly, strong medicine,"" and ""has been employed by the Court sparingly and only as a last resort."" Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 613 (1973). But we conclude that the Virginia courts erred in denying Bigelow standing to make this claim, where ""pure speech"" rather than conduct was involved, without any consideration of whether the alleged overbreadth was or was not substantial. Id., at 615, 616. The Supreme Court of Virginia placed no effective limiting construction on the statute. Indeed, it characterized the rights of doctors, husbands, and lecturers as ""hypothetical,"" and thus seemed to imply that, although these were in the noncommercial zone, the statute might apply to them, too.
In view of the statute's amendment since Bigelow's conviction in such a way as ""effectively to repeal"" its prior application, there is no possibility now that the *818 statute's pre-1972 form will be applied again to appellant or will chill the rights of others. As a practical matter, the issue of its overbreadth has become moot for the future. We therefore decline to rest our decision on overbreadth and we pass on to the further inquiry, of greater moment not only for Bigelow but for others, whether the statute as applied to appellant infringed constitutionally protected speech.

III
A. The central assumption made by the Supreme Court of Virginia was that the First Amendment guarantees of speech and press are inapplicable to paid commercial advertisements. Our cases, however, clearly establish that speech is not stripped of First Amendment protection merely because it appears in that form. Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Rel. Comm'n, 413 U.S. 376, 384 (1973); New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 266 (1964).
The fact that the particular advertisement in appellant's newspaper had commercial aspects or reflected the advertiser's commercial interests did not negate all First Amendment guarantees. The State was not free of constitutional restraint merely because the advertisement involved sales or ""solicitations,"" Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105, 110-111 (1943), or because appellant was paid for printing it, New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S., at 266; Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147, 150 (1959), or because appellant's motive or the motive of the advertiser may have involved financial gain, Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 531 (1945). The existence of ""commercial activity, in itself, is no justification for narrowing the protection of expression secured by the First Amendment."" Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463, 474 (1966).
*819 Although other categories of speechsuch as fighting words, Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 572 (1942), or obscenity, Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 481-485 (1957), Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 23 (1973), or libel, Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323 (1974), or incitement, Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969)have been held unprotected, no contention has been made that the particular speech embraced in the advertisement in question is within any of these categories.
The appellee, as did the Supreme Court of Virginia, relies on Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U.S. 52 (1942), where a unanimous Court, in a brief opinion, sustained an ordinance which had been interpreted to ban the distribution of a handbill advertising the exhibition of a submarine. The handbill solicited customers to tour the ship for a fee. The promoter-advertiser had first attempted to distribute a single-faced handbill consisting only of the advertisement, and was denied permission to do so. He then had printed, on the reverse side of the handbill, a protest against official conduct refusing him the use of wharfage facilities. The Court found that the message of asserted ""public interest"" was appended solely for the purpose of evading the ordinance and therefore did not constitute an ""exercise of the freedom of communicating information and disseminating opinion."" Id., at 54. It said:
""We are equally clear that the Constitution imposes no such restraint on government as respects purely commercial advertising."" Ibid.

But the holding is distinctly a limited one: the ordinance was upheld as a reasonable regulation of the manner in which commercial advertising could be distributed. The fact that it had the effect of banning a particular handbill does not mean that Chrestensen is *820 authority for the proposition that all statutes regulating commercial advertising are immune from constitutional challenge. The case obviously does not support any sweeping proposition that advertising is unprotected per se.[6]
This Court's cases decided since Chrestensen clearly demonstrate as untenable any reading of that case that would give it so broad an effect. In New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, supra, a city official instituted a civil libel action against four clergymen and the New York Times. The suit was based on an advertisement carried in the newspaper criticizing police action against members of the civil rights movement and soliciting contributions for the movement. The Court held that this advertisement, although containing factually erroneous defamatory content, was entitled to the same degree of constitutional protection as ordinary speech. It said:
""That the Times was paid for publishing the advertisement is as immaterial in this connection as is the fact that newspapers and books are sold."" 376 U.S., at 266.
Chrestensen was distinguished on the ground that the handbill advertisement there did no more than propose *821 a purely commercial transaction, whereas the one in New York Times
""communicated information, expressed opinion, recited grievances, protested claimed abuses, and sought financial support on behalf of a movement whose existence and objectives are matters of the highest public interest and concern."" Ibid.

The principle that commercial advertising enjoys a degree of First Amendment protection was reaffirmed in Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Rel. Comm'n, 413 U.S. 376 (1973). There, the Court, although divided, sustained an ordinance that had been construed to forbid newspapers to carry help-wanted advertisements in sex-designated columns except where based upon a bona fide occupational exemption. The Court did describe the advertisements at issue as ""classic examples of commercial speech,"" for each was ""no more than a proposal of possible employment."" Id., at 385. But the Court indicated that the advertisements would have received some degree of First Amendment protection if the commercial proposal had been legal. The illegality of the advertised activity was particularly stressed:
""Any First Amendment interest which might be served by advertising an ordinary commercial proposal and which might arguably outweigh the governmental interest supporting the regulation is altogether absent when the commercial activity itself is illegal and the restriction on advertising is incidental to a valid limitation on economic activity."" Id., at 389.
B. The legitimacy of appellant's First Amendment claim in the present case is demonstrated by the important differences between the advertisement presently at *822 issue and those involved in Chrestensen and in Pittsburgh Press. The advertisement published in appellant's newspaper did more than simply propose a commercial transaction. It contained factual material of clear ""public interest."" Portions of its message, most prominently the lines, ""Abortions are now legal in New York. There are no residency requirements,"" involve the exercise of the freedom of communicating information and disseminating opinion.
Viewed in its entirety, the advertisement conveyed information of potential interest and value to a diverse audiencenot only to readers possibly in need of the services offered, but also to those with a general curiosity about, or genuine interest in, the subject matter or the law of another State and its development, and to readers seeking reform in Virginia. The mere existence of the Women's Pavilion in New York City, with the possibility of its being typical of other organizations there, and the availability of the services offered, were not unnewsworthy. Also, the activity advertised pertained to constitutional interests. See Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179 (1973). Thus, in this case, appellant's First Amendment interests coincided with the constitutional interests of the general public.[7]
Moreover, the placement services advertised in appellant's newspaper were legally provided in New York at that time.[8] The Virginia Legislature could not have *823 regulated the advertiser's activity in New York, and obviously could not have proscribed the activity in that State.[9]Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U.S. 657, 669 (1892). *824 Neither could Virginia prevent its residents from traveling to New York to obtain those services or, as the State conceded, Tr. of Oral Arg. 29, prosecute them for going there. See United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 757-759 (1966); Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 629-631 (1969); Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S., at 200. Virginia possessed no authority to regulate the services provided in New Yorkthe skills and credentials of the New York physicians and of the New York professionals who assisted them, the standards of the New York hospitals and clinics to which patients were referred, or the practices and charges of the New York referral services.
A State does not acquire power or supervision over the internal affairs of another State merely because the welfare and health of its own citizens may be affected when they travel to that State. It may seek to disseminate information so as to enable its citizens to make better informed decisions when they leave. But it may not, under the guise of exercising internal police powers, bar *825 a citizen of another State from disseminating information about an activity that is legal in that State.
C. We conclude, therefore, that the Virginia courts erred in their assumptions that advertising, as such, was entitled to no First Amendment protection and that appellant Bigelow had no legitimate First Amendment interest. We need not decide in this case the precise extent to which the First Amendment permits regulation of advertising that is related to activities the State may legitimately regulate or even prohibit.[10]
*826 Advertising, like all public expression, may be subject to reasonable regulation that serves a legitimate public interest. See Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Rel. Comm'n, supra; Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298 (1974).[11] To the extent that commercial activity is subject to regulation, the relationship of speech to that activity may be one factor, among others, to be considered in weighing the First Amendment interest against the governmental interest alleged. Advertising is not thereby stripped of all First Amendment protection. The relationship of speech to the marketplace of products or of services does not make it valueless in the marketplace of ideas.
The Court has stated that ""a State cannot foreclose the exercise of constitutional rights by mere labels."" NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S., at 429. Regardless of the particular label asserted by the Statewhether it calls speech ""commercial"" or ""commercial advertising"" or ""solicitation"" a court may not escape the task of assessing the First Amendment interest at stake and weighing it against the public interest allegedly served by the regulation. The diverse motives, means, and messages of advertising may make speech ""commercial"" in widely varying degrees. We need not decide here the extent to which constitutional protection is afforded commercial advertising under all circumstances and in the face of all kinds of regulation.

IV
The task of balancing the interests at stake here was one that should have been undertaken by the Virginia courts before they reached their decision. We need not *827 remand for that purpose, however, because the outcome is readily apparent from what has been said above.
In support of the statute, the appellee contends that the commercial operations of abortion referral agencies are associated with practices, such as fee splitting, that tend to diminish, or at least adversely affect, the quality of medical care, and that advertising of these operations will lead women to seek services from those who are interested only or mainly in financial gain apart from professional integrity and responsibility.
The State, of course, has a legitimate interest in maintaining the quality of medical care provided within its borders. Barsky v. Board of Regents, 347 U.S. 442, 451 (1954). No claim has been made, however, that this particular advertisement in any way affected the quality of medical services within Virginia. As applied to Bigelow's case, the statute was directed at the publishing of informative material relating to services offered in another State and was not directed at advertising by a referral agency or a practitioner whose activity Virginia had authority or power to regulate.
To be sure, the agency-advertiser's practices, although not then illegal, may later have proved to be at least ""inimical to the public interest"" in New York. S. P. S. Consultants, Inc. v. Lefkowitz, 333 F. Supp. 1373, 1378 (SDNY 1971).[12] But this development would not justify a Virginia statute that forbids Virginians from using in New York the then legal services of a local New York agency. Here, Virginia is really asserting an interest in regulating what Virginians may hear or read about the New York services. It is, in effect, advancing an interest in shielding its citizens from information about activities *828 outside Virginia's borders, activities that Virginia's police powers do not reach. This asserted interest, even if understandable, was entitled to little, if any, weight under the circumstances.
No claim has been made, nor could any be supported on this record, that the advertisement was deceptive or fraudulent,[13] or that it related to a commodity or service that was then illegal in either Virginia or in New York, or that it otherwise furthered a criminal scheme in Virginia.[14] There was no possibility that appellant's activity would invade the privacy of other citizens, Breard v. Alexandria, supra, or infringe on other rights. Observers would not have the advertiser's message thrust upon them as a captive audience. Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, supra; Packer Corp. v. Utah, 285 U.S. 105, 110 (1932).
The strength of appellant's interest was augmented by the fact that the statute was applied against him as publisher and editor of a newspaper, not against the advertiser or a referral agency or a practitioner. The prosecution thus incurred more serious First Amendment overtones.
If application of this statute were upheld under these circumstances, Virginia might exert the power sought here over a wide variety of national publications or interstate newspapers carrying advertisements similar to the one that appeared in Bigelow's newspaper or containing articles on the general subject matter to which *829 the advertisement referred.[15] Other States might do the same. The burdens thereby imposed on publications would impair, perhaps severely, their proper functioning. See Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241, 257-258 (1974). We know from experience that ""liberty of the press is in peril as soon as the government tries to compel what is to go into a newspaper."" 2 Z. Chafee, Government and Mass Communications 633 (1947). The policy of the First Amendment favors dissemination of information and opinion, and ""[t]he guarantees of freedom of speech and press were not designed to prevent `the censorship of the press merely, but any action of the government by means of which it might prevent such free and general discussion of public matters as seems absolutely essential . . . .' 2 Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 886 (8th ed.)."" Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130, 150 (1967) (opinion of Harlan, J.).
We conclude that Virginia could not apply Va. Code Ann. § 18.1-63 (1960), as it read in 1971, to appellant's publication of the advertisement in question without unconstitutionally infringing upon his First Amendment rights. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia is therefore reversed.
It is so ordered.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom MR."
30184,Justice Burger,dissenting,False,Craig v. Boren,,1976,2.0,"I am in general agreement with MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST'S dissent, but even at the risk of compounding the obvious confusion created by those voting to reverse the District Court, I will add a few words.
At the outset I cannot agree that appellant Whitener has standing arising from her status as a saloonkeeper to assert the constitutional rights of her customers. In this Court ""a litigant may only assert his own constitutional rights or immunities."" United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 22 (1960). There are a few, but strictly limited exceptions to that rule; despite the most creative efforts, this case fits within none of them.
*216 This is not Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, 396 U.S. 229 (1969), or Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U.S. 249 (1953), for there is here no barrier whatever to Oklahoma males 18-20 years of age asserting, in an appropriate forum, any constitutional rights they may claim to purchase 3.2% beer. Craig's successful litigation of this very issue was prevented only by the advent of his 21st birthday. There is thus no danger of interminable dilution of those rights if appellant Whitener is not permitted to litigate them here. Cf. Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 445-446 (1972).
Nor is this controlled by Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965). It borders on the ludicrous to draw a parallel between a vendor of beer and the intimate professional physician-patient relationship which undergirded relaxation of standing rules in that case.
Even in Eisenstadt, the Court carefully limited its recognition of third-party standing to cases in which the relationship between the claimant and the relevant third party ""was not simply the fortuitous connection between a vendor and potential vendees, but the relationship between one who acted to protect the rights of a minority and the minority itself."" 405 U.S., at 445. This is plainly not the case here. See also McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 429-430 (1961); Brown v. United States, 411 U.S. 223, 230 (1973).
In sum, permitting a vendor to assert the constitutional rights of vendees whenever those rights are arguably infringed introduces a new concept of constitutional standing to which I cannot subscribe.
On the merits, we have only recently recognized that our duty is not ""to create substantive constitutional rights in the name of guaranteeing equal protection of the laws."" San Antonio School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 33 (1973). Thus, even interests of such importance in our society as public education and housing do not qualify as ""fundamental rights"" for equal protection purposes because they have no *217 textually independent constitutional status. See id., at 29-39 (education); Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56 (1972) (housing). Though today's decision does not go so far as to make gender-based classifications ""suspect,"" it makes gender a disfavored classification. Without an independent constitutional basis supporting the right asserted or disfavoring the classification adopted, I can justify no substantive constitutional protection other than the normal McGowan v. Maryland, supra, at 425-426, protection afforded by the Equal Protection Clause.
The means employed by the Oklahoma Legislature to achieve the objectives sought may not be agreeable to some judges, but since eight Members of the Court think the means not irrational, I see no basis for striking down the statute as violative of the Constitution simply because we find it unwise, unneeded, or possibly even a bit foolish.
With MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.
MR."
30185,Justice Rehnquist,second_dissenting,False,Craig v. Boren,,1976,2.0,"The Court's disposition of this case is objectionable on two grounds. First is its conclusion that men challenging a gender-based statute which treats them less favorably than women may invoke a more stringent standard of judicial review than pertains to most other types of classifications. Second is the Court's enunciation of this standard, without citation to any source, as being that ""classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives."" Ante, at 197 (emphasis added). The only redeeming feature of the Court's opinion, to my mind, is that it apparently signals a retreat by those who joined the plurality opinion in Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973), from their view that sex is a ""suspect"" classification for purposes of equal protection analysis. I think the Oklahoma statute challenged here need pass only the ""rational basis"" equal *218 protection analysis expounded in cases such as McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420 (1961), and Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483 (1955), and I believe that it is constitutional under that analysis.

I
In Frontiero v. Richardson, supra, the opinion for the plurality sets forth the reasons of four Justices for concluding that sex should be regarded as a suspect classification for purposes of equal protection analysis. These reasons center on our Nation's ""long and unfortunate history of sex discrimination,"" 411 U.S., at 684, which has been reflected in a whole range of restrictions on the legal rights of women, not the least of which have concerned the ownership of property and participation in the electoral process. Noting that the pervasive and persistent nature of the discrimination experienced by women is in part the result of their ready identifiability, the plurality rested its invocation of strict scrutiny largely upon the fact that ""statutory distinctions between the sexes often have the effect of invidiously relegating the entire class of females to inferior legal status without regard to the actual capabilities of its individual members."" Id., at 686-687. See Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U.S. 7, 14-15 (1975).
Subsequent to Frontiero, the Court has declined to hold that sex is a suspect class, Stanton v. Stanton, supra, at 13, and no such holding is imported by the Court's resolution of this case. However, the Court's application here of an elevated or ""intermediate"" level scrutiny, like that invoked in cases dealing with discrimination against females, raises the question of why the statute here should be treated any differently from countless legislative classifications unrelated to sex which have been upheld under a minimum rationality standard. Jefferson v. Hackney, 406 U.S. 535, 546-547 (1972); Richardson v. Belcher, 404 U.S. 78, 81-84 (1971); Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 484-485 (1970); *219 McGowan v. Maryland, supra, at 425-426; Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 611 (1960); Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., supra, at 488-489.
Most obviously unavailable to support any kind of special scrutiny in this case, is a history or pattern of past discrimination, such as was relied on by the plurality in Frontiero to support its invocation of strict scrutiny. There is no suggestion in the Court's opinion that males in this age group are in any way peculiarly disadvantaged, subject to systematic discriminatory treatment, or otherwise in need of special solicitude from the courts.
The Court does not discuss the nature of the right involved, and there is no reason to believe that it sees the purchase of 3.2% beer as implicating any important interest, let alone one that is ""fundamental"" in the constitutional sense of invoking strict scrutiny. Indeed, the Court's accurate observation that the statute affects the selling but not the drinking of 3.2% beer, ante, at 204, further emphasizes the limited effect that it has on even those persons in the age group involved. There is, in sum, nothing about the statutory classification involved here to suggest that it affects an interest, or works against a group, which can claim under the Equal Protection Clause that it is entitled to special judicial protection.
It is true that a number of our opinions contain broadly phrased dicta implying that the same test should be applied to all classifications based on sex, whether affecting females or males. E. g., Frontiero v. Richardson, supra, at 688; Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 76 (1971). However, before today, no decision of this Court has applied an elevated level of scrutiny to invalidate a statutory discrimination harmful to males, except where the statute impaired an important personal interest protected by the Constitution.[1] There being no such interest *220 here, and there being no plausible argument that this is a discrimination against females,[2] the Court's reliance on our previous sex-discrimination cases is ill-founded. It treats gender classification as a talisman whichwithout regard to the rights involved or the persons affectedcalls into effect a heavier burden of judicial review.
The Court's conclusion that a law which treats males less favorably than females ""must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives"" apparently comes out of thin air. The Equal Protection Clause contains no such language, and none of our previous cases adopt that standard. I would think we have had enough difficulty with the two standards of review which our cases have recognizedthe *221 norm of ""rational basis,"" and the ""compelling state interest"" required where a ""suspect classification"" is involvedso as to counsel weightily against the insertion of still another ""standard"" between those two. How is this Court to divine what objectives are important? How is it to determine whether a particular law is ""substantially"" related to the achievement of such objective, rather than related in some other way to its achievement? Both of the phrases used are so diaphanous and elastic as to invite subjective judicial preferences or prejudices relating to particular types of legislation, masquerading as judgments whether such legislation is directed at ""important"" objectives or, whether the relationship to those objectives is ""substantial"" enough.
I would have thought that if this Court were to leave anything to decision by the popularly elected branches of the Government, where no constitutional claim other than that of equal protection is invoked, it would be the decision as to what governmental objectives to be achieved by law are ""important,"" and which are not. As for the second part of the Court's new test, the Judicial Branch is probably in no worse position than the Legislative or Executive Branches to determine if there is any rational relationship between a classification and the purpose which it might be thought to serve. But the introduction of the adverb ""substantially"" requires courts to make subjective judgments as to operational effects, for which neither their expertise nor their access to data fits them. And even if we manage to avoid both confusion and the mirroring of our own preferences in the development of this new doctrine, the thousands of judges in other courts who must interpret the Equal Protection Clause may not be so fortunate.

II
The applicable rational-basis test is one which
""permits the States a wide scope of discretion in enacting laws which affect some groups of citizens differently than *222 others. The constitutional safeguard is offended only if the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State's objective. State legislatures are presumed to have acted within their constitutional power despite the fact that, in practice, their laws result in some inequality. A statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it."" McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S., at 425-426 (citations omitted).
Our decisions indicate that application of the Equal Protection Clause in a context not justifying an elevated level of scrutiny does not demand ""mathematical nicety"" or the elimination of all inequality. Those cases recognize that the practical problems of government may require rough accommodations of interests, and hold that such accommodations should be respected unless no reasonable basis can be found to support them. Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U. S., at 485. Whether the same ends might have been better or more precisely served by a different approach is no part of the judicial inquiry under the traditional minimum rationality approach. Richardson v. Belcher, 404 U. S., at 84.
The Court ""accept[s] for purposes of discussion"" the District Court's finding that the purpose of the provisions in question was traffic safety, and proceeds to examine the statistical evidence in the record in order to decide if ""the gender-based distinction closely serves to achieve that objective."" Ante, at 199, 200 (emphasis added). (Whether there is a difference between laws which ""closely serv[e]"" objectives and those which are only ""substantially related"" to their achievement, ante, at 197, we are not told.) I believe that a more traditional type of scrutiny is appropriate in this case, and I think that the Court would have done well here to heed its own warning that ""[i]t is unrealistic to expect . . . members of the judiciary . . . to be well versed in the rigors of experimental or statistical technique."" Ante, at 204. One *223 need not immerse oneself in the fine points of statistical analysis, however, in order to see the weaknesses in the Court's attempted denigration of the evidence at hand.
One survey of arrest statistics assembled in 1973 indicated that males in the 18-20 age group were arrested for ""driving under the influence"" almost 18 times as often as their female counterparts, and for ""drunkenness"" in a ratio of almost 10 to 1.[3] Accepting, as the Court does, appellants' comparison of the total figures with 1973 Oklahoma census data, this survey indicates a 2% arrest rate among males in the age group, as compared to a .18% rate among females.
Other surveys indicated (1) that over the five-year period from 1967 to 1972, nationwide arrests among those under 18 for drunken driving increased 138%, and that 93% of all persons arrested for drunken driving were male;[4] (2) that youths in the 17-21 age group were overrepresented among those killed or injured in Oklahoma traffic accidents, that male casualties substantially exceeded female, and that deaths in this age group continued to rise while overall traffic deaths declined;[5] (3) that over three-fourths of the drivers under 20 in the Oklahoma City area are males, and that each of them, on average, drives half again as many miles per year as their female counterparts;[6] (4) that four-fifths of male drivers *224 under 20 in the Oklahoma City area state a drink preference for beer, while about three-fifths of female drivers of that age state the same preference;[7] and (5) that the percentage of male drivers under 20 admitting to drinking within two hours of driving was half again larger than the percentage for females, and that the percentage of male drivers of that age group with a blood alcohol content greater than .01% was almost half again larger than for female drivers.[8]
The Court's criticism of the statistics relied on by the District Court conveys the impression that a legislature in enacting a new law is to be subjected to the judicial equivalent of a doctoral examination in statistics. Legislatures are not held to any rules of evidence such as those which may govern courts or other administrative bodies, and are entitled to draw factual conclusions on the basis of the determination of probable cause which an arrest by a police officer normally represents. In this situation, they could reasonably infer that the incidence of drunk driving is a good deal higher than the incidence of arrest.
And while, as the Court observes, relying on a report to a Presidential Commission which it cites in a footnote, such statistics may be distorted as a result of stereotyping, the legislature is not required to prove before a court that its statistics are perfect. In any event, if stereotypes are as pervasive as the Court suggests, they may in turn influence the conduct of the men and women in question, and cause the young men to conform to the wild and reckless image which is their stereotype.
The Court also complains of insufficient integration of the various surveys on several countsthat the injury and death figures are in no way directly correlated with intoxication, ante, at 201 n. 9; that the national figures for drunk driving contain no breakdown for the 18-21-year-old group, *225 ante, at 201 n. 11; and that the arrest records for intoxication are not tied to the consumption of 3.2% beer, ante, at 201-202, nn. 11 and 12. But the State of Oklahomaand certainly this Court for purposes of equal protection reviewcan surely take notice of the fact that drunkenness is a significant cause of traffic casualties, and that youthful offenders have participated in the increase of the drunk-driving problem. On this latter point, the survey data indicating increased driving casualties among 18-21-year-old, while overall casualties dropped, are not irrelevant.
Nor is it unreasonable to conclude from the expressed preference for beer by four-fifths of the age-group males that that beverage was a predominant source of their intoxication-related arrests. Taking that as the predicate, the State could reasonably bar those males from any purchases of alcoholic beer, including that of the 3.2% variety. This Court lacks the expertise or the data to evaluate the intoxicating properties of that beverage, and in that posture our only appropriate course is to defer to the reasonable inference supporting the statutethat taken in sufficient quantity this beer has the same effect as any alcoholic beverage.
Quite apart from these alleged methodological deficiencies in the statistical evidence, the Court appears to hold that that evidence, on its face, fails to support the distinction drawn in the statute. The Court notes that only 2% of males (as against .18% of females) in the age group were arrested for drunk driving, and that this very low figure establishes ""an unduly tenuous `fit'"" between maleness and drunk driving in the 18-20-year-old group. On this point the Court misconceives the nature of the equal protection inquiry.
The rationality of a statutory classification for equal protection purposes does not depend upon the statistical ""fit"" between the class and the trait sought to be singled out. It turns on whether there may be a sufficiently higher incidence *226 of the trait within the included class than in the excluded class to justify different treatment. Therefore the present equal protection challenge to this gender-based discrimination poses only the question whether the incidence of drunk driving among young men is sufficiently greater than among young women to justify differential treatment. Notwithstanding the Court's critique of the statistical evidence, that evidence suggests clear differences between the drinking and driving habits of young men and women. Those differences are grounds enough for the State reasonably to conclude that young males pose by far the greater drunk-driving hazard, both in terms of sheer numbers and in terms of hazard on a per-driver basis. The gender-based difference in treatment in this case is therefore not irrational.
The Court's argument that a 2% correlation between maleness and drunk driving is constitutionally insufficient therefore does not pose an equal protection issue concerning discrimination between males and females. The clearest demonstration of this is the fact that the precise argument made by the Court would be equally applicable to a flat bar on such purchases by anyone, male or female, in the 18-20 age group; in fact it would apply a fortiori in that case given the even more ""tenuous `fit'"" between drunk-driving arrests and femaleness. The statistics indicate that about 1% of the age group population as a whole is arrested. What the Court's argument is relevant to is not equal protection, but due processwhether there are enough persons in the category who drive while drunk to justify a bar against purchases by all members of the group.
Cast in those terms, the argument carries little weight, in light of our decisions indicating that such questions call for a balance of the State's interest against the harm resulting from any overinclusiveness or underinclusiveness. Vlandis v. Kline, 412 U.S. 441, 448-452 (1973). The personal interest harmed *227 here is very minorthe present legislation implicates only the right to purchase 3.2% beer, certainly a far cry from the important personal interests which have on occasion supported this Court's invalidation of statutes on similar reasoning. Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, 414 U.S. 632, 640 (1974); Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651 (1972). And the state interest involved is significantthe prevention of injury and death on the highways.
This is not a case where the classification can only be justified on grounds of administrative convenience. Vlandis v. Kline, supra, at 451; Stanley v. Illinois, supra, at 656. There being no apparent way to single out persons likely to drink and drive, it seems plain that the legislature was faced here with the not atypical legislative problem of legislating in terms of broad categories with regard to the purchase and consumption of alcohol. I trust, especially in light of the Twenty-first Amendment, that there would be no due process violation if no one in this age group were allowed to purchase 3.2% beer. Since males drink and drive at a higher rate than the age group as a whole, I fail to see how a statutory bar with regard only to them can create any due process problem.
The Oklahoma Legislature could have believed that 18-20-year-old males drive substantially more, and tend more often to be intoxicated than their female counterparts; that they prefer beer and admit to drinking and driving at a higher rate than females; and that they suffer traffic injuries out of proportion to the part they make up of the population. Under the appropriate rational-basis test for equal protection, it is neither irrational nor arbitrary to bar them from making purchases of 3.2% beer, which purchases might in many cases be made by a young man who immediately returns to his vehicle with the beverage in his possession. The record does not give any good indication of the true proportion of males in the age group who drink and drive (except *228 that it is no doubt greater than the 2% who are arrested), but whatever it may be I cannot see that the mere purchase right involved could conceivably raise a due process question. There being no violation of either equal protection or due process, the statute should accordingly be upheld.
"
30183,Justice Powell,concurring,False,Craig v. Boren,,1976,2.0,"I join the opinion of the Court as I am in general agreement with it. I do have reservations as to some of the discussion concerning the appropriate standard for equal protection analysis and the relevance of the statistical evidence. Accordingly, I add this concurring statement.
With respect to the equal protection standard, I agree that Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), is the most relevant precedent. But I find it unnecessary, in deciding this case, to read that decision as broadly as some of the Court's language may imply. Reed and subsequent cases involving gender-based classifications make clear that the Court subjects such classifications to a more critical examination than is normally applied when ""fundamental"" constitutional rights and ""suspect classes"" are not present.[*]
*211 I view this as a relatively easy case. No one questions the legitimacy or importance of the asserted governmental objective: the promotion of highway safety. The decision of the case turns on whether the state legislature, by the classification it has chosen, has adopted a means that bears a ""`fair and substantial relation'"" to this objective. Id., at 76, quoting Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U.S. 412, 415 (1920).
It seems to me that the statistics offered by appellees and relied upon by the District Court do tend generally to support the view that young men drive more, possibly are inclined to drink more, andfor various reasonsare involved in more accidents than young women. Even so, I am not persuaded that these facts and the inferences fairly drawn from them justify this classification based on a three-year age differential between the sexes, and especially one that is so easily circumvented as to be virtually meaningless. Putting it differently, this gender-based classification does not bear a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation.
MR."
30182,Justice Brennan,majority,False,Craig v. Boren,,1976,2.0,"The interaction of two sections of an Oklahoma statute, Okla. Stat., Tit. 37, §§ 241 and 245 (1958 and Supp. 1976),[1]*192 prohibits the sale of ""nonintoxicating"" 3.2% beer to males under the age of 21 and to females under the age of 18. The question to be decided is whether such a gender-based differential constitutes a denial to males 18-20 years of age of the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
This action was brought in the District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma on December 20, 1972, by appellant Craig, a male then between 18 and 21 years of age, and by appellant Whitener, a licensed vendor of 3.2% beer. The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of the gender-based differential on the ground that it constituted invidious discrimination against males 18-20 years of age. A three-judge court convened under 28 U.S. C. § 2281 sustained the constitutionality of the statutory differential and dismissed the action. 399 F. Supp. 1304 (1975). We noted probable jurisdiction of appellants' appeal, 423 U.S. 1047 (1976). We reverse.

I
We first address a preliminary question of standing. Appellant Craig attained the age of 21 after we noted probable jurisdiction. Therefore, since only declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of the gender-based differential is sought, the controversy has been rendered moot as to Craig. See, e. g., DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312 (1974).[2] The question thus arises whether appellant Whitener, the licensed vendor of 3.2% beer, who has a live controversy against enforcement of the statute, may rely upon the equal protection objections of males 18-20 years of age to establish her claim of *193 unconstitutionality of the age-sex differential. We conclude that she may.
Initially, it should be noted that, despite having had the opportunity to do so,[3] appellees never raised before the District Court any objection to Whitener's reliance upon the claimed unequal treatment of 18-20-year-old males as the premise of her equal protection challenge to Oklahoma's 3.2% beer law. See 399 F. Supp., at 1306 n. 1. Indeed, at oral argument Oklahoma acknowledged that appellees always ""presumed"" that the vendor, subject to sanctions and loss of license for violation of the statute, was a proper party in interest to object to the enforcement of the sex-based regulatory provision. Tr. of Oral Arg. 41. While such a concession certainly would not be controlling upon the reach of this Court's constitutional authority to exercise jurisdiction under Art. III, see, e. g., Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 732 n. 3 (1972); cf. Data Processing Service v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 151 (1970), our decisions have settled that limitations on a litigant's assertion of jus tertii are not constitutionally mandated, but rather stem from a salutary ""rule of self-restraint"" designed to minimize unwarranted intervention into controversies where the applicable constitutional questions are ill-defined and speculative. See, e. g., Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U.S. 249, 255, 257 (1953); see also Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 123-124 (1976) (POWELL, J., dissenting). These prudential objectives, thought to be enhanced by restrictions on third-party standing, cannot be furthered here, where the lower court already has entertained the relevant constitutional challenge and the parties have soughtor at least have never resistedan authoritative constitutional determination. In such circumstances, a decision by us to forgo *194 consideration of the constitutional merits in order to await the initiation of a new challenge to the statute by injured third parties would be impermissibly to foster repetitive and time-consuming litigation under the guise of caution and prudence. Moreover, insofar as the applicable constitutional questions have been and continue to be presented vigorously and ""cogently,"" Holden v. Hardy, 169 U.S. 366, 397 (1898), the denial of jus tertii standing in deference to a direct class suit can serve no functional purpose. Our Brother BLACKMUN's comment is pertinent: ""[I]t may be that a class could be assembled, whose fluid membership always included some [males] with live claims. But if the assertion of the right is to be `representative' to such an extent anyway, there seems little loss in terms of effective advocacy from allowing its assertion by"" the present jus tertii champion. Singleton v. Wulff, supra, at 117-118.
In any event, we conclude that appellant Whitener has established independently her claim to assert jus tertii standing. The operation of §§ 241 and 245 plainly has inflicted ""injury in fact"" upon appellant sufficient to guarantee her ""concrete adverseness,"" Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962), and to satisfy the constitutionally based standing requirements imposed by Art. III. The legal duties created by the statutory sections under challenge are addressed directly to vendors such as appellant. She is obliged either to heed the statutory discrimination, thereby incurring a direct economic injury through the constriction of her buyers' market, or to disobey the statutory command and suffer, in the words of Oklahoma's Assistant Attorney General, ""sanctions and perhaps loss of license."" Tr. of Oral Arg. 41. This Court repeatedly has recognized that such injuries establish the threshold requirements of a ""case or controversy"" mandated by Art. III. See, e. g., Singleton v. Wulff, supra, at 113 (doctors who receive payments for their abortion services are ""classically adverse"" to government as payer); Sullivan v. Little Hunting *195 Park, 396 U.S. 229, 237 (1969); Barrows v. Jackson, supra, at 255-256.
As a vendor with standing to challenge the lawfulness of §§ 241 and 245, appellant Whitener is entitled to assert those concomitant rights of third parties that would be ""diluted or adversely affected"" should her constitutional challenge fail and the statutes remain in force. Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 481 (1965); see Note, Standing to Assert Constitutional Jus Tertii, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 423, 432 (1974). Otherwise, the threatened imposition of governmental sanctions might deter appellant Whitener and other similarly situated vendors from selling 3.2% beer to young males, thereby ensuring that ""enforcement of the challenged restriction against the [vendor] would result indirectly in the violation of third parties' rights."" Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 510 (1975). Accordingly, vendors and those in like positions have been uniformly permitted to resist efforts at restricting their operations by acting as advocates of the rights of third parties who seek access to their market or function. See, e. g., Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972); Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, supra; Barrows v. Jackson, supra.[4]
*196 Indeed, the jus tertii question raised here is answered by our disposition of a like argument in Eisenstadt v. Baird, supra. There, as here, a state statute imposed legal duties and disabilities upon the claimant, who was convicted of distributing a package of contraceptive foam to a third party.[5] Since the statute was directed at Baird and penalized his conduct, the Court did not hesitateagain as hereto conclude that the ""case or controversy"" requirement of Art. III was satisfied. 405 U.S., at 443. In considering Baird's constitutional objections, the Court fully recognized his standing to defend the privacy interests of third parties. Deemed crucial to the decision to permit jus tertii standing was the recognition of ""the impact of the litigation on the third-party interests."" Id., at 445. Just as the defeat of Baird's suit and the ""[e]nforcement of the Massachusetts statute will materially impair the ability of single persons to obtain contraceptives,"" id., at 446, so too the failure of Whitener to prevail in this suit and the continued enforcement of §§ 241 and 245 will ""materially impair the ability of"" males 18-20 years of age to purchase 3.2% beer despite their classification by an overt gender-based criterion. Similarly, just as the Massachusetts law in Eisenstadt ""prohibit[ed], *197 not use, but distribution,"" 405 U.S., at 446, and consequently the least awkward challenger was one in Baird's position who was subject to that proscription, the law challenged here explicitly regulates the sale rather than use of 3.2% beer, thus leaving a vendor as the obvious claimant.
We therefore hold that Whitener has standing to raise relevant equal protection challenges to Oklahoma's gender-based law. We now consider those arguments.

A
Before 1972, Oklahoma defined the commencement of civil majority at age 18 for females and age 21 for males. Okla. Stat., Tit. 15, § 13 (1972 and Supp. 1976). In contrast, females were held criminally responsible as adults at age 18 and males at age 16. Okla. Stat., Tit. 10, § 1101 (a) (Supp. 1976). After the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held in 1972, on the authority of Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), that the age distinction was unconstitutional for purposes of establishing criminal responsibility as adults, Lamb v. Brown, 456 F.2d 18, the Oklahoma Legislature fixed age 18 as applicable to both males and females. Okla. Stat., Tit. 10, § 1101 (a) (Supp. 1976). In 1972, 18 also was established as the age of majority for males and females in civil matters, Okla. Stat., Tit. 15, § 13 (1972 and Supp. 1976), except that §§ 241 and 245 of the 3.2% beer statute were simultaneously codified to create an exception to the gender-free rule.
Analysis may appropriately begin with the reminder that Reed emphasized that statutory classifications that distinguish between males and females are ""subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause."" 404 U.S., at 75. To withstand constitutional challenge, previous cases establish that classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives. Thus, in Reed, the objectives *198 of ""reducing the workload on probate courts,"" id., at 76, and ""avoiding intrafamily controversy,"" id., at 77, were deemed of insufficient importance to sustain use of an overt gender criterion in the appointment of administrators of intestate decedents' estates. Decisions following Reed similarly have rejected administrative ease and convenience as sufficiently important objectives to justify gender-based classifications. See, e. g., Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 656 (1972); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 690 (1973); cf. Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U.S. 498, 506-507 (1975). And only two Terms ago, Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U.S. 7 (1975), expressly stating that Reed v. Reed was ""controlling,"" 421 U.S., at 13, held that Reed required invalidation of a Utah differential age-of-majority statute, notwithstanding the statute's coincidence with and furtherance of the State's purpose of fostering ""old notions"" of role typing and preparing boys for their expected performance in the economic and political worlds. 421 U.S., at 14-15.[6]
Reed v. Reed has also provided the underpinning for decisions that have invalidated statutes employing gender as an inaccurate proxy for other, more germane bases of classification. Hence, ""archaic and overbroad"" generalizations, Schlesinger v. Ballard, supra, at 508, concerning the financial position of servicewomen, Frontiero v. Richardson, supra, at 689 n. 23, and working women, Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 643 (1975), could not justify use of a gender line in determining eligibility for certain governmental entitlements. Similarly, increasingly outdated *199 misconceptions concerning the role of females in the home rather than in the ""marketplace and world of ideas"" were rejected as loose-fitting characterizations incapable of supporting state statutory schemes that were premised upon their accuracy. Stanton v. Stanton, supra; Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 535 n. 17 (1975). In light of the weak congruence between gender and the characteristic or trait that gender purported to represent, it was necessary that the legislatures choose either to realign their substantive laws in a gender-neutral fashion, or to adopt procedures for identifying those instances where the sex-centered generalization actually comported with fact. See, e. g., Stanley v. Illinois, supra., at 658; cf. Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, 414 U.S. 632, 650 (1974).
In this case, too, ""Reed, we feel, is controlling . . .,"" Stanton v. Stanton, supra, at 13. We turn then to the question whether, under Reed, the difference between males and females with respect to the purchase of 3.2% beer warrants the differential in age drawn by the Oklahoma statute. We conclude that it does not.

B
The District Court recognized that Reed v. Reed was controlling. In applying the teachings of that case, the court found the requisite important governmental objective in the traffic-safety goal proffered by the Oklahoma Attorney General. It then concluded that the statistics introduced by the appellees established that the gender-based distinction was substantially related to achievement of that goal.

C
We accept for purposes of discussion the District Court's identification of the objective underlying §§ 241 and 245 as the enhancement of traffic safety.[7] Clearly, the protection *200 of public health and safety represents an important function of state and local governments. However, appellees' statistics in our view cannot support the conclusion that the gender-based distinction closely serves to achieve that objective and therefore the distinction cannot under Reed withstand equal protection challenge.
The appellees introduced a variety of statistical surveys. First, an analysis of arrest statistics for 1973 demonstrated that 18-20-year-old male arrests for ""driving under the influence"" and ""drunkenness"" substantially exceeded female arrests for that same age period.[8] Similarly, youths aged 17-21 were found to be overrepresented among those killed *201 or injured in traffic accidents, with males again numerically exceeding females in this regard.[9] Third, a random roadside survey in Oklahoma City revealed that young males were more inclined to drive and drink beer than were their female counterparts.[10] Fourth, Federal Bureau of Investigation nationwide statistics exhibited a notable increase in arrests for ""driving under the influence.""[11] Finally, statistical evidence gathered in other jurisdictions, particularly Minnesota and Michigan, was offered to corroborate Oklahoma's experience by indicating the pervasiveness of youthful participation in motor vehicle accidents following the imbibing of alcohol. Conceding that ""the case is not free from doubt,"" 399 F. Supp., at 1314, the District Court nonetheless concluded that this statistical showing substantiated ""a rational basis for the legislative judgment underlying the challenged classification."" Id., at 1307.
Even were this statistical evidence accepted as accurate, it nevertheless offers only a weak answer to the equal protection question presented here. The most focused and relevant of the statistical surveys, arrests of 18-20-year-olds for alcohol-related driving offenses, exemplifies the ultimate unpersuasiveness of this evidentiary record. Viewed in terms of the correlation between sex and the actual activity that Oklahoma seeks to regulatedriving while under the influence of alcoholthe statistics broadly establish that .18% of females and 2% of males in that age group were arrested for that offense. While such a disparity is not trivial in a statistical sense, it hardly can form the basis for employment of a gender line as a classifying device. Certainly if maleness *202 is to serve as a proxy for drinking and driving, a correlation of 2% must be considered an unduly tenuous ""fit.""[12] Indeed, prior cases have consistently rejected the use of sex as a decisionmaking factor even though the statutes in question certainly rested on far more predictive empirical relationships than this.[13]
Moreover, the statistics exhibit a variety of other shortcomings that seriously impugn their value to equal protection analysis. Setting aside the obvious methodological problems,[14] the surveys do not adequately justify the salient *203 features of Oklahoma's gender-based traffic-safety law. None purports to measure the use and dangerousness of 3.2% beer as opposed to alcohol generally, a detail that is of particular importance since, in light of its low alcohol lever, Oklahoma apparently considers the 3.2% beverage to be ""nonintoxicating."" Okla. Stat., Tit. 37, § 163.1 (1958); see State ex rel. Springer v. Bliss, 199 Okla. 198, 185 P.2d 220 (1947). Moreover, many of the studies, while graphically documenting the unfortunate increase in driving while under the influence of alcohol, make no effort to relate their findings to age-sex differential as involved here.[15] Indeed, the only survey that explicitly centered its attention upon young drivers and their use of beeralbeit apparently not of the diluted 3.2% varietyreached results that hardly can be viewed as impressive in justifying either a gender or age classification.[16]
*204 There is no reason to belabor this line of analysis. It is unrealistic to expect either members of the judiciary or state officials to be well versed in the rigors of experimental or statistical technique. But this merely illustrates that proving broad sociological propositions by statistics is a dubious business, and one that inevitably is in tension with the normative philosophy that underlies the Equal Protection Clause.[17] Suffice to say that the showing offered by the appellees does not satisfy us that sex represents a legitimate, accurate proxy for the regulation of drinking and driving. In fact, when it is further recognized that Oklahoma's statute prohibits only the selling of 3.2% beer to young males and not their drinking the beverage once acquired (even after purchase by their 18-20-year-old female companions), the relationship between gender and traffic safety becomes far too tenuous to satisfy Reed's requirement that the gender-based difference be substantially related to achievement of the statutory objective.
We hold, therefore, that under Reed, Oklahoma's 3.2% beer statute invidiously discriminates against males 18-20 years of age.

D
Appellees argue, however, that §§ 241 and 245 enforce state policies concerning the sale and distribution of alcohol and by force of the Twenty-first Amendment should therefore be held to withstand the equal protection challenge. The District Court's response to this contention is unclear. The court assumed that the Twenty-first Amendment ""strengthened"" the State's police powers with respect to alcohol regulation, 399 F. Supp., at 1307, but then said that ""the standards of review that [the Equal Protection Clause] mandates are not relaxed."" Id., at 1308. Our view is, and we hold, that the Twenty-first Amendment does not save the *205 invidious gender-based discrimination from invalidation as a denial of equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The history of state regulation of alcoholic beverages dates from long before adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment. In the License Cases, 5 How. 504, 579 (1847), the Court recognized a broad authority in state governments to regulate the trade of alcoholic beverages within their borders free from implied restrictions under the Commerce Clause. Later in the century, however, Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U.S. 100 (1890), undercut the theoretical underpinnings of the License Cases. This led Congress, acting pursuant to its powers under the Commerce Clause, to reinvigorate the State's regulatory role through the passage of the Wilson[18] and Webb-Kenyon Acts.[19] See, e. g., Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland R. Co., 242 U.S. 311 (1917) (upholding Webb-Kenyon Act); In re Rahrer, 140 U.S. 545 (1891) (upholding Wilson Act). With passage of the Eighteenth Amendment, the uneasy tension between the Commerce Clause and state police power temporarily subsided.
The Twenty-first Amendment repealed the Eighteenth Amendment in 1933. The wording of § 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment[20] closely follows the Webb-Kenyon and Wilson *206 Acts, expressing the framers' clear intention of constitutionalizing the Commerce Clause framework established under those statutes. This Court's decisions since have confirmed that the Amendment primarily created an exception to the normal operation of the Commerce Clause. See, e. g., Hostetter v. Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp., 377 U.S. 324, 330 (1964); Carter v. Virginia, 321 U.S. 131, 139-140 (1944) (Frankfurter, J., concurring); Finch & Co. v. McKittrick, 305 U.S. 395, 398 (1939). Even here, however, the Twenty-first Amendment does not pro tanto repeal the Commerce Clause, but merely requires that each provision ""be considered in the light of the other, and in the context of the issues and interests at stake in any concrete case."" Hostetter v. Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp., supra, at 332; cf. Department of Revenue v. James Beam Distilling Co., 377 U.S. 341 (1964); Collins v. Yosemite Park & Curry Co., 304 U.S. 518 (1938).
Once passing beyond consideration of the Commerce Clause, the relevance of the Twenty-first Amendment to other constitutional provisions becomes increasingly doubtful. As one commentator has remarked: ""Neither the text nor the history of the Twenty-first Amendment suggests that it qualifies individual rights protected by the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment where the sale or use of liquor is concerned."" P. Brest, Processes of Constitutional Decision-making, Cases and Materials, 258 (1975). Any departures from this historical view have been limited and sporadic. Two States successfully relied upon the Twenty-first Amendment to respond to challenges of major liquor importers to state authority to regulate the importation and manufacture of alcoholic beverages on Commerce Clause and Fourteenth Amendment grounds. See Mahoney v. Joseph Triner Corp., 304 U.S. 401 (1938); State Board v. Young's Market Co., *207 299 U.S. 59, 64 (1936). In fact, however, the arguments in both cases centered upon importation of intoxicants, a regulatory area where the State's authority under the Twenty-first Amendment is transparently clear, Hostetter v. Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp., supra, at 330, and n. 9, and touched upon purely economic matters that traditionally merit only the mildest review under the Fourteenth Amendment, see, e. g., Joseph E. Seagram & Sons v. Hostetter, 384 U.S. 35, 47-48, 50-51 (1966) (rejecting Fourteenth Amendment objections to state liquor laws on the strength of Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726, 729-730 (1963) and Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483 (1955)).[21] Cases involving individual rights protected by the Due Process Clause have been treated in sharp contrast. For example, when an individual objected to the mandatory ""posting"" of her name in retail liquor establishments and her characterization as an ""excessive drink[er],"" the Twenty-first Amendment was held not to qualify the scope of her due process rights. Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433, 436 (1971).
It is true that California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109, 115 (1972), relied upon the Twenty-first Amendment to ""strengthen"" the State's authority to regulate live entertainment at establishments licensed to dispense liquor, at least when the performance ""partake more of gross sexuality than of communication,"" id., at 118. Nevertheless, the Court has never recognized sufficient ""strength"" in the Amendment to defeat an otherwise established claim of invidious discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. *208 Rather, Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 178-179 (1972), establishes that state liquor regulatory schemes cannot work invidious discriminations that violate the Equal Protection Clause.
Following this approach, both federal and state courts uniformly have declared the unconstitutionality of gender lines that restrain the activities of customers of state-regulated liquor establishments irrespective of the operation of the Twenty-first Amendment. See, e. g., White v. Fleming, 522 F.2d 730 (CA7 1975); Women's Liberation Union of R. I. v. Israel, 512 F.2d 106 (CA1 1975); Daugherty v. Daley, 370 F. Supp. 338 (ND Ill. 1974) (three-judge court); Seidenberg v. McSorleys' Old Ale House, Inc., 317 F. Supp. 593 (SDNY 1970); Commonwealth Alcoholic Beverage Control Bd. v. Burke, 481 S.W.2d 52 (Ky. 1972); cf. Sail'er Inn, Inc. v. Kirby, 5 Cal. 3d 1, 485 P.2d 529 (1971); Paterson Tavern & G. O. A. v. Hawthorne, 57 N. J. 180, 270 A.2d 628 (1970). Even when state officials have posited sociological or empirical justifications for these gender-based differentiations, the courts have struck down discriminations aimed at an entire class under the guise of alcohol regulation. In fact, social science studies that have uncovered quantifiable difference in drinking tendencies dividing along both racial and ethnic lines strongly suggest the need for application of the Equal Protection Clause in preventing discriminatory treatment that almost certainly would be perceived as invidious.[22] In sum, the principles embodied in the Equal *209 Protection Clause are not to be rendered inapplicable by statistically measured but loose-fitting generalities concerning the drinking tendencies of aggregate groups. We thus hold that the operation of the Twenty-first Amendment does not alter the application of equal protection standards that otherwise govern this case.
*210 We conclude that the gender-based differential contained in Okla. Stat., Tit. 37, § 245 (1976 Supp.) constitutes a denial of the equal protection of the laws to males aged 18-20[23] and reverse the judgment of the District Court.[24]
It is so ordered.
MR."
29606,Justice Blackmun,majority,False,Bellotti v. Baird,,1976,1.0,"In this litigation, a three-judge District Court for the District of Massachusetts enjoined the operation of certain provisions of a 1974 Massachusetts statute that govern the type of consent required before an abortion may *134 be performed on an unmarried woman under the age of 18. In so acting, the court denied by implication a motion by appellants that the court abstain from deciding the issue pending authoritative construction of the statute by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. We hold that the court should have abstained, and we vacate the judgment and remand the cases for certification of relevant issues of state law to the Supreme Judicial Court, and for abstention pending the decision of that tribunal.

I
On August 2, 1974, the General Court of Massachusetts (Legislature), over the Governor's veto, enacted legislation entitled ""An Act to protect unborn children and maternal health within present constitutional limits."" The Act, Mass. Acts and Resolves 1974, c. 706, § 1, amended Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., c. 112 (Registration of Certain Professions and Occupations), by adding §§ 12H through 12R.[1] Section 12P provides:
""(1) If the mother is less than eighteen years of age and has not married, the consent of both the mother and her parents is required. If one or both of the mother's parents refuse such consent, consent may be obtained by order of a judge of the superior *135 court for good cause shown, after such hearing as he deems necessary. Such a hearing will not require the appointment of a guardian for the mother.
""If one of the parents has died or has deserted his or her family, consent by the remaining parent is sufficient. If both parents have died or have deserted their family, consent of the mother's guardian or other person having duties similar to a guardian, or any person who had assumed the care and custody of the mother is sufficient.
""(2) The commissioner of public health shall prescribe a written form for such consent. Such form shall be signed by the proper person or persons and given to the physician performing the abortion who shall maintain it in his permanent files.
""Nothing in this section shall be construed as abolishing or limiting any common law rights of any other person or persons relative to consent to the performance of an abortion for purposes of any civil action or any injunctive relief under section twelve R.""
All nonemergency abortions are made subject to the provisions of § 12P by § 12N.[2] Violations of § 12N are *136 punishable under § 12Q by a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $2,000.[3] Section 12R provides that the Attorney General or any person whose consent is required may petition the superior court for an order enjoining the performance of any abortion.[4]

II
On October 30, 1974, one day prior to the effective date of the Act,[5] plaintiffs, who are appellees here, filed this action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, asserting jurisdiction under 28 U.S. C. §§ 1343 (3), 1331, and 2201, and 42 U.S. C. § 1983, and claiming that § 12P violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. They sought injunctive and declaratory relief, and requested the empaneling of a three-judge court pursuant to 28 U.S. C. §§ 2281 and 2284.
On October 31, the single District Judge issued an order temporarily restraining the enforcement of the parental-consent requirement of § 12P, and accepting the request for a three-judge court.[6] Record Doc. 2.
*137 The plaintiffs, and the classes they purported to represent, are:
1. William Baird, a citizen of New York.
2. Parents Aid Society, Inc., a Massachusetts not-for-profit corporation. Baird is president of the corporation and is director and chief counselor of the center it operates in Boston for the purpose of providing, inter alia, abortion and counseling services. Baird and Parents Aid claim to represent all abortion centers and their administrators in Massachusetts who, on a regular and recurring basis, deal with pregnant minors. App. 13, 43.
3. Mary Moes I, II, III, and IV, four minors under the age of 18, pregnant at the time of the filing of the suit, and residing in Massachusetts. Each alleged that she wished to terminate her pregnancy and did not wish to inform either of her parents.[7]Id., at 16-18, 19-22. The Moes claimed to represent all pregnant minors capable *138 of, and willing to give, informed consent to an abortion, but who decline to seek the consent of both parents, as required by § 12P. App. 13, 43.
4. Gerald Zupnick, M. D., a physician licensed to practice in Massachusetts. He is the medical director of the center operated by Parents Aid. He claims to represent all physicians in Massachusetts who, without parental consent, see minor patients seeking abortions. Ibid.
The defendants in the action, who are the appellants in No. 75-73 (and who are hereinafter referred to as the appellants), are the Attorney General of Massachusetts, and the District Attorneys of all the counties in the Commonwealth.
Appellant in No. 75-109 (hereinafter referred to as the intervenor-appellant) is Jane Hunerwadel, a resident and citizen of Massachusetts, and parent of an unmarried minor female of childbearing age. Hunerwadel was permitted by the District Court to intervene as a defendant on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated.[8] App. 24.
On November 13, appellants filed a ""Motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment,"" arguing, inter alia, that the District Court ""should abstain from deciding any issue in this case."" Id., at 23. In their memorandum to the court in support of that motion, appellants, in addition to other arguments, urged that § 12P, particularly in view of its judicial-review provision, ""was *139 susceptible of a construction by state courts that would avoid or modify any alleged federal constitutional question."" Record Doc. 5, p. 12. They cited Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496 (1941), and Lake Carriers' Assn. v. MacMullan, 406 U.S. 498, 510-511 (1972), for the proposition that where an unconstrued state statute is susceptible of a constitutional construction, a federal court should abstain from deciding a constitutional challenge to the statute until a definitive state construction has been obtained.
The District Court held hearings on the motion for a preliminary injunction; these were later merged into the trial on the merits. It received testimony from various experts and from parties to the case, including Mary Moe I. On April 28, 1975, the three-judge District Court, by a divided vote, handed down a decision holding § 12P unconstitutional and void. 393 F. Supp. 847. An order was entered declaring § 12P ""and such other portions of the chapter [112] insofar as they make specific reference thereto"" void, and enjoining the defendants from enforcing them. App. 45-46; Jurisdictional Statement in No. 75-73, pp. A-33, A-34.
The majority held, inter alia, that appellees Mary Moe I, Doctor Zupnick, and Parents Aid had standing to challenge the operation of the statute, individually and as representatives of their proposed classes, 393 F. Supp., at 850-852,[9] and that the intervenor-appellant had standing to represent the interests of parents of unmarried minor women of childbearing age, id., at 849-850. It found that ""a substantial number of females under the age of 18 are capable of forming a valid consent,"" and viewed the overall question as ""whether the state can be permitted *140 to restrain the free exercise of that consent, to the extent that it has endeavored to do so."" Id., at 855.
In regard to the meaning of § 12P, the majority made the following comments:
""1. The statute does not purport to require simply that parents be notified and given an opportunity to communicate with the minor, her chosen physician, or others. We mention this obvious fact because of the persistence of defendants and intervenor in arguing that the legislature could properly enact such a statute. Whether it could is not before us, and there is no reason for our considering it.
""2. The statute does not exclude those capable of forming an intelligent consent, but applies to all minors. The statute's provision calling for the minor's own consent recognizes that at least some minors can consent, but the minor's consent must be supplemented in every case, either by the consent of both parents, or by a court order.
.....
""4. The statute does not purport simply to provide a check on the validity of the minor's consent and the wisdom of her decision from the standpoint of her interests alone. Rather, it recognizes and provides rights in both parents, independent of, and hence potentially at variance with, her own personal interests."" 393 F. Supp., at 855.
""The dissent is seemingly of the opinion that a reviewing Superior Court Judge would consider only the interests of the minor. We find no room in the statute for so limited an interpretation."" Id., at 855 n. 10.
""The parents not only must be consulted, they are given a veto."" Id., at 856.
The majority observed that "" `neither the Fourteenth *141 Amendment nor the Bill of Rights is for adults alone,' In re Gault, 1967, 387 U.S. 1, 13,"" ibid., and, accordingly, held that the State cannot control a minor's abortion in the first trimester any more than it can control that of an adult. Re-emphasizing that ""the statute is cast not in terms of protecting the minor . . . but in recognizing independent rights of parents,"" the majority concluded that ""[t]he question comes, accordingly, do parents possess, apart from right to counsel and guide, competing rights of their own?"" Ibid.
The majority found that in the instant situation, unlike others, the parents' interests often are adverse to those of the minor and, specifically rejecting the contrary result in Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 392 F. Supp. 1362 (ED Mo. 1975), see ante, p. 52, concluded:
""But even if it should be found that parents may have rights of a Constitutional dimension vis-a-vis their child that are separate from the child's, we would find that in the present area the individual rights of the minor outweigh the rights of the parents, and must be protected."" 393 F. Supp., at 857.
The dissent argued that the parents of Mary Moe I, by not being informed of the action or joined as parties, ""have been deprived of their legal rights without due process of law,"" ibid., that the majority erred in refusing to appoint a guardian ad litem for Moe I, and that it erred in finding that she had the capacity to give a valid and informed consent to an abortion. The dissent further argued that parents possess constitutionally cognizable rights in guiding the upbringing of their children, and that the statute is a proper exercise of state power in protection of those parental rights. Id., at 857-865.
Most important, however, the dissent's view of the *142 statute differed markedly from the interpretation adopted by the majority. The dissent stated:
""I find, therefore, no conceivable constitutional objection to legislation providing in the case of a pregnant minor an additional condition designed to make certain that she receive parental or judicial guidance and counselling before having the abortion. The requirement of consent of both parents[[*]] ensures that both parents will provide counselling and guidance, each according to his or her best judgment. The statute expressly provides that the parents' refusal to consent is not final. The statute expressly gives the state courts the right to make a final determination. If the state courts find that the minor is mature enough to give an informed consent to the abortion and that she has been adequately informed about the nature of an abortion and its probable consequences to her, then we must assume that the courts will enter the necessary order permitting her to exercise her constitutional right to the abortion."" Id., at 864.
The indicated footnote reads:
""The majority speculate concerning possible interpretations of the `for good cause shown' language. There is also some doubt whether the statute requires consent of one or both parents. The construction of the statute is a matter of state law. If the majority believe the only constitutional infirmities arise from their interpretation of the statute, the majority should certify questions of state law to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts pursuant to Rule 3:21 of that court in order to receive a definitive interpretation of the statute."" Id., at 864 n. 15.
*143 Both appellants and intervenor-appellant appealed. We noted probable jurisdiction of each appeal and set the cases for oral argument with Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, ante, p. 52, and its companion cross-appeal. 423 U.S. 982 (1975).

III
Appellants and intervenor-appellant attack the District Court's majority decision on a number of grounds. They argue, inter alia, and each in their or her own way, that § 12P properly preserves the primacy of the family unit by reinforcing the role of parents in fundamental decisions affecting family members; that the District Court erred in failing to join Moe I's parents; that it abused its discretion by failing to appoint a guardian ad litem; and that it erred in finding the statute facially invalid when it was capable of a construction that would withstand constitutional analysis.
The interpretation placed on the statute by appellants in this Court is of some importance and merits attention, for they are the officials charged with enforcement of the statute.[10]
*144 Appellants assert, first, that under the statute parental consent may not be refused on the basis of concerns exclusively of the parent. Indeed, ""the `competing' parental right consists exclusively of the right to assess independently, for their minor child, what will serve that child's best interest. . . . [I]n operation, the parents' actual deliberation must range no further than would that of a pregnant adult making her own abortion decision."" Brief for Appellants 23. And the superior court's review will ensure that parental objection based upon other considerations will not operate to bar the minor's abortion. Id., at 22-23. See also Brief for Intervenor-Appellant 26.
Second, appellants argue that the last paragraph of § 12P[11] preserves the ""mature minor"" rule in Massachusetts, under which a child determined by a court to be capable of giving informed consent will be allowed to do so. Appellants argue that under this rule a pregnant minor could file a complaint in superior court seeking authorization for an abortion, and, ""[i]mportantly, such a complaint could be filed regardless of whether the parents had been consulted or had withheld their consent."" Brief for Appellants 37-38 (emphasis in original); Tr. of Oral Arg. 17. Appellants and the intervenor-appellant assert that the procedure employed would be structured *145 so as to be speedy and nonburdensome, and would ensure anonymity. Brief for Appellants 38 n. 30; Brief for Intervenor-Appellant 26; Tr. of Oral Arg. 24-26.
Finally, appellants argue that under § 12P, a judge of the superior court may permit an abortion without parental consent for a minor incapable of rendering informed consent, provided that there is ""good cause shown."" Brief for Appellants 38. ""Good cause"" includes a showing that the abortion is in the minor's best interests. Id., at 39.
The picture thus painted by the respective appellants is of a statute that prefers parental consultation and consent, but that permits a mature minor capable of giving informed consent to obtain, without undue burden, an order permitting the abortion without parental consultation, and, further, permits even a minor incapable of giving informed consent to obtain an order without parental consultation where there is a showing that the abortion would be in her best interests. The statute, as thus read, would be fundamentally different from a statute that creates a ""parental veto.""[12]
Appellees, however, on their part, take an entirely different view of the statute. They argue that the statute *146 creates a right to a parental veto,[13] that it creates an irrebuttable presumption that a minor is incapable of informed consent,[14] and that the statute does not permit abortion without parental consent in the case of a mature minor or, in the case of a minor incapable of giving consent, where the parents are irrationally opposed to abortion.[15]
Appellees specifically object to abstention. Their objection is based upon their opinion that ""the statute gives to parents of minors an unbridled veto,"" Brief for Appellees 49, and that once that veto is exercised, the minor has the burden of proving to the superior court judge that ""good cause"" exists. Ibid. They view the ""good cause"" hearing as forcing the judge to choose ""between the privacy rights of the young woman and the rights of the parents as established by the statute."" Ibid. Assuming that ""good cause"" has a broader meaning, appellees argue that the hearing itself makes the statute unconstitutional, because of the burden it imposes and the delay it entails. Ibid.

IV
In deciding this case, we need go no further than the claim that the District Court should have abstained pending construction of the statute by the Massachusetts courts. As we have held on numerous occasions, abstention *147 is appropriate where an unconstrued state statute is susceptible of a construction by the state judiciary ""which might avoid in whole or in part the necessity for federal constitutional adjudication, or at least materially change the nature of the problem."" Harrison v. NAACP, 360 U.S. 167, 177 (1959). See also Colorado River Cons. Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 813-814 (1976); Carey v. Sugar, 425 U.S. 73, 78-79 (1976); Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U.S. 51, 54-55 (1973); Lake Carriers' Assn. v. MacMullan, 406 U. S., at 510-511; Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241, 249 (1967); Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496 (1941).
We do not accept appellees' assertion that the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts inevitably will interpret the statute so as to create a ""parental veto,"" require the superior court to act other than in the best interests of the minor, or impose undue burdens upon a minor capable of giving an informed consent.
In Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, we today struck down a statute that created a parental veto. Ante, at 72-75. At the same time, however, we held that a requirement of written consent on the part of a pregnant adult is not unconstitutional unless it unduly burdens the right to seek an abortion. In this case, we are concerned with a statute directed toward minors, as to whom there are unquestionably greater risks of inability to give an informed consent. Without holding that a requirement of a court hearing would not unduly burden the rights of a mature adult, cf. Doe v. Rampton, 366 F. Supp. 189 (Utah 1973), we think it clear that in the instant litigation adoption of appellants' interpretation would ""at least materially change the nature of the problem"" that appellants claim is presented. Harrison v. NAACP, 360 U. S., at 177.
Whether the Supreme Judicial Court will so interpret *148 the statute, or whether it will interpret the statute to require consideration of factors not mentioned above, impose burdens more serious than those suggested, or create some unanticipated interference with the doctor-patient relationship, we cannot now determine.[16] Nor need we determine what factors are impermissible or at what point review of consent and good cause in the case of a minor becomes unduly burdensome. It is sufficient that the statute is susceptible of the interpretation offered by appellants, and we so find, and that such an interpretation would avoid or substantially modify the federal constitutional challenge to the statute, as it clearly would. Indeed, in the absence of an authoritative construction, it is impossible to define precisely the constitutional question presented.
Appellees also raise, however, a claim of impermissible distinction between the consent procedures applicable to minors in the area of abortion, and the consent required in regard to other medical procedures. This issue has come to the fore through the advent of a Massachusetts statute, enacted subsequent to the decision of the District Court, dealing with consent by minors to medical procedures other than abortion and sterilization.[17] As *149 we hold today in Planned Parenthood, however, not all distinction between abortion and other procedures is forbidden. Ante, at 80-81. The constitutionality of such *150 distinction will depend upon its degree and the justification for it. The constitutional issue cannot now be defined, however, for the degree of distinction between the consent procedure for abortions and the consent procedures for other medical procedures cannot be established until the nature of the consent required for abortions is established. In these circumstances, the federal court should stay its hand to the same extent as in a challenge directly to the burdens created by the statute.
Finally, we note that the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has adopted a Rule of Court under which an issue of interpretation of Massachusetts law may be certified directly to that court for prompt resolution. Mass. Rules of Court, Sup. Jud. Ct. Rule 3:21 (1976). This Court often has remarked that the equitable practice of abstention is limited by considerations of "" `the delay and expense to which application of the abstention doctrine inevitably gives rise.' "" Lake Carriers' Assn. v. MacMullan, 406 U. S., at 509, quoting England v. Medical Examiners, 375 U.S. 411, 418 (1964). See Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U. S., at 54. As we have also noted, however, the availability of an adequate certification procedure[18] ""does, of course, in the long run save time, *151 energy, and resources and helps build a cooperative judicial federalism."" Lehman Brothers v. Schein, 416 U.S. 386, 391 (1974). This Court has utilized certification procedures in the past, as have courts of appeals. Ibid. and cases cited therein at 390 nn. 5 and 6.
The importance of speed in resolution of the instant litigation is manifest. Each day the statute is in effect, irretrievable events, with substantial personal consequences, occur. Although we do not mean to intimate that abstention would be improper in this case were certification not possible, the availability of certification greatly simplifies the analysis. Further, in light of our disapproval of a ""parental veto"" today in Planned Parenthood, we must assume that the lower Massachusetts courts, if called upon to enforce the statute pending interpretation by the Supreme Judicial Court, will not impose this most serious barrier. Insofar as the issue thus ceases to become one of total denial of access and becomes one rather of relative burden, the cost of abstention is reduced and the desirability of that equitable remedy accordingly increased.

V
We therefore hold that the District Court should have certified to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts appropriate questions concerning the meaning of § 12P and the procedure it imposes. In regard to the claim of impermissible discrimination due to the 1975 statute, a claim not raised in the District Court but subject to inquiry through an amended complaint, or perhaps by other means, we believe that it would not be inappropriate for the District Court, when any procedural requirement *152 has been complied with, also to certify a question concerning the meaning of the new statute, and the extent to which its procedures differ from the procedures that must be followed under § 12P.
The judgment of the District Court is vacated, and the cases are remanded to that court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
"
6365,Justice Stewart,majority,False,Dothard v. Rawlinson,,1977,1.0,"Appellee Dianne Rawlinson sought employment with the Alabama Board of Corrections as a prison guard, called in Alabama a ""correctional counselor."" After her application was rejected, she brought this class suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U.S. C. § 2000e et seq. (1970 ed. and Supp. V), and under 42 U.S. C. § 1983, alleging that she had been denied employment because of her sex in violation of federal law. A three-judge Federal District Court for the Middle District of Alabama decided in her favor. Mieth v. Dothard, 418 F. Supp. 1169. We noted probable jurisdiction of this appeal from the District Court's judgment. 429 U.S. 976.[1]

I
At the time she applied for a position as correctional counselor trainee, Rawlinson was a 22-year-old college graduate whose major course of study had been correctional psychology. She was refused employment because she failed to meet the minimum 120-pound weight requirement established *324 by an Alabama statute. The statute also establishes a height minimum of 5 feet 2 inches.[2]
After her application was rejected because of her weight, Rawlinson filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and ultimately received a right-to-sue letter.[3] She then filed a complaint in the District Court on behalf of herself and other similarly situated women, challenging the statutory height and weight minima as violative of Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.[4] A three-judge court was convened.[5] While the suit was pending, the Alabama Board of Corrections *325 adopted Administrative Regulation 204, establishing gender criteria for assigning correctional counselors to maximum-security institutions for ""contact positions,"" that is, positions requiring continual close physical proximity to inmates of the institution.[6] Rawlinson amended her class-action *326 complaint by adding a challenge to Regulation 204 as also violative of Title VII and the Fourteenth Amendment.
Like most correctional facilities in the United States,[7] Alabama's prisons are segregated on the basis of sex. Currently the Alabama Board of Corrections operates four major all-male penitentiariesHolman Prison, Kilby Corrections Facility, G. K. Fountain Correction Center, and Draper Correctional Center. The Board also operates the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women, the Frank Lee Youth Center, the Number Four Honor Camp, the State Cattle Ranch, and nine Work Release Centers, one of which is for women. The Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women and the four male penitentiaries are maximum-security institutions. Their inmate living quarters are for the most part large dormitories, with communal showers and toilets that are open to the dormitories and hallways. The Draper and Fountain penitentiaries carry on extensive farming operations, making necessary a large number of strip searches for contraband when prisoners re-enter the prison buildings.
A correctional counselor's primary duty within these institutions is to maintain security and control of the inmates *327 by continually supervising and observing their activities.[8] To be eligible for consideration as a correctional counselor, an applicant must possess a valid Alabama driver's license, have a high school education or its equivalent, be free from physical defects, be between the ages of 20½ years and 45 years at the time of appointment, and fall between the minimum height and weight requirements of 5 feet 2 inches, and 120 pounds, and the maximum of 6 feet 10 inches, and 300 pounds. Appointment is by merit, with a grade assigned each applicant based on experience and education. No written examination is given.
At the time this litigation was in the District Court, the Board of Corrections employed a total of 435 people in various correctional counselor positions, 56 of whom were women. Of those 56 women, 21 were employed at the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women, 13 were employed in noncontact positions at the four male maximum-security institutions, and the remaining 22 were employed at the other institutions operated by the Alabama Board of Corrections. Because most of Alabama's prisoners are held at the four maximum-security male penitentiaries, 336 of the 435 correctional counselor jobs were in those institutions, a majority of them concededly in the ""contact"" classification.[9] Thus, even though meeting the statutory height and weight requirements, women applicants could under Regulation 204 compete *328 equally with men for only about 25% of the correctional counselor jobs available in the Alabama prison system.

II
In enacting Title VII, Congress required ""the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible classification."" Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431. The District Court found that the minimum statutory height and weight requirements that applicants for employment as correctional counselors must meet constitute the sort of arbitrary barrier to equal employment opportunity that Title VII forbids.[10] The appellants assert that the District Court erred both in finding that the height and weight standards discriminate against women, and in its refusal to find that, even if they do, these standards are justified as ""job related.""

A
The gist of the claim that the statutory height and weight requirements discriminate against women does not involve an assertion of purposeful discriminatory motive.[11] It is asserted, *329 rather, that these facially neutral qualification standards work in fact disproportionately to exclude women from eligibility for employment by the Alabama Board of Corrections. We dealt in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., supra, and Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, with similar allegations that facially neutral employment standards disproportionately excluded Negroes from employment, and those cases guide our approach here.
Those cases make clear that to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, a plaintiff need only show that the facially neutral standards in question select applicants for hire in a significantly discriminatory pattern. Once it is thus shown that the employment standards are discriminatory in effect, the employer must meet ""the burden of showing that any given requirement [has] . . . a manifest relationship to the employment in question."" Griggs v. Duke Power Co., supra, at 432. If the employer proves that the challenged requirements are job related, the plaintiff may then show that other selection devices without a similar discriminatory effect would also ""serve the employer's legitimate interest in `efficient and trustworthy workmanship.'"" Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, supra, at 425, quoting McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 801.
Although women 14 years of age or older compose 52.75% of the Alabama population and 36.89% of its total labor force, they hold only 12.9% of its correctional counselor positions. In considering the effect of the minimum height and weight standards on this disparity in rate of hiring between the sexes, the District Court found that the 5'2""-requirement would operate to exclude 33.29% of the women in the United States between the ages of 18-79, while excluding only 1.28% of men between the same ages. The 120-pound weight restriction would exclude 22.29% of the women and 2.35% of the men in this age group. When the height and weight restrictions are combined, Alabama's statutory standards would exclude 41.13% of the female population *330 while excluding less than 1% of the male population.[12] Accordingly, the District Court found that Rawlinson had made out a prima facie case of unlawful sex discrimination.
The appellants argue that a showing of disproportionate impact on women based on generalized national statistics should not suffice to establish a prima facie case. They point in particular to Rawlinson's failure to adduce comparative statistics concerning actual applicants for correctional counselor positions in Alabama. There is no requirement, however, that a statistical showing of disproportionate impact must always be based on analysis of the characteristics of actual applicants. See Griggs v. Duke Power Co., supra, at 430. The application process itself might not adequately reflect the actual potential applicant pool, since otherwise qualified people might be discouraged from applying because of a self-recognized inability to meet the very standards challenged as being discriminatory. See Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 365-367. A potential applicant could easily determine her height and weight and conclude that to make an application would be futile. Moreover, reliance on general population demographic data was not misplaced where there was no reason to suppose that physical height and weight characteristics of Alabama men and women differ markedly from those of the national population.
*331 For these reasons, we cannot say that the District Court was wrong in holding that the statutory height and weight standards had a discriminatory impact on women applicants. The plaintiffs in a case such as this are not required to exhaust every possible source of evidence, if the evidence actually presented on its face conspicuously demonstrates a job requirement's grossly discriminatory impact. If the employer discerns fallacies or deficiencies in the data offered by the plaintiff, he is free to adduce countervailing evidence of his own. In this case no such effort was made.[13]

B
We turn, therefore, to the appellants' argument that they have rebutted the prima facie case of discrimination by showing that the height and weight requirements are job related. These requirements, they say, have a relationship to strength, a sufficient but unspecified amount of which is essential to effective job performance as a correctional counselor. In the District Court, however, the appellants produced no evidence correlating the height and weight requirements with the requisite amount of strength thought essential to good job performance. Indeed, they failed to offer evidence of any kind in specific justification of the statutory standards.[14]
*332 If the job-related quality that the appellants identify is bona fide, their purpose could be achieved by adopting and validating a test for applicants that measures strength directly.[15] Such a test, fairly administered, would fully satisfy the standards of Title VII because it would be one that ""measure[s] the person for the job and not the person in the abstract."" Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S., at 436. But nothing in the present record even approaches such a measurement.
For the reasons we have discussed, the District Court was not in error in holding that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, prohibits application of the statutory height and weight requirements to Rawlinson and the class she represents.

III
Unlike the statutory height and weight requirements, Regulation 204 explicitly discriminates against women on the basis of their sex.[16] In defense of this overt discrimination, *333 the appellants rely on § 703 (e) of Title VII, 42 U.S. C. § 2000e-2 (e), which permits sex-based discrimination ""in those certain instances where . . . sex . . . is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise.""
The District Court rejected the bona-fide-occupational-qualification (bfoq) defense, relying on the virtually uniform view of the federal courts that § 703 (e) provides only the narrowest of exceptions to the general rule requiring equality of employment opportunities. This view has been variously formulated. In Diaz v. Pan American World Airways, 442 F.2d 385, 388, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that ""discrimination based on sex is valid only when the essence of the business operation would be undermined by not hiring members of one sex exclusively."" (Emphasis in original.) In an earlier case, Weeks v. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 408 F.2d 228, 235, the same court said that an employer could rely on the bfoq exception only by proving ""that he had reasonable cause to believe, that is, a factual basis for believing, that all or substantially all women would be unable to perform safely and efficiently the duties of the job involved."" See also Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U.S. 542. But whatever the verbal formulation, the federal courts have agreed that it is impermissible under Title VII to refuse to hire an individual woman or man on the basis of stereotyped characterizations of the sexes,[17] and the District *334 Court in the present case held in effect that Regulation 204 is based on just such stereotypical assumptions.
We are persuadedby the restrictive language of § 703 (e), the relevant legislative history,[18] and the consistent interpretation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission[19] that the bfoq exception was in fact meant to be an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex.[20] In the particular factual circumstances of this case, however, we conclude that the District Court erred in rejecting the State's contention that Regulation 204 falls within the narrow ambit of the bfoq exception.
The environment in Alabama's penitentiaries is a peculiarly inhospitable one for human beings of whatever sex. Indeed, a Federal District Court has held that the conditions of confinement in the prisons of the State, characterized by ""rampant violence"" and a ""jungle atmosphere,"" are constitutionally intolerable. Pugh v. Locke, 406 F. Supp. 318, 325 (MD Ala.). The record in the present case shows that *335 because of inadequate staff and facilities, no attempt is made in the four maximum-security male penitentiaries to classify or segregate inmates according to their offense or level of dangerousnessa procedure that, according to expert testimony, is essential to effective penological administration. Consequently, the estimated 20% of the male prisoners who are sex offenders are scattered throughout the penitentiaries' dormitory facilities.
In this environment of violence and disorganization, it would be an oversimplification to characterize Regulation 204 as an exercise in ""romantic paternalism."" Cf. Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 684. In the usual case, the argument that a particular job is too dangerous for women may appropriately be met by the rejoinder that it is the purpose of Title VII to allow the individual woman to make that choice for herself.[21] More is at stake in this case, however, than an individual woman's decision to weigh and accept the risks of employment in a ""contact"" position in a maximum-security male prison.
The essence of a correctional counselor's job is to maintain prison security. A woman's relative ability to maintain order in a male, maximum-security, unclassified penitentiary of the type Alabama now runs could be directly reduced by her womanhood. There is a basis in fact for expecting that sex offenders who have criminally assaulted women in the past would be moved to do so again if access to women were established within the prison. There would also be a real risk that other inmates, deprived of a normal heterosexual environment, would assault women guards because they were women.[22] In a prison system where violence is the order *336 of the day, where inmate access to guards is facilitated by dormitory living arrangements, where every institution is understaffed, and where a substantial portion of the inmate population is composed of sex offenders mixed at random with other prisoners, there are few visible deterrents to inmate assaults on women custodians.
Appellee Rawlinson's own expert testified that dormitory housing for aggressive inmates poses a greater security problem than single-cell lockups, and further testified that it would be unwise to use women as guards in a prison where even 10% of the inmates had been convicted of sex crimes and were not segregated from the other prisoners.[23] The likelihood that inmates would assault a woman because she was a woman would pose a real threat not only to the victim of the assault but also to the basic control of the penitentiary and protection of its inmates and the other security personnel. The employee's very womanhood would thus directly undermine her capacity to provide the security that is the essence of a correctional counselor's responsibility.
There was substantial testimony from experts on both sides of this litigation that the use of women as guards in ""contact"" positions under the existing conditions in Alabama maximum-security male penitentiaries would pose a substantial security problem, directly linked to the sex of the prison guard. On the basis of that evidence, we conclude that the District Court was in error in ruling that being male is not a bona fide occupational qualification for the job of *337 correctional counselor in a ""contact"" position in an Alabama male maximum-security penitentiary.[24]
The judgment is accordingly affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN join, concurring in the result and concurring in part.
I agree with, and join, Parts I and III of the Court's opinion in this case and with its judgment. While I also agree with the Court's conclusion in Part II of its opinion, holding that the District Court was ""not in error"" in holding the statutory height and weight requirements in this case to be invalidated by Title VII, ante, at 332, the issues with which that Part deals are bound to arise so frequently that I feel obliged to separately state the reasons for my agreement with its result. I view affirmance of the District Court in this respect as essentially dictated by the peculiarly limited factual and legal justifications offered below by appellants on behalf of the statutory requirements. For that reason, I do not believeand do not read the Court's opinion as holdingthat all or even many of the height and weight requirements imposed by States on applicants for a multitude of law enforcement agency jobs are pretermitted by today's decision.
I agree that the statistics relied upon in this case are sufficient, absent rebuttal, to sustain a finding of a prima *338 facie violation of § 703 (a) (2), in that they reveal a significant discrepancy between the numbers of men, as opposed to women, who are automatically disqualified by reason of the height and weight requirements. The fact that these statistics are national figures of height and weight, as opposed to statewide or pool-of-labor-force statistics, does not seem to me to require us to hold that the District Court erred as a matter of law in admitting them into evidence. See Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 108, 124-125 (1974); cf. Zenith Corp. v. Hazeltine, 395 U.S. 100, 123-125 (1969). It is for the District Court, in the first instance, to detormine whether these statistics appear sufficiently probative of the ultimate fact in issuewhether a given job qualification requirement has a disparate impact on some group protected by Title VII. Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States, ante, at 312-313; see Hamling v. United States, supra, at 108, 124-125; Mayor v. Educational Equality League, 415 U.S. 605, 621 n. 20 (1974); see also McAllister v. United States, 348 U.S. 19 (1954); United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 338 U.S. 338, 340-342 (1949). In making this determination, such statistics are to be considered in light of all other relevant facts and circumstances. Cf. Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 340 (1977). The statistics relied on here do not suffer from the obvious lack of relevancy of the statistics relied on by the District Court in Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States, ante, at 308. A reviewing court cannot say as a matter of law that they are irrelevant to the contested issue or so lacking in reliability as to be inadmissible.
If the defendants in a Title VII suit believe there to be any reason to discredit plaintiffs' statistics that does not appear on their face, the opportunity to challenge them is available to the defendants just as in any other lawsuit. They may endeavor to impeach the reliability of the statistical evidence, they may offer rebutting evidence, or they may disparage in arguments or in briefs the probative weight which *339 the plaintiffs' evidence should be accorded. Since I agree with the Court that appellants made virtually no such effort, ante, at 331, I also agree with it that the District Court cannot be said to have erred as a matter of law in finding that a prima facie case had been made out in the instant case.
While the District Court's conclusion is by no means required by the proffered evidence, I am unable to conclude that the District Court's finding in that respect was clearly erroneous. In other cases there could be different evidence which could lead a district court to conclude that height and weight are in fact an accurate enough predictor of strength to justify, under all the circumstances, such minima. Should the height and weight requirements be found to advance the job-related qualification of strength sufficiently to rebut the prima facie case, then, under our cases, the burden would shift back to appellee Rawlinson to demonstrate that other tests, without such disparate effect, would also meet that concern. Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 425 (1975). But, here, the District Court permissibly concluded that appellants had not shown enough of a nexus even to rebut the inference.
Appellants, in order to rebut the prima facie case under the statute, had the burden placed on them to advance job-related reasons for the qualification. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973). This burden could be shouldered by offering evidence or by making legal arguments not dependent on any new evidence. The District Court was confronted, however, with only one suggested job-related reason for the qualificationthat of strength. Appellants argued only the job-relatedness of actual physical strength; they did not urge that an equally job-related qualification for prison guards is the appearance of strength. As the Court notes, the primary job of correctional counselor in Alabama prisons ""is to maintain security and control of the inmates. . .,"" ante, at 326, a function that I at least would *340 imagine is aided by the psychological impact on prisoners of the presence of tall and heavy guards. If the appearance of strength had been urged upon the District Court here as a reason for the height and weight minima, I think that the District Court would surely have been entitled to reach a different result than it did. For, even if not perfectly correlated, I would think that Title VII would not preclude a State from saying that anyone under 5'2"" or 120 pounds, no matter how strong in fact, does not have a sufficient appearance of strength to be a prison guard.
But once the burden has been placed on the defendant, it is then up to the defendant to articulate the asserted job-related reasons underlying the use of the minima. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, supra, at 802; Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971); Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, supra, at 425. Because of this burden, a reviewing court is not ordinarily justified in relying on arguments in favor of a job qualification that were not first presented to the trial court. Cf. United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365, 374 n. 5 (1967); Thomas v. Taylor, 224 U.S. 73, 84 (1912); Bell v. Bruen, 1 How. 169, 187 (1843). As appellants did not even present the ""appearance of strength"" contention to the District Court as an asserted job-related reason for the qualification requirements, I agree that their burden was not met. The District Court's holding thus did not deal with the question of whether such an assertion could or did rebut appellee Rawlinson's prima facie case.
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
I agree entirely with the Court's analysis of Alabama's height and weight requirements for prison guards, and with its finding that these restrictions discriminate on the basis of sex in violation of Title VII. Accordingly, I join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion. I also agree with much of the Court's general discussion in Part III of the bona-fide-occupational-qualification *341 exception contained in § 703 (e) of Title VII.[1] The Court is unquestionably correct when it holds ""that the bfoq exception was in fact meant to be an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex."" Ante, at 334. See Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U.S. 542, 544 (1971) (MARSHALL, J., concurring). I must, however, respectfully disagree with the Court's application of the bfoq exception in this case.
The Court properly rejects two proffered justifications for denying women jobs as prison guards. It is simply irrelevant here that a guard's occupation is dangerous and that some women might be unable to protect themselves adequately. Those themes permeate the testimony of the state officials below, but as the Court holds, ""the argument that a particular job is too dangerous for women"" is refuted by the ""purpose of Title VII to allow the individual woman to make that choice for herself."" Ante, at 335. Some women, like some men, undoubtedly are not qualified and do not wish to serve as prison guards, but that does not justify the exclusion of all women from this employment opportunity. Thus, ""[i]n the usual case,"" ibid., the Court's interpretation of the bfoq exception would mandate hiring qualified women for guard jobs in maximum-security institutions. The highly successful experiences of other States allowing such job opportunities, see briefs for the States of California and Washington as amici curiae, confirm that absolute disqualification of women is not, in the words of Title VII, ""reasonably necessary to the normal operation"" of a maximum-security prison.
What would otherwise be considered unlawful discrimination against women is justified by the Court, however, on the *342 basis of the ""barbaric and inhumane"" conditions in Alabama prisons, conditions so bad that state officials have conceded that they violate the Constitution. See Pugh v. Locke, 406 F. Supp. 318, 329, 331 (MD Ala. 1976). To me, this analysis sounds distressingly like saying two wrongs make a right. It is refuted by the plain words of § 703 (e). The statute requires that a bfoq be ""reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise."" But no governmental ""business"" may operate ""normally"" in violation of the Constitution. Every action of government is constrained by constitutional limitations. While those limits may be violated more frequently than we would wish, no one disputes that the ""normal operation"" of all government functions takes place within them. A prison system operating in blatant violation of the Eighth Amendment is an exception that should be remedied with all possible speed, as Judge Johnson's comprehensive order in Pugh v. Locke, supra, is designed to do. In the meantime, the existence of such violations should not be legitimatized by calling them ""normal."" Nor should the Court accept them as justifying conduct that would otherwise violate a statute intended to remedy age-old discrimination.
The Court's error in statutory construction is less objectionable, however, than the attitude it displays toward women. Though the Court recognizes that possible harm to women guards is an unacceptable reason for disqualifying women, it relies instead on an equally speculative threat to prison discipline supposedly generated by the sexuality of female guards. There is simply no evidence in the record to show that women guards would create any danger to security in Alabama prisons significantly greater than that which already exists. All of the dangerswith one exception discussed beloware inherent in a prison setting, whatever the gender of the guards.
*343 The Court first sees women guards as a threat to security because ""there are few visible deterrents to inmate assaults on women custodians."" Ante, at 336. In fact, any prison guard is constantly subject to the threat of attack by inmates, and ""invisible"" deterrents are the guard's only real protection. No prison guard relies primarily on his or her ability to ward off an inmate attack to maintain order. Guards are typically unarmed and sheer numbers of inmates could overcome the normal complement. Rather, like all other law enforcement officers, prison guards must rely primarily on the moral authority of their office and the threat of future punishment for miscreants. As one expert testified below, common sense, fairness, and mental and emotional stability are the qualities a guard needs to cope with the dangers of the job. App. 81. Well qualified and properly trained women, no less than men, have these psychological weapons at their disposal.
The particular severity of discipline problems in the Alabama maximum-security prisons is also no justification for the discrimination sanctioned by the Court. The District Court found in Pugh v. Locke, supra, that guards ""must spend all their time attempting to maintain control or to protect themselves."" 406 F. Supp., at 325. If male guards face an impossible situation, it is difficult to see how women could make the problem worse, unless one relies on precisely the type of generalized bias against women that the Court agrees Title VII was intended to outlaw. For example, much of the testimony of appellants' witnesses ignores individual differences among members of each sex and reads like ""ancient canards about the proper role of women."" Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U. S., at 545. The witnesses claimed that women guards are not strict disciplinarians; that they are physically less capable of protecting themselves and subduing unruly inmates; that inmates take advantage of them as they did their mothers, while male guards are strong father figures *344 who easily maintain discipline, and so on.[2] Yet the record shows that the presence of women guards has not led to a single incident amounting to a serious breach of security in any Alabama institution.[3] And, in any event, ""[g]uards rarely enter the cell blocks and dormitories,"" Pugh v. Locke, 406 F. Supp., at 325, where the danger of inmate attacks is the greatest.
*345 It appears that the real disqualifying factor in the Court's view is ""[t]he employee's very womanhood."" Ante, at 336. The Court refers to the large number of sex offenders in Alabama prisons, and to ""[t]he likelihood that inmates would assault a woman because she was a woman."" Ibid. In short, the fundamental justification for the decision is that women as guards will generate sexual assaults. With all respect, this rationale regrettably perpetuates one of the most insidious of the old myths about womenthat women, wittingly or not, are seductive sexual objects. The effect of the decision, made I am sure with the best of intentions, is to punish women because their very presence might provoke sexual assaults. It is women who are made to pay the price in lost job opportunities for the threat of depraved conduct by prison inmates. Once again, ""[t]he pedestal upon which women have been placed has . . ., upon closer inspection, been revealed as a cage."" Sail'er Inn, Inc. v. Kirby, 5 Cal. 3d 1, 20, 485 P.2d 529, 541 (1971). It is particularly ironic that the cage is erected here in response to feared misbehavior by imprisoned criminals.[4]
The Court points to no evidence in the record to support the asserted ""likelihood that inmates would assault a woman because she was a woman."" Ante, at 336. Perhaps the Court relies upon common sense, or ""innate recognition,"" Brief for Appellants 51. But the danger in this emotionally laden context is that common sense will be used to mask the ""`romantic paternalism'"" and persisting discriminatory attitudes *346 that the Court properly eschews. Ante, at 335. To me, the only matter of innate recognition is that the incidence of sexually motivated attacks on guards will be minute compared to the ""likelihood that inmates will assault"" a guard because he or she is a guard.
The proper response to inevitable attacks on both female and male guards is not to limit the employment opportunities of law-abiding women who wish to contribute to their community, but to take swift and sure punitive action against the inmate offenders. Presumably, one of the goals of the Alabama prison system is the eradication of inmates' antisocial behavior patterns so that prisoners will be able to live one day in free society. Sex offenders can begin this process by learning to relate to women guards in a socially acceptable manner. To deprive women of job opportunities because of the threatened behavior of convicted criminals is to turn our social priorities upside down.[5]
Although I do not countenance the sex discrimination *347 condoned by the majority, it is fortunate that the Court's decision is carefully limited to the facts before it. I trust the lower courts will recognize that the decision was impelled by the shockingly inhuman conditions in Alabama prisons, and thus that the ""extremely narrow [bfoq] exception"" recognized here, ante, at 334, will not be allowed ""to swallow the rule"" against sex discrimination. See Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U. S., at 545. Expansion of today's decision beyond its narrow factual basis would erect a serious roadblock to economic equality for women.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, concurring in No. 76-255 and dissenting in No. 76-422.
I join the Court's opinion in Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States, No. 76-255, ante, p. 299, but with reservations with respect to the relative neglect of applicant pool data in finding a prima facie case of employment discrimination and heavy reliance on the disparity between the areawide percentage of black public school teachers and the percentage of blacks on Hazelwood's teaching staff. Since the issue is whether Hazelwood discriminated against blacks in hiring after Title VII became applicable to it in 1972, perhaps the Government should have looked initially to Hazelwood's hiring practices in the 1972-1973 and 1973-1974 academic years with respect to the available applicant pool, rather than to history and to comparative work-force statistics from other school districts. Indeed, there is evidence in the record suggesting that Hazelwood, with a black enrollment of only 2%, hired a higher percentage of black applicants than of white applicants for these two years. The Court's opinion, of course, permits Hazelwood to introduce applicant pool data on remand in order to rebut the prima facie case of a discriminatory pattern or practice. This may be the only fair and realistic allocation of the evidence burden, but arguably the United States should have been required to adduce evidence as to the applicant pool *348 before it was entitled to its prima facie presumption. At least it might have been required to present some defensible ground for believing that the racial composition of Hazelwood's applicant pool was roughly the same as that for the school districts in the general area, before relying on comparative work-force data to establish its prima facie case.
In Dothard v. Rawlinson, No. 76-422, I have more trouble agreeing that a prima facie case of sex discrimination was made out by statistics showing that the Alabama height and weight requirements would exclude a larger percentage of women in the United States than of men. As in Hazelwood, the issue is whether there was discrimination in dealing with actual or potential applicants; but in Hazelwood there was at least a colorable argument that the racial composition of the areawide teacher work force was a reasonable proxy for the composition of the relevant applicant pool and hence that a large divergence between the percentage of blacks on the teaching staff and the percentage in the teacher work force raised a fair inference of racial discrimination in dealing with the applicant pool. In Dothard, however, I am unwilling to believe that the percentage of women applying or interested in applying for jobs as prison guards in Alabama approximates the percentage of women either in the national or state population. A plaintiff could, of course, show that the composition of the applicant pool was distorted by the exclusion of nonapplicants who did not apply because of the allegedly discriminatory job requirement. But no such showing was made or even attempted here; and although I do not know what the actual fact is, I am not now convinced that a large percentage of the actual women applicants, or of those who are seriously interested in applying, for prison guard positions would fail to satisfy the height and weight requirements. Without a more satisfactory record on this issue, I cannot conclude that appellee Rawlinson has either made out a prima facie case for the invalidity of the restrictions or otherwise proved that she was *349 improperly denied employment as a prison guard. There being no showing of discrimination, I do not reach the question of justification; nor, since she does not meet the threshold requirements for becoming a prison guard, need I deal with the gender-based requirements for contact positions. I dissent from the Court's judgment in Dothard insofar as it affirms the judgment of the District Court.
"
1607,Justice Rehnquist,majority,False,Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty,,1977,2.0,"Petitioner requires pregnant employees to take a formal leave of absence. The employee does not receive sick pay while on pregnancy leave. She also loses all accumulated job seniority; as a result, while petitioner attempts to provide the employee with temporary work upon her return, she will be employed in a permanent job position only if no employee presently working for petitioner also applies for the position. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee held that these policies violate Title VII of the Civil *138 Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U.S. C. § 2000e et seq. (1970 ed. and Supp. V). 384 F. Supp. 765 (1974). The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. 522 F.2d 850 (1975). We granted certiorari, 429 U.S. 1071, to decide, in light of our opinion last Term in General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125 (1976), whether the lower courts properly applied Title VII to petitioner's policies respecting pregnancy.
Two separate policies are at issue in this case. The first is petitioner's practice of giving sick pay to employees disabled by reason of nonoccupational sickness or injury but not to those disabled by pregnancy. The second is petitioner's practice of denying accumulated seniority to female employees returning to work following disability caused by childbirth.[1] We shall discuss them in reverse order.

I
Petitioner requires an employee who is about to give birth to take a pregnancy leave of indeterminate length. Such an employee does not accumulate seniority while absent, but *139 instead actually loses any job seniority accrued before the leave commenced. Petitioner will not hold the employee's job open for her awaiting her return from pregnancy leave. An employee who wishes to return to work from such leave will be placed in any open position for which she is qualified and for which no individual currently employed is bidding; before such time as a permanent position becomes available, the company attempts to find temporary work for the employee. If and when the employee acquires a permanent position, she regains previously accumulated seniority for purposes of pension, vacation, and the like, but does not regain it for the purpose of bidding on future job openings.
Respondent began work for petitioner on March 24, 1969, as a clerk in its Customer Accounting Department. She commenced maternity leave on December 29, 1972, and gave birth to her child on January 23, 1973. Seven weeks later she sought re-employment with petitioner. The position that she had previously held had been eliminated as a result of bona fide cutbacks in her department. Temporary employment was found for her at a lower salary than she had earned prior to taking leave. While holding this temporary employment, respondent unsuccessfully applied for three permanent positions with petitioner. Each position was awarded to another employee who had begun to work for petitioner before respondent had returned from leave; if respondent had been credited with the seniority that she had accumulated prior to leave, she would have been awarded any of the positions for which she applied. After the temporary assignment was completed, respondent requested, ""due to lack of work and job openings,"" that petitioner change her status from maternity leave to termination in order that she could draw unemployment compensation.
We conclude that petitioner's policy of denying accumulated seniority to female employees returning from pregnancy leave violates § 703 (a) (2) of Title VII, 42 U.S. C. § 2000e-2 (a) (2) *140 (1970 ed., Supp. V). That section declares it to be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to
""limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee because of such individual's . . . sex . . . .""
On its face, petitioner's seniority policy appears to be neutral in its treatment of male and female employees.[2] If an employee is forced to take a leave of absence from a job because of disease or any disability other than pregnancy, the employee, whether male or female, retains accumulated seniority and, indeed, continues to accrue seniority while on leave.[3] If the employee takes a leave of absence for any other reason, including pregnancy, accumulated seniority is divested. Petitioner's decision not to treat pregnancy as a disease or disability for purposes of seniority retention is not on its face a discriminatory policy. ""Pregnancy is, of course, confined to women, but it is in other ways significantly different from the typical covered disease or disability."" Gilbert, 429 U. S., at 136.
*141 We have recognized, however, that both intentional discrimination and policies neutral on their face but having a discriminatory effect may run afoul of § 703 (a) (2). Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971). It is beyond dispute that petitioner's policy of depriving employees returning from pregnancy leave of their accumulated seniority acts both to deprive them ""of employment opportunities"" and to ""adversely affect [their] status as an employee."" It is apparent from the previous recitation of the events which occurred following respondent's return from pregnancy leave that petitioner's policy denied her specific employment opportunities that she otherwise would have obtained. Even if she had ultimately been able to regain a permanent position with petitioner, she would have felt the effects of a lower seniority level, with its attendant relegation to less desirable and lower paying jobs, for the remainder of her career with petitioner.
In Gilbert, supra, there was no showing that General Electric's policy of compensating for all non-job-related disabilities except pregnancy favored men over women. No evidence was produced to suggest that men received more benefits from General Electric's disability insurance fund than did women; both men and women were subject generally to the disabilities covered and presumably drew similar amounts from the insurance fund. We therefore upheld the plan under Title VII.
""As there is no proof that the package is in fact worth more to men than to women, it is impossible to find any gender-based discriminatory effect in this scheme simply because women disabled as a result of pregnancy do not receive benefits; that is to say, gender-based discrimination does not result simply because an employer's disability-benefits plan is less than all-inclusive. For all that appears, pregnancy-related disabilities constitute an additional risk, unique to women, and the failure to compensate them for this risk does not destroy the presumed parity of the benefits, accruing to men and women alike, *142 which results from the facially evenhanded inclusion of risks."" 429 U.S., at 138-139 (footnote omitted).
Here, by comparison, petitioner has not merely refused to extend to women a benefit that men cannot and do not receive, but has imposed on women a substantial burden that men need not suffer. The distinction between benefits and burdens is more than one of semantics. We held in Gilbert that § 703 (a) (1) did not require that greater economic benefits be paid to one sex or the other ""because of their differing roles in `the scheme of human existence,'"" 429 U.S., at 139 n. 17. But that holding does not allow us to read § 703 (a) (2) to permit an employer to burden female employees in such a way as to deprive them of employment opportunities because of their different role.[4]
*143 Recognition that petitioner's facially neutral seniority system does deprive women of employment opportunities because of their sex does not end the inquiry under § 703 (a) (2) of Title VII. If a company's business necessitates the adoption of particular leave policies, Title VII does not prohibit the company from applying these policies to all leaves of absence, including pregnancy leaves; Title VII is not violated even though the policies may burden female employees. Griggs, supra, at 431; Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 331-332, n. 14 (1977). But we agree with the District Court in this case that since there was no proof of any business necessity adduced with respect to the policies in question, that court was entitled to ""assume no justification exists.""[5] 384 F. Supp., at 771.

II
On the basis of the evidence presented to the District Court, petitioner's policy of not awarding sick-leave pay to pregnant employees is legally indistinguishable from the disability-insurance program upheld in Gilbert. As in Gilbert, petitioner compensates employees for limited periods of time during which the employee must miss work because of a non-job-related illness or disability. As in Gilbert, the compensation is not extended to pregnancy-related absences. We emphasized in Gilbert that exclusions of this kind are not per se violations of Title VII: ""[A]n exclusion of pregnancy *144 from a disability-benefits plan providing general coverage is not a gender-based discrimination at all."" 429 U.S., at 136. Only if a plaintiff through the presentation of other evidence can demonstrate that exclusion of pregnancy from the compensated conditions is a mere ""`pretex[t] designed to effect an invidious discrimination against the members of one sex or the other'"" does Title VII apply. Ibid.
In Gilbert, evidence had been introduced indicating that women drew substantially greater sums than did men from General Electric's disability-insurance program, even though it excluded pregnancy. Id., at 130-131, nn. 9 and 10. But our holding did not depend on this evidence. The District Court in Gilbert expressly declined to find ""that the present actuarial value of the coverage was equal as between men and women."" Id., at 131. We upheld the disability program on the ground ""that neither [was] there a finding, nor was there any evidence which would support a finding, that the financial benefits of the Plan `worked to discriminate against any definable group or class in terms of the aggregate risk protection derived by the group or class from the program.'"" Id., at 138. When confronted by a facially neutral plan, whose only fault is underinclusiveness, the burden is on the plaintiff to show that the plan discriminates on the basis of sex in violation of Title VII. Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 425 (1975); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973).
We again need not decide whether, when confronted by a facially neutral plan, it is necessary to prove intent to establish a prima facie violation of § 703 (a) (1). Cf. McDonnell Douglas Corp., supra, at 802-806. Griggs held that a violation of § 703 (a) (2) can be established by proof of a discriminatory effect. But it is difficult to perceive how exclusion of pregnancy from a disability insurance plan or sick-leave compensation program ""would deprive any individual of employment opportunities"" or ""otherwise adversely affect his *145 status as an employee"" in violation of § 703 (a) (2). The direct effect of the exclusion is merely a loss of income for the period the employee is not at work; such an exclusion has no direct effect upon either employment opportunities or job status. Plaintiff's attack in Gilbert, supra, was brought under § 703 (a) (1), which would appear to be the proper section of Title VII under which to analyze questions of sick-leave or disability payments.
Respondent failed to prove even a discriminatory effect with respect to petitioner's sick-leave plan. She candidly concedes in her brief before this Court that ""petitioner's Sick Leave benefit plan is, in and of itself, for all intents and purposes, the same as the Weekly Sickness and Accident Insurance Plan examined in Gilbert"" and that ""if the exclusion of sick pay was the only manner in which respondent had been treated differently by petitioner, Gilbert would control."" Brief for Respondent 10. Respondent, however, contends that because petitioner has violated Title VII by its policy respecting seniority following return from pregnancy leave, the sick-leave pay differentiation must also fall.
But this conclusion by no means follows from the premise. Respondent herself abandoned attacks on other aspects of petitioner's employment policies following rulings adverse to her by the District Court, a position scarcely consistent with her present one. We of course recognized both in Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484 (1974), and in Gilbert that the facial neutrality of an employee benefit plan would not end analysis if it could be shown that ""`distinctions involving pregnancy are mere pretexts designed to effect an invidious discrimination against the members of one sex or the other . . . .'"" Gilbert, 429 U. S., at 135. Petitioner's refusal to allow pregnant employees to retain their accumulated seniority may be deemed relevant by the trier of fact in deciding whether petitioner's sick-leave plan was such a pretext. But it most certainly does not require such a finding by a trier of fact, to *146 say nothing of the making of such a finding as an original matter by this Court.
The District Court sitting as a trier of fact made no such finding in this case, and we are not advised whether it was requested to or not. The decision of the Court of Appeals was not based on any such finding, but instead embodied generally the same line of reasoning as the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit followed in its opinion in Gilbert v. General Electric Co., 519 F.2d 661 (1975). Since we rejected that line of reasoning in our opinion in Gilbert, the judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to petitioner's sick-pay policies must be vacated. That court and the District Court are in a better position than we are to know whether respondent adequately preserved in those courts the right to proceed further in the District Court on the theory which we have just described.[6]
Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join, concurring in the result and concurring in part.
I join Part I of the opinion of the Court affirming the decision of the Court of Appeals that petitioner's policy denying *147 accumulated seniority for job-bidding purposes to female employees returning from pregnancy leave violates Title VII.[1]
I also concur in the result in Part II, for the legal status under Title VII of petitioner's policy of denying accumulated sick-pay benefits to female employees while on pregnancy leave requires further factual development in light of General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125 (1976). I write separately, however, because the Court appears to have constricted unnecessarily the scope of inquiry on remand by holding prematurely that respondent has failed to meet her burden of establishing a prima facie case that petitioner's sick-leave policy is discriminatory under Title VII. This case was tried in the District Court and reviewed in the Court of Appeals before our decision in Gilbert. The appellate court upheld her claim in accord with the then uniform view of the Courts of Appeals that any disability plan that treated *148 pregnancy differently from other disabilities was per se violative of Title VII.[2] Since respondent had no reason to make the showing of gender-based discrimination required by Gilbert, I would follow our usual practice of vacating the judgment below and remanding to permit the lower court to reconsider its sick-leave ruling in light of our intervening decision.
The issue is not simply one of burden of proof, which properly rests with the Title VII plaintiff, Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 425 (1975); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973), but of a ""full opportunity for presentation of the relevant facts,"" Harris v. Nelson, 394 U.S. 286, 298 (1969). Given the meandering course that Title VII adjudication has taken, final resolution of a lawsuit in this Court often has not been possible because the parties or the lower courts proceeded on what was ultimately an erroneous theory of the case. Where the mistaken theory is premised on the pre-existing understanding of the law, and where the record as constituted does not foreclose the arguments made necessary by our ruling, I would prefer to remand the controversy and permit the lower courts to pass on the new contentions in light of whatever additional evidence is deemed necessary.
For example, in Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, supra, the Court approved the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the employer had not proved the job relatedness of its testing program, but declined to permit immediate issuance of an *149 injunction against all use of testing in the plant. The Court thought that a remand to the District Court was indicated in part because ""[t]he appropriate standard of proof for job relatedness has not been clarified until today,"" and the plaintiffs ""have not until today been specifically apprised of their opportunity to present evidence that even validated tests might be a `pretext' for discrimination in light of alternative selection procedures available to the Company."" 422 U.S., at 436.
Similarly, in Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324 (1977), we found a remand for further factual development appropriate because the Government had employed an erroneous evidentiary approach that precluded satisfaction of its burden of identifying which nonapplicant employees were victims of the employer's unlawful discrimination and thus entitled to a retroactive seniority award. ""While it may be true that many of the nonapplicant employees desired and would have applied for line-driver jobs but for their knowledge of the company's policy of discrimination, the Government must carry its burden of proof, with respect to each specific individual, at the remedial hearings to be conducted by the District Court on remand."" Id., at 371.[3] Cf. Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590, 613-616 (1975) (POWELL, J., concurring in part).
Here, respondent has abandoned the theory that enabled her to prevail in the District Court and the Court of Appeals. Instead, she urges that her case is distinguishable from Gilbert:
""Respondent submits that because the exclusion of sick pay is only one of the many ways in which female *150 employees who experience pregnancy are treated differently by petitioner, the holding in Gilbert is not controlling. Upon examination of the overall manner in which female employees who experience pregnancy are treated by petitioner, it becomes plain that petitioner's policies are much more pervasive than the mere under-inclusiveness of the Sickness and Accident Insurance Plan in Gilbert."" Brief for Respondent 10.
At least two distinguishing characteristics are identified by respondent. First, as found by the District Court, only pregnant women are required to take a leave of absence and are denied sick-leave benefits while in all other cases of nonoccupational disability sick-leave benefits are available. 384 F. Supp. 765, 767, 771 (MD Tenn. 1974). Second, the sick-leave policy is necessarily related to petitioner's discriminatory denial of job-bidding seniority to pregnant women on mandatory maternity leave, presumably because both policies flow from the premise that a female employee is no longer in active service when she becomes pregnant.
Although respondent's theory is not fully articulated, she presents a plausible contention, one not required to have been raised until Gilbert and not foreclosed by the stipulated evidence of record, see Gilbert, 429 U. S., at 130-131, n. 9, and 131 n. 10, or the concurrent findings of the lower courts, see Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 270 (1977). It is not inconceivable that on remand respondent will be able to show that the combined operation of petitioner's mandatory maternity-leave policy[4]*151 and denial of accumulated sick-pay benefits yielded significantly less net compensation for petitioner's female employees than for the class of male employees. A number of the former, but not the latter, endured forced absence from work without sick pay or other compensation. The parties stipulated that between July 2, 1965, and August 27, 1974, petitioner had placed 12 employees on pregnancy leave, and that some of these employees were on leave for periods of two months or more. App. 33. It is possible that these women had not exhausted their sick-pay benefits at the time they were compelled to take maternity leave, and that the denial of sick pay for this period of absence resulted in a relative loss of net compensation for petitioner's female work force. Petitioner's male employees, on the other hand, are not subject to a mandatory leave policy, and are eligible to receive compensation in some form for any period of absence from work due to sickness or disability.
In short, I would not foreclose the possibility that the facts as developed on remand will support a finding that ""the package is in fact worth more to men than to women."" Gilbert, supra, at 138. If such a finding were made, I would view respondent's case as not barred by Gilbert.[5] In that case, the Court related: ""The District Court noted the evidence introduced during the trial, a good deal of it stipulated, concerning the relative cost to General Electric of providing benefits under the Plan to male and female employees, all of which indicated that, with pregnancy-related disabilities excluded, the cost of the Plan to General Electric per female employee was at least as high as, if not substantially higher than, the cost per male employee."" 429 U.S., at 130 (footnotes omitted). The District Court also ""found that the inclusion of pregnancy-related disabilities within the scope of the Plan would `increase G. E.'s [disability-benefits plan] costs *152 by an amount which, though large, is at this time undeterminable.' 375 F. Supp., at 378."" Id., at 131. While the District Court declined to make an explicit finding that the actuarial value of the coverage was equal between men and women, it may have been referring simply to the quantum and specificity of proof necessary to establish a ""business necessity"" defense. See Gilbert v. General Electric Co., 375 F. Supp. 367, 382-383 (ED Va. 1974). In any event, in Gilbert this Court viewed the evidence of record as precluding a prima facie showing of discrimination in ""compensation"" contrary to § 703 (a) (1). ""Whatever the ultimate probative value of the evidence introduced before the District Court on this subject . . . , at the very least it tended to illustrate that the selection of risks covered by the Plan did not operate, in fact, to discriminate against women."" 429 U.S., at 137-138. As the record had developed in Gilbert, there was no basis for a remand.
I do not view the record in this case as precluding a finding of discrimination in compensation within the principles enunciated in Gilbert.[6] I would simply remand the sick-pay *153 issue for further proceedings in light of our decision in that case.
MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in the judgment."
33463,per_curiam,per_curiam,True,Stanton v. Stanton,,1977,2.0,"This appeal brings before us for the second time the Utah Supreme Court's construction of Utah Code Ann. § 15-2-1 (1973),[1] which established 21 as the age of majority for males, and 18 as the age for females, as applied to a parent's obligation to support his children. In our first opinion, we held that this distinction between males and females violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U.S. 7 (1975) (Stanton I).[2] We, of course, did not decide how Utah was to eliminate the discrimination between the *502 genders, and thereby to determine at what age the appellee's duty to support his daughter terminated. Instead, we remanded the case to the Utah court for it to resolve this issue of state law. Id., at 17-18. Our mandate also directed that appellant should receive $437.38 for her costs on appeal to this Court.
On the remand, the Utah Supreme Court did not consider the issue presented to it and held, instead, that the age-of-majority statute was constitutional as applied to females without considering the discrimination. That action does not comply with our mandate.
Upon receiving the mandate in Stanton I, the Utah Supreme Court remanded the case, without directions, to the District Court of Salt Lake County. That court correctly recognized, pursuant to the parties' stipulation, that the only issue before it was whether, in the absence of a validly worded statutory provision governing child-support age of majority, both sexes should be deemed to attain majority either at age 18 or at age 21. It resolved the issue by holding that, ""for purposes of child support, children attain their majority at age 21."" Accordingly, it awarded appellant a total of $3,646.18, consisting of $2,700 past due support money, $508.80 interest on the judgment, and the $437.38 costs award from this Court.
On appeal, the Utah Supreme Court, by a 3-2 vote, reversed. 552 P.2d 112 (1976). Instead of deciding the issue before it, the majority held that the portion of the statute setting the age for females could be viewed in isolation from the portion setting the age for males:
""Obviously the two provisions of the statute are separable and the Supreme Court of the United States in remanding this matter directed that we decide which age was correct and then legislate a bit on our own and say that the age of majority so chosen for the one sex is also the age of majority for the other sex.

*503 ""The oath we took when chosen as justices of the Supreme Court of Utah forbids us to encroach on the duties and functions of the legislature. However, we need not make any such determination. The age of the male child in this divorce case has never been called into question."" Id., at 113.
The court reasoned that the only child before it was a female and, therefore, that the age of 18 provided in § 15-2-1 was constitutional and still applied. As further support for its result, the court declared that the mother had no interest in the equal protection issue and that the parties expected the age discrepancy to apply when the divorce decree was drafted. Finally, as if to erase any remaining doubt about the basis of its decision, the court declared:
""Regardless of what a judge may think about equality, his thinking cannot change the facts of life. . . .
""To judicially hold that males and females attain their maturity at the same age is to be blind to the biological facts of life."" Id., at 114.
The court then undertook to reverse the entire judgment of the District Court, even including the $437.38 derived from this Court's mandate.[3]
This decision, obviously, is inconsistent with our opinion in Stanton I. The thrust of Stanton I, and therefore the starting point for the Utah court on remand, was that males and females cannot be treated differently for child-support purposes consistently with the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. Cf. Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976). Apparently the Utah Supreme Court did not read our opinion as requiring that the child-support law must be nondiscriminatory to comply with the constitutional *504 standard. That, of course, is a misunderstanding. Accordingly, the judgment of the Utah Supreme Court is vacated, and the case once again is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.[4]
MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting in part.
Petitions for rehearing perform the wholesome function of providing the losing litigant with a legitimate forum for adverse comment on an adverse decision. Appellate judges soon learn to discount hyperbole in such petitions.
Judges who are reversed by a higher court sometimes need a similar outlet, particularly when they remain convinced that their original decision was correct. For this reason opinions on remand should occasionally be read with tolerance and understanding, and the question whether this Court's mandate has been violated should be answered by reference to the judgment entered by the lower court rather than by reaction to a few unnecessary and unfortunate sentences *505 in a separate opinion joined by only two of six members voting.
In 1975 this Court held § 15-2-1 of the Utah Code unconstitutional and directed the State of Utah to eliminate that statute's discrimination between males and females. Utah was free to select the age of 21 or the age of 18 as the age of majority for all its citizens. Thereafter as Justice Ellett pointed out in his separate opinion, the ""Legislature of Utah, in an attempt to satisfy the justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, passed an amendment to Section 15-2-1, U. C. A. 1953, so that it now reads: `The period of minority extends in males and females to the age of eighteen years . . . .' ""[1] This amendment applied only after its passage in 1975.
When this case reached the Utah Supreme Court for the second time in 1976, that court held that the pre-amendment age of majority was 18. The reasons given in the three separate opinions of the Justices constituting the majority of the court are not, in my judgment, nearly as persuasive as Justice Maughan's dissenting opinion. But, as Justice Maughan clearly recognized, the state court had the power to decide that the age of majority for both males and females under this statute prior to its amendment was either 18 or 21. The Utah Supreme Court has now held that it was 18. Even though the explanation of that holding makes reference only to females, once that determination has been made as a matter of Utah law, it applies by force of the Federal Constitution to males as well as females. Accordingly, both before and after the 1975 amendment to § 15-2-1, the statutory age of majority for both males and females in Utah was 18, not 21. The lower Utah courts are so interpreting the Utah Supreme Court decision.[2]
*506 The judgment of the Utah Supreme Court was therefore consistent with this Court's mandate, except, of course, for its disallowance of costs. Other than an order allowing appropriate costs, there is no need for any further proceedings (or opinion writing) in that court. I therefore respectfully dissent from this Court's action.

1608,Justice Stevens,concurring,False,Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty,,1977,2.0,"Petitioner enforces two policies that treat pregnant employees less favorably than other employees who incur a temporary disability. First, they are denied seniority benefits during their absence from work and thereafter; second, they are denied sick pay during their absence. The Court holds that the former policy is unlawful whereas the latter is lawful. I concur in the Court's judgment, but because I believe that its explanation of the legal distinction between the two policies may engender some confusion among those who must make compliance decisions on a day-to-day basis, I advance a separate, and rather pragmatic, basis for reconciling the two parts of the decision with each other and with General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125.
The general problem is to decide when a company policy which attaches a special burden to the risk of absenteeism caused by pregnancy is a prima facie violation of the statutory prohibition against sex discrimination. The answer ""always,"" which I had thought quite plainly correct,[1] is foreclosed by the Court's holding in Gilbert. The answer ""never"" would seem *154 to be dictated by the Court's view that a discrimination against pregnancy is ""not a gender-based discrimination at all.""[2] The Court has, however, made it clear that the correct answer is ""sometimes."" Even though a plan which frankly and unambiguously discriminates against pregnancy is ""facially neutral,"" the Court will find it unlawful if it has a ""discriminatory effect.""[3] The question, then, is how to identify this discriminatory effect.
Two possible answers are suggested by the Court. The Court seems to rely on (a) the difference between a benefit and a burden, and (b) the difference between § 703 (a) (2) and § 703 (a) (1). In my judgment, both of these differences are illusory.[4] I agree with the Court that the effect of the respondent's *155 seniority plan is significantly different from that of the General Electric disability plan in Gilbert, but I suggest that the difference may be described in this way: Although the Gilbert Court was unwilling to hold that discrimination against pregnancyas compared with other physical disabilitiesis discrimination on account of sex, it may nevertheless be true that discrimination against pregnant or formerly pregnant employeesas compared with other employeesdoes constitute sex discrimination. This distinction may be pragmatically expressed in terms of whether the employer has a policy which adversely affects a woman beyond the term of her pregnancy leave.
Although the opinion in Gilbert characterizes as ""facially neutral"" a company policy which differentiates between an absence caused by pregnancy and an absence caused by illness, the factual context of Gilbert limits the reach of that broad characterization. Under the Court's reasoning, the disability plan in Gilbert did not discriminate against pregnant employees or formerly pregnant employees while they were working for the company. If an employee, whether pregnant or nonpregnant, contracted the measles, he or she would receive disability benefits; moreover, an employee returning from maternity leave would also receive those benefits. On the other hand, pregnancy, or an illness occurring while absent on maternity leave, was not covered.[5] During that period of maternity leave, the pregnant woman was temporarily cut off from the benefits extended by the company's plan. At all other times, the woman was treated the same as other employees in terms of her eligibility for the plan's benefits.
*156 The Company's seniority plan in this case has a markedly different effect. In attempting to return to work, the formerly pregnant woman is deprived of all previously accumulated seniority. The policy affects both her ability to re-enter the work force, and her compensation when she does return.[6] The Company argues that these effects are permissible because they flow from its initial decision to treat pregnancy as an unexcused absence. But this argument misconceives the scope of the protection afforded by Gilbert to such initial decisions. For the General Electric plan did not attach any consequences to the condition of pregnancy that extended beyond the period of maternity leave. Gilbert allowed the employer to treat pregnancy leave as a temporal gap in the full employment status of a woman. During that period, the employer may treat the employee in a manner consistent with the determination that pregnancy is not an illness.[7] In this case, however, the Company's seniority policy has an adverse impact on the employee's status after pregnancy leave is terminated. The formerly pregnant person is permanently disadvantaged as compared to the rest of the work force. And since the persons adversely affected by this policy constitute an exclusively female class, the Company's plan has an obvious discriminatory effect.[8]
*157 Under this analysis, it is clear that petitioner's seniority rule discriminating against formerly pregnant employees is invalid. It is equally clear that the denial of sick pay during maternity leave is consistent with the Gilbert rationale, since the Company was free to withhold those benefits during that period.[9]
As is evident from my dissent in Gilbert, I would prefer to decide this case on a simpler rationale. Since that preference is foreclosed by Gilbert, I concur in the Court's judgment on the understanding that as the law now stands, although some discrimination against pregnancyas compared with other physical disabilitiesis permissible, discrimination against pregnant or formerly pregnant employees is not.

Shevin, 416 U.S. 351 (1974), I join the opinion and judgment of the Court.
MR."
32723,Justice Rehnquist,second_dissenting,False,Orr v. Orr,,1979,2.0,"In Alabama only wives may be awarded alimony upon divorce. In Part I of its opinion, the Court holds that Alabama's alimony statutes may be challenged in this Court by a divorced male who has never sought alimony, who is demonstrably not entitled to alimony even if he had, and who contractually bound himself to pay alimony to his former wife and did so without objection for over two years. I think the Court's eagerness to invalidate Alabama's statutes has led it to deal too casually with the ""case and controversy"" requirement of Art. III of the Constitution.

I
The architects of our constitutional form of government, to assure that courts exercising the ""judicial power of the United States"" would not trench upon the authority committed to the other branches of government, consciously limited the Judicial Branch's ""right of expounding the Constitution"" to ""cases of a Judiciary Nature""[1]that is, to actual ""cases"" and ""controversies"" between genuinely adverse parties. Central to this Art. III limitation on federal judicial power is the concept of standing. The standing inquiry focuses on the party before the Court, asking whether he has "" `such a personal *291 stake in the outcome of the controversy' as to warrant his invocation of federal-court jurisdiction and to justify exercise of the court's remedial powers on his behalf."" Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498-499 (1975) (emphasis in original), quoting Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962). Implicit in the concept of standing, are the requirements of injury in fact and causation. To demonstrate the ""personal stake"" in the litigation necessary to satisfy Art. III, the party must suffer ""a distinct and palpable injury,"" Warth v. Seldin, supra, at 501, that bears a "" `fairly traceable' causal connection"" to the challenged government action. Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 72 (1978), quoting Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 261 (1977). When a party's standing to raise an issue is questioned, therefore, ""the relevant inquiry is whether . . . [he] has shown an injury to himself that is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision."" Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 38 (1976). Stated differently, a party who places a question before a federal court must ""stand to profit in some personal interest"" from its resolution, else the exercise of judicial power would be gratuitous. Id., at 39.
The sole claim before this Court is that Alabama's alimony statutes, which provide that only husbands may be required to pay alimony upon divorce, violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Statutes alleged to create an impermissible gender-based classification are generally attacked on one of two theories. First, the challenged classification may confer on members of one sex a benefit not conferred on similarly situated members of the other sex. Clearly, members of the excluded classthose who but for their sex would be entitled to the statute's benefitshave a sufficient ""personal stake"" in the outcome of an equal protection challenge to the statute to invoke the power of the federal judiciary. Thus, a widower has standing to question *292 the constitutionality of a state statute granting a property tax exemption only to widows. See Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U.S. 351 (1974). Likewise, this Court has reached the merits of a retired male wage earner's equal protection challenge to a federal statute granting higher monthly old-age benefits to similarly situated female wage earners. See Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313 (1977). Standing to raise these constitutional claims was not destroyed by the fact that the State of Florida in Kahn, and Congress in Webster, were capable of frustrating a victory in this Court by merely withdrawing the challenged statute's benefits from the favored class rather than extending them to the excluded class. See Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U.S. 7, 17 (1975).
Second, the challenged statute may saddle members of one sex with a burden not borne by similarly situated members of the other sex. Standing to attack such a statute lies in those who labor under its burden. For example, in Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199 (1977), this Court sustained a widower's equal protection challenge to a provision of the Social Security Act that burdened widowers but not widows with the task of proving dependency upon the deceased spouse in order to qualify for survivor's benefits. A similar statute was invalidated in Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973), at the instance of a female member of the uniformed services who, unlike her male counterparts, was required to prove her spouse's dependency in order to obtain increased quarters allowances and health benefits.
The statutes at issue here differ from those discussed above in that the benefit flowing to divorced wives derives from a burden imposed on divorced husbands. Thus, Alabama's alimony statutes in effect create two gender classifications: that between needy wives, who can be awarded alimony under the statutes, and needy husbands, who cannot; and that between financially secure husbands, who can be required to pay alimony under the statutes, and financially secure wives, who *293 cannot. Appellant Orr's standing to raise his equal protection claim must therefore be analyzed in terms of both of these classifications.

A
This Court has long held that in order to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of Art. III standing, a party claiming that a statute unconstitutionally withholds a particular benefit must be in line to receive the benefit if the suit is successful. In Supervisors v. Stanley, 105 U.S. 305 (1882), shareholders of a national bank attacked the validity of a state property tax statute that did not, contrary to federal law, permit deduction of personal debts from the assessed value of their bank stock. With respect to the constitutional claim of shareholders who had failed to allege the existence of personal debts that could be deducted under a valid statute, the Court reasoned:
""What is there to render the [state statute] void as to a shareholder in a national bank, who owes no debts which he can deduct from the assessed value of his shares? The denial of this right does not affect him. He pays the same amount of tax that he would if the law gave him the right of deduction. He would be in no better condition if the law expressly authorized him to make the deduction. What legal interest has he in a question which only affects others? Why should he invoke the protection of the act of Congress in a case where he has no rights to protect? Is a court to sit and decide abstract questions of law in which the parties before it show no interest, and which, if decided either way, affect no right of theirs?
.....
"". . . If no such right exists, the delicate duty of declaring by this court that an act of State legislation is void, is an assumption of authority uncalled for by the merits *294 of the case, and unnecessary to the assertion of the rights of any party to the suit."" Id., at 311-312.
It is undisputed that the parties now before us are ""a needy wife who qualifies for alimony and a husband who has the property and earnings from which alimony can be paid."" 351 So. 2d 906, 907 (1977) (Jones, J., dissenting). Under the statute pertinent to the Orrs' divorce, alimony may be awarded against the husband only ""[i]f the wife has no separate estate or if it be insufficient for her maintenance."" Ala. Code § 30-2-51 (1975). At the time of their divorce, Mr. Orr made no claim that he was not in a position to contribute to his needy wife's support, much less that she should be required to pay alimony to him.[2] On the contrary, the amount of alimony awarded by the Alabama trial court was agreed to by the parties, and appellant has never sought a reduction in his alimony *295 obligation on the ground of changed financial circumstances. See Davis v. Davis, 274 Ala. 277, 147 So. 2d 828 (1962); Garlington v. Garlington, 246 Ala. 665, 22 So. 2d 89 (1945). On these facts, it is clear that appellant is not in a position to benefit from a sex-neutral alimony statute.[3] His standing to raise the constitutional question in this case, therefore, cannot be founded on a claim that he would, but for his sex, be entitled to an award of alimony from his wife under the Alabama statutes.

B
The Court holds that Mr. Orr's standing to raise his equal protection claim lies in the burden he bears under the Alabama statutes. He is required to pay alimony to his needy former spouse while similarly situated women are not. That *296 the State may render Mr. Orr's victory in this Court a hollow one by neutrally extending alimony rights to needy husbands does not, according to the Court, destroy his standing, for the State may elect instead to do away with alimony altogether. The possibility that Alabama will turn its back on the thousands of women currently dependent on alimony checks for their support[4] is, as a practical matter, nonexistent. But my conclusion that appellant lacks standing in this Court does not rest on the strong likelihood that Alabama will respond to today's decision by passing a sex-neutral statute. Appellant has simply not demonstrated that either alternative open to the Stateeven the entire abrogation of alimonywill free him of his burden.
The alimony obligation at issue in this case was fixed by an agreement between the parties, and appellant makes no claim that the contract is unenforceable under state law. Indeed, the Court itself concedes that ""despite the unconstitutionality of the alimony statutes. Mr. Orr may have a continuing obligation to his former wife based upon [their] agreement."" Ante, at 275. The Court casually dismisses the matter, however, as one ""which we cannot, and would not, predict."" Ante, at 276 n. 5.
I cannot accede to the Court's offhand dismissal of so serious an obstacle to the exercise of our jurisdiction. It is not our duty to establish Orr's standing to have his claim decided on the merits. On the contrary, the burden is on him ""to meet the minimum requirement of Art. III: to establish that, in fact, the asserted injury was the consequence of the [unconstitutional *297 statute], or that prospective relief will remove the harm."" Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S., at 505; Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S., at 72; Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U. S., at 260-261; Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org., 426 U. S., at 38; Linda R. S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 617 (1973). That appellant has not carried this burden is clearly demonstrated by the Court's acknowledgement that his alimony obligation may well be enforced under state contract law.
The Court's analysis of Mr. Orr's standing is not aided by its attempt to transform the instant case into one involving race discrimination. See ante, at 273. Of course, a state law imposing alimony obligations on blacks but not whites could be challenged by a black required, by operation of the statute, to pay alimony. Invalidation of the discriminatory alimony statute would relieve him of his burden. If, however, his alimony obligation was enforceable under state contract law independent of the challenged alimony statute, he could hardly argue that his injury was caused by the challenged statute. Invalidation of the statute would bring him no relief. Accordingly, the exercise of federal judicial power on his behalf ""would be gratuitous and thus inconsistent with the Art. III limitation."" Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org., supra, at 38.
Nor is the Court's conclusion supported by Linda R. S. v. Richard D., supra. At issue in Linda R. S. was a state statute subjecting to criminal prosecution any ""parent"" failing to support his ""children."" State courts had consistently construed the statute to apply solely to the parents of legitimate children and to impose no duty of support on the parents of illegitimate children. The mother of an illegitimate child, claiming that the ""discriminatory application"" of the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause, sought an injunction directing the local district attorney to prosecute the father of her child for violating the statute. This Court held that she lacked standing *298 to raise her claim. While she ""no doubt suffered an injury stemming from the failure of her child's father to contribute support payments,"" she had made ""no showing that her failure to secure support payments result[ed] from the nonenforcement, as to her child's father, of [the child-support statute]."" 410 U.S., at 618.
""Thus, if appellant were granted the requested relief, it would result only in the jailing of the child's father. The prospect that prosecution will, at least in the future, result in payment of support can, at best, be termed only speculative. Certainly the `direct' relationship between the alleged injury and the claim sought to be adjudicated which previous decisions of this Court suggest is a prerequisite of standing, is absent in this case."" Ibid.

Like appellant in Linda R. S., Mr. Orr has failed to show a ""substantial likelihood""[5] that the requested relief will result in termination of his alimony obligation. Thus, far from supporting the Court's finding of standing in appellant Orr, Linda R. S. leads inescapably to the opposite conclusion.[6]


*299 II
Nor is appellant's lack of standing somehow cured by the fact that the state courts reached and decided the merits of his constitutional claim. Article III is a jurisdictional limitation on federal courts, and a state court cannot transform an abstract or hypothetical question into a ""case or controversy"" merely by ruling on its merits. In Doremus v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 429 (1952), this Court held that a taxpayer lacked the requisite financial interest in the outcome of a First Amendment challenge to a state statute requiring Bible reading in public schools. In dismissing the taxpayer's appeal from an adverse ruling in the State's highest court, this Court held:
""We do not undertake to say that a state court may not render an opinion on a federal constitutional question even under such circumstances that it can be regarded only as advisory. But, because our own jurisdiction is cast in terms of `case or controversy' we cannot accept as the basis for review, nor as the basis for conclusive disposition of an issue of federal law without review, any procedure which does not constitute such."" Id., at 434.
Appellant's case, having come to us on appeal rather than on writ of certiorari, is much like Marbury's case in that Congress conferred upon each litigant the right to have his claim heard in this Court. But here, as in Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), and Doremus, supra, we are, in my opinion, prevented by Art. III of the Constitution from exercising the jurisdiction which Congress has sought to confer upon us.

III
Article III courts are not commissioned to roam at large, gratuitously righting perceived wrongs and vindicating claimed rights. They must await the suit of one whose advocacy is inspired by a ""personal stake"" in victory. The Framers' *300 wise insistence that those who invoke the power of a federal court personally stand to profit from its exercise ensures that constitutional issues are not decided in advance of necessity and that the complaining party stand in the shoes of those whose rights he champions. Obedience to the rules of standingthe ""threshold determinants of the propriety of judicial intervention""[7]is of crucial importance to constitutional adjudication in this Court, for when the parties leave these halls, what is done cannot be undone except by constitutional amendment.
Much as ""Caesar had his Brutus; Charles the First his Cromwell,"" Congress and the States have this Court to ensure that their legislative Acts do not run afoul of the limitations imposed by the United States Constitution. But this Court has neither a Brutus nor a Cromwell to impose a similar discipline on it. While our ""right of expounding the Constitution"" is confined to ""cases of a Judiciary Nature,"" we are empowered to determine for ourselves when the requirements of Art. III are satisfied. Thus, ""the only check upon our own exercise of power is our own sense of self-restraint."" United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1, 79 (1936) (Stone, J., dissenting). I do not think the Court, in deciding the merits of appellant's constitutional claim, has exercised the self-restraint that Art. III requires in this case. I would therefore dismiss Mr. Orr's appeal on the authority of Doremus v. Board of Education, supra.

21132,Justice Blackmun,majority,False,Califano v. Westcott,,1979,2.0,"Section 407 of the Social Security Act, 75 Stat. 75, as amended, 42 U.S. C. § 607, part of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, provides benefits to families whose dependent children have been deprived of parental support because of the unemployment of the father, but does not provide such benefits when the mother becomes unemployed. The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts held that this distinction violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and ordered that benefits be paid to families deprived of support because of the unemployment of the mother to the same extent they are paid to families deprived of support because of the unemployment of the father. 460 F. Supp. 737 (1978). In these appeals, the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), in No. 78-437; challenges the holding on the constitutionality of § 407, but does not question the relief ordered by the District Court; the Commissioner of the Massachusetts *79 Department of Public Welfare (DPW), in No. 78-689, acquiesces in the decision on the merits, but contests the relief.

I
The Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, 49 Stat. 626, as amended, 42 U.S. C. § 601 et seq., provides financial assistance to families with needy dependent children. The program is administered by participating States, in conformity with federal standards, and is financed by the Federal Government and the States on a matchingfunds basis. King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309, 316-317 (1968); Shea v. Vialpando, 416 U.S. 251, 253 (1974).
As originally enacted in 1935, the AFDC program provided benefits to families whose dependent children were needy because of the death, absence, or incapacity of a parent. Batterton v. Francis, 432 U.S. 416, 418 (1977). This provision, which forms the core of the AFDC program today, is gender neutral: benefits are available to any family so long as one parent of either sex is dead, absent from the home, or incapacitated, and the family otherwise meets the financial requirements of eligibility. 42 U.S. C. § 606.
In 1961, and again in 1962, Congress temporarily extended the AFDC program to provide assistance to families whose dependent children were deprived of support because of a parent's unemployment. Batterton v. Francis, 432 U. S., at 419; Philbrook v. Glodgett, 421 U.S. 707, 709-710 (1975). Again, this provision was gender neutral. A ""dependent child,"" for purposes of determining eligibility for AFDC benefits, was defined to include ""a needy child . . . who has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the unemployment. . . of a parent."" 75 Stat. 75 (emphasis added).
In 1968, as part of a general revision of the Social Security Act, Congress made this extension permanent. In so doing, however, it added a gender qualification to the statute. The *80 definition of ""dependent child"" in § 407 was amended to include a ""needy child . . . who has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the unemployment . . . of his father."" 42 U.S. C. § 607 (a) (emphasis added). This portion of the AFDC program is known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Unemployed Father (AFDC-UF). Although all 50 States have chosen to participate in the basic AFDC program, only 26 States (plus Guam and the District of Columbia) take part in the AFDC-UF program. One of these is the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
Appellees are two couples who, it is stipulated, satisfy all the requirements for AFDC-UF benefits[1] except for the requirement that the unemployed parent be the father. Cindy and William Westcott are married and have an infant son. They applied to the Massachusetts DPW for public assistance, but were informed that they did not qualify because William, who was unable to find work, had not previously been employed for a sufficient period to qualify as an ""unemployed"" father under the Act and applicable regulations. Cindy, until her recent unemployment, was the family breadwinner, and would have satisfied the ""unemployment"" criteria had she been male.
Susan and John Westwood are also married and have an *81 infant son. They applied for Medicaid benefits as a family eligible for, but not receiving, AFDC-UF benefits.[2] They, too, were turned down on the ground that John's prior work history was insufficient. Susan, like Cindy Westcott, had been the family breadwinner before losing her job, and would have qualified the family for benefits had she been male.
Appellees instituted this class action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, naming as defendants the Secretary of HEW and the Commissioner of the DPW. Appellees alleged that § 407 and its implementing regulations discriminate on the basis of gender in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief.
The District Court certified the case as a class action,[3] and granted appellees' motion for summary judgment. 460 F. Supp. 737 (1978). The court found that the gender qualification of § 407 was not substantially related to the achievement of any important governmental interests. 460 F. Supp., at 748-751. It was, rather, the product of an ""archaic and overbroad generalization""-that ""mothers in two parent families *82 are not breadwinners, so that loss of their earnings would not substantially affect the families' well being."" Id., at 751. The court accordingly declared § 407 unconstitutional ""insofar as it establishes a classification which discriminates . . . solely on the basis of sex."" 460 F. Supp., at 754.
The District Court then turned to the question of relief. The court saw two remedial alternatives: a simple injunction against further operation of the AFDC-UF program, or extension of the program to all families with needy children where either parent is unemployed. Id., at 753. The court decided that extension, rather than nullification, was the proper remedial course; it noted the strength of Congress' commitment to the ""specific goal of assisting needy children,"" and emphasized that if provision of benefits ""were halted because of the constitutional defect, many persons would lose their very means of subsistence."" Id., at 753-754. The court therefore, by order dated April 20, 1978, enjoined the Commissioner from refusing to grant benefits to families made needy by the unemployment of the mother ""in the same amounts and under the same standards"" as he grants benefits to families made needy by the unemployment of the father. App. to Juris. Statement in No. 78-437, pp. 41A-42A. The court likewise enjoined the Secretary from refusing to provide federal matching funds for payment of such benefits. Id., at 40A-41A.
Although the Commissioner originally had agreed that this was the appropriate remedy, Juris. Statement in No. 78-689, p. 6, he later sought modification of the District Court's order, so as to effect a more limited extension of the AFDC-UF program. The Commissioner requested that he be permitted to pay benefits ""only to those families where needy children have been deprived of parental support or care by the unemployment of the family's principal wage-earner."" App. to Juris. Statement in No. 78-689, p. 3a (emphasis added).[4] This *83 modification, he argued, would accomplish a gender-neutral extension of the program at a much lower cost. Id., at 4a. On August 9, 1978, the District Court denied the Commissioner's motion, believing that ""any reformulation of the statutory scheme . . . which goes beyond the remedy already ordered in this case is properly left to Congressional action."" Id., at 13a.
The Secretary, pursuant to 28 U.S. C. § 1252, appealed directly to this Court from the District Court's April 20 decision holding § 407 unconstitutional. App. to Juris. Statement in No. 78-437, p. 43A. The Commissioner took a separate appeal, also pursuant to § 1252, from the District Court's August 9 refusal to modify its remedial order. App. to Juris. Statement in No. 78-689, p. 15a. We noted probable jurisdiction and consolidated the cases for argument. 439 U.S. 1044 (1978).

II

THE SECRETARY'S APPEAL
The Secretary advances two arguments in support of the constitutionality of § 407. First, he contends that although § 407 incorporates a gender distinction, it does not discriminate against women as a class. Second, he urges that the distinction is substantially related to the achievement of an important governmental objective: the need to deter real or pretended desertion by the father in order to make his family eligible for AFDC benefits.

A
The Secretary readily concedes that § 407 entails a gender distinction. Brief for Appellant in No. 78-437, p. 36. He submits, however, that the Act does not award AFDC benefits to a father where it denies them to a mother. Rather, the grant or denial of aid based on the father's unemployment *84 necessarily affects, to an equal degree, one man, one woman, and one or more children. As the Secretary puts it, even if the statute is ""gender-based,"" it is not ""gender-biased."" Ibid.
We are not persuaded by this analysis. For mothers who are the primary providers for their families, and who are unemployed, § 407 is obviously gender biased, for it deprives them and their families of benefits solely on the basis of their sex. The Secretary's argument, at bottom, turns on the fact that the impact of the gender qualification is felt by family units rather than individuals. But this Court has not hesitated to strike down gender classifications that result in benefits being granted or denied to family units on the basis of the sex of the qualifying parent. See Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973) (military quarters allowances and medical and dental benefits); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636 (1975) (survivor's benefits); Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199 (1977) (survivor's benefits); Califano v. Jablon, 430 U.S. 924 (1977), summarily aff'g 399 F. Supp. 118 (Md. 1975) (spousal benefits). Here, as in those cases, the statute ""discriminates against one particular category of familythat in which the female spouse is a wage earner."" Goldfarb, 430 U. S., at 209 (plurality opinion).
The Secretary appears to acknowledge the force of these precedents, but suggests that each involved benefits that either were a form of compensation earned by a woman as a member of the labor force, or were directly related to such compensation. In the present case, in contrast, the benefits are part of a noncontributory welfare program. Thus, the Secretary argues, the gender qualification of § 407 is distinguishable from those contained in the earlier cases, for it does not denigrate ""the efforts of women who do work and whose earnings contribute significantly to their families' support."" Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S., at 645.
The distinction between employment-related benefits and other forms of government largesse may be relevant to equal *85 protection analysis, for example in determining whether the differential treatment of survivor's benefits denigrates the efforts of the deceased spouse. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S., at 645-647; Goldfarb, 430 U. S., at 206-207 (plurality opinion). This does not mean, however, that the Constitution is indifferent to a statute that conditions the availability of noncontributory welfare benefits on the basis of gender. The Secretary's argument to the contrary in effect invites a return to the discredited view that welfare benefits are a ""privilege"" not subject to the guarantee of equal protection. See Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 374 (1971). Putting labels aside, the exclusion here is if anything more pernicious than those in Frontiero, Wiesenfeld, and Goldfarb. AFDC-UF benefits are not ""fringe benefits,"" nor are they a type of social assistance paid without regard to need. Rather, they are subsistence payments made available as a last resort to families that would otherwise lack basic necessities. The deprivation imposed by § 407, moreover, is not a mere procedural barrier, like the proof-of-dependency requirement in Frontiero and Goldfarb, but is an absolute bar to qualification for aid. We therefore reject the contention that the classification imposed by § 407 does not discriminate on the basis of gender.

B
The Secretary next argues that the gender distinction imposed by § 407 survives constitutional scrutiny because it is substantially related to achievement of an important governmental objective. Orr v. Orr, 440 U.S. 268, 279 (1979); Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313, 316-317 (1977); Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190. 197 (1976). The Secretary identifies two important objectives served by § 407.
First and most obviously, the statute was intended to provide aid for children deprived of basic sustenance because of a parent's unemployment. H. R. Rep. No. 28, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1961). As then HEW Secretary Ribicoff put it in *86 testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee, ""there is no justification whatsoever for denying to the child of the unemployed parent the food that you give to the child of the parent who deserts or is absent or dead."" Hearings on H. R. 3864 and 3865 before the House Committee on Ways and Means, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 102 (1961). The appellant Secretary does not contend, however, that the gender qualification of § 407 serves to achieve this goal. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 7-8. Nor could he, since families where the mother is the principal wage earner and is unemployed are often in as much need of AFDC-UF benefits and Medicaid as families where the father is unemployed.
Second, the statute was designed to remedy a structural fault in the original AFDC program. Under that program, a family was eligible for benefits if deprived of parental support because of the ""continued absence from the home . . . of a parent."" 42 U.S. C. § 606 (a). In times of economic adversity, this provision was thought to create an incentive for the father to desert, or to pretend to desert, in order to make the family eligible for assistance. Section 407, by providing AFDC benefits to families rendered needy by parental unemployment, was intended to reduce this incentive and thereby promote the goal of family stability. The Secretary submits that reducing the incentive for the father to desert was an important objective of the AFDC-UF program, and he argues that the gender qualification is substantially related to its achievement.
We perceive, however, at least two flaws in this argument. Although it is relatively clear that Congress was concerned about the problem of parental desertion, see S. Rep. No. 744. 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 160 (1967); H. R. Rep. No. 28, 87th Cong., 1st Sess.,2 (1961), there is no evidence that the gender distinction was designed to address this problem. See Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S., at 648. Both the original AFDC program, and the temporary versions of the AFDC-UF *87 program enacted in 1961 and 1962, were gender neutral. The gender qualification added to the permanent version of AFDC-UF in 1968 escaped virtually unnoticed in the hearings and floor debates.[5] The only explanation for this addition is contained in the following passage, which appears in nearly identical form in both the House and Senate Reports:
""This program was originally conceived by Congress as one to provide aid for the children of unemployed fathers. However, some States make families in which the father is working but the mother is unemployed eligible for assistance. The bill would not allow such situations. Under the bill, the program could apply only to the children of unemployed fathers."" S. Rep. No. 744, at 160.
See also H. R. Rep. No. 554, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 108 (1967).
This suggests that the gender qualification was part of the general objective of the 1968 amendments to tighten standards for eligibility and reduce program costs.[6] Congress was concerned that certain States were making AFDC-UF assistance available to families where the mother was out of work, but the father remained fully employed and able to support *88 the family. Apparently, Congress was not similarly concerned about States making benefits available where the father was out of work, but the mother remained fully employed. From all that appears, Congress, with an image of the ""traditional family"" in mind, simply assumed that the father would be the family breadwinner, and that the mother's employment role, if any, would be secondary. In short, the available evidence indicates that the gender distinction was inserted to reduce costs and eliminate what was perceived to be a type of superfluous eligibility for AFDC-UF benefits. There is little to suggest that the gender qualification had anything to do with reducing the father's incentive to desert.[7]
Even if the actual purpose of the gender qualification was to deal with the problem of paternal desertion, it does not appear that the classification is substantially related to the achievement of that goal. The Secretary argues there is ""[s]olid statistical evidence"" that fathers are more susceptible to pressure to desert than mothers, and thus that Congress was justified in excluding families headed by unemployed mothers from the AFDC-UF program. Brief for Appellant in No. 78-437, p. 33. We may assume, for purposes of discussion, that Congress could legitimately view paternal desertion as a problem separate and distinct from maternal desertion. Even so, the gender qualification of § 407 is not substantially related to the stated purpose. There is no evidence, in the legislative history or elsewhere, that a father has less incentive to desert in a family where the mother is the breadwinner and becomes unemployed, than in a family where the father is the breadwinner and becomes unemployed. In either case, the family's need will be equally great, and the father will be equally subject to pressure to leave the home to make the *89 family eligible for benefits. The Secretary urges that Congress could take ""one firm step"" toward the goal of eliminating the incentive to desert, quoting Califano v. Jobst, 434 U.S. 47, 57-58 (1977). But Congress may not legislate ""one step at a time"" when that step is drawn along the line of gender, and the consequence is to exclude one group of families altogether from badly needed subsistence benefits. Cf. Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 489 (1955).
We conclude that the gender classification of § 407 is not substantially related to the attainment of any important and valid statutory goals. It is, rather, part of the ""baggage of sexual stereotypes,"" Orr v. Orr, 440 U. S., at 283, that presumes the father has the ""primary responsibility to provide a home and its essentials,"" Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U.S. 7, 10 (1975), while the mother is the ""`center of home and family life.'"" Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 534 n. 15 (1975). Legislation that rests on such presumptions, without more, cannot survive scrutiny under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

III

THE COMMISSIONER'S APPEAL

A
""Where a statute is defective because of underinclusion,"" Mr. Justice Harlan noted, ""there exist two remedial alternatives: a court may either declare [the statute] a nullity and order that its benefits not extend to the class that the legislature intended to benefit, or it may extend the coverage of the statute to include those who are aggrieved by the exclusion."" Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 361 (1970) (concurring in result). In previous cases involving equal protection challenges to underinclusive federal benefits statutes, this Court has suggested that extension, rather than nullification, is the proper course. See, e.g., Jimenez v. Weinberger, 417 U.S. 628, 637-638 (1974); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S., at 691 and n. 25 (plurality opinion). Indeed, *90 this Court regularly has affirmed District Court judgments ordering that welfare benefits be paid to members of an unconstitutionally excluded class. E. g., Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199 (1977), aff'g 396 F. Supp. 308, 309 (EDNY 1975); Califano v. Silbowitz, 430 U.S. 924 (1977), summarily aff'g 397 F. Supp. 862, 871 (SD Fla. 1975); Jablon v. Califano, 430 U.S. 924 (1977), summarily aff'g 399 F. Supp. 118, 132-133 (Md. 1975); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636 (1975), aff'g 367 F. Supp. 981, 991 (NJ 1973); United States Dept. of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528 (1973), aff'g 345 F. Supp. 310, 315-316 (DC 1972); Richardson v. Griffin, 409 U.S. 1069 (1972), summarily aff'g 346 F. Supp. 1226, 1237 (Md.).
The District Court ordered extension rather than invalidation by way of remedy here, and equitable considerations surely support its choice. Approximately 300,000 needy children currently receive AFDC-UF benefits, see 42 Soc. Sec. Bull. 78 (Jan. 1979), and an injunction suspending the program's operation would impose hardship on beneficiaries whom Congress plainly meant to protect. The presence in the Social Security Act of a strong severability clause, 42 U.S. C. § 1303,[8] likewise counsels against nullification, for it evidences a congressional intent to minimize the burdens imposed by a declaration of unconstitutionality upon innocent recipients of government largesse.
There is no need, however, to elaborate here the conditions under which invalidation rather than extension of an under-inclusive federal benefits statute should be ordered, for no party has presented that issue for review. All parties before the District Court agreed that extension was the appropriate remedy. Juris. Statement in No. 78-689, p. 6; Motion to Affirm 5; Juris. Statement in No. 78-437, p. 6 n. 5. Appellees *91 support that remedy here, and the Secretary, while arguing in favor of § 407's constitutionality, urges that, if the statute is invalidated, the District Court's remedy should be affirmed. Brief for Federal Appellee in No. 78-689, pp. 5-10. The Commissioner likewise argues that extension, rather than nullification, is proper, Tr. of Oral Arg. 18; indeed, the Commissioner did not appeal from the District Court's April 20 extension order, but only from its August 9 refusal to limit extension along ""principal wage-earner"" lines. App. to Juris. Statement in No. 78-689, p. 15a. Since no party has presented the issue of extension versus nullification for review, we would be inclined to consider it only if the power to order extension were clearly beyond the constitutional competence of a federal district court. This Court's previous decisions, however, which routinely have affirmed District Court judgments ordering extension of federal welfare programs, suggest strongly that no such remedial incapacity exists.

B
The narrower question presented by the Commissioner's appeal concerns not the merits of extension versus nullification, but rather the form that extension should take. The District Court ordered that benefits be paid to families in which either the mother or the father is unemployed within the meaning of the Act. The Commissioner agrees that either the mother's or the father's unemployment should be able to qualify a needy family for benefits, but proposes to award them only if the parent in question can show that he or she is both unemployed and the family's ""principal wage-earner."" Citing the legislative history of the AFDC-UF program, the Commissioner argues that his proposed remedy comports with Congress' intent to aid families made needy by their breadwinner's unemployment. This argument, as the preceding portions of this opinion show, is not without force. We may assume arguendo that, if Congress knew in 1968 what it knows now, it might well have adopted the ""principal wage-earner"" *92 model suggested by the Commissioner. But this does not mean that the AFDC-UF program should be restructured along these lines by a federal court.
First, the Commissioner's proposed remedy would have the effect of terminating benefits to many families currently receiving them. Under the Act and implementing regulations, benefits are paid to needy families of all unemployed fathers, whether or not the father is actually the ""principal wage-earner."" See 42 U.S. C. § 607 (a); 45 CFR § 233.100 (a) (1) (1978). No one contends that the Act and regulations, insofar as they provide benefits to families of all unemployed fathers, are invalid. Absent some such showing of invalidity, we would hesitate to terminate needy families' entitlement to statutory benefits merely because the unemployed father cannot prove ""breadwinner"" status.
Second, the Commissioner's proposed remedy would involve a restructuring of the Act that a court should not undertake lightly. Whenever a court extends a benefits program to redress unconstitutional underinclusiveness, it risks infringing legislative prerogatives. The extension ordered by the District Court possesses at least the virtue of simplicity: by ordering that ""father"" be replaced by its gender-neutral equivalent, the court avoided disruption of the AFDC-UF program, for benefits simply will be paid to families with an unemployed parent on the same terms that benefits have long been paid to families with an unemployed father. The ""principal wage-earner"" solution, by contrast, would introduce a term novel in the AFDC scheme,[9] and would pose definitional and policy questions best suited to legislative or administrative elaboration. The Commissioner, with his ""principal wage-earner"" gloss on parental unemployment, in essence asks this Court to redefine ""unemployment"" within the meaning of the *93 Act. Yet ""Congress in § 407 (a) expressly delegated to the Secretary the power to prescribe standards for determining what constitutes `unemployment' for purposes of AFDC-UF eligibility. In a situation of this kind, Congress entrusts to the Secretary, rather than to the courts, the primary responsibility for interpreting the statutory term."" Batterton v. Francis, 432 U. S., at 425 (emphasis in original).
The remedy the Commissioner proposes, of course, undeniably would be cheaper than the remedy the District Court decreed, in part because it would terminate some current recipients' eligibility. Although cost may prove a dispositive factor in other contexts, we do not regard it as controlling here. The United States, which will bear the main burden of added coverage through federal matching grants, urges that the District Court's remedy be affirmed. The AFDC-UF program, furthermore, is optional with the States, id., at 431, and any State is free to drop out of it if dissatisfied with the added expense. This Court, in any event, is ill-equipped both to estimate the relative costs of various types of coverage, and to gauge the effect that different levels of expenditures would have upon the alleviation of human suffering. Under these circumstances, any fine-tuning of AFDC coverage along ""principal wage-earner"" lines is properly left to the democratic branches of the Government. In sum, we believe the District Court, in an effort to render the AFDC-UF program gender neutral, adopted the simplest and most equitable extension possible.
The judgment of the District Court accordingly is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
I agree with the Court that § 407 violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment. In my view, however, *94 the court below erred when it ordered the extension of benefits to all families in which a mother has become unemployed. This extension reinstates a system of distributing benefits that Congress rejected when it amended § 407 in 1968. Rather than frustrate the clear intent of Congress, the court simply should have enjoined any further payment of benefits under the provision found to be unconstitutional.
As Mr. Justice Harlan observed:
""Where a statute is defective because of underinclusion there exist two remedial alternatives: a court may either declare it a nullity and order that its benefits not extend to the class that the legislature intended to benefit, or it may extend the coverage of the statute to include those who are aggrieved by exclusion."" Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 361 (1970) (concurring in result).
In choosing between these alternatives, a court should attempt to accommodate as fully as possible the policies and judgments expressed in the statutory scheme as a whole. See id., at 365-366, and n. 18. It should not use its remedial powers to circumvent the intent of the legislature.
The Court correctly observes that ""the gender qualification [of § 407] was part of the general objective of the 1968 amendments to tighten standards for eligibility and reduce program costs."" Ante, at 87. It is clear that Congress intended to proscribe the payment of benefits to families where only one parent was unemployed and where the principal wage earner continued to work.
""From all that appears, Congress, with an image of the `traditional family' in mind, simply assumed that the father would be the family breadwinner, and that the mother's employment role, if any, would be secondary."" Ante, at 88.
Yet the result of the Court's decision affirming the District *95 Court's relief is to compel exactly the extension of benefits Congress wished to prevent.[1]
Rather than thus rewriting § 407, we should leave this task to Congress. Now that we have held that this statute constitutes impressible gender-based discrimination, it is the duty and function of the Legislative Branch to review its AFDC-UF program in light of our decision and make such changes therein as it deems appropriate. Leaving the resolution to Congress is especially desirable in cases such as this one, where the allocation and distribution of welfare funds are peculiarly within the province of the Legislative Branch. See Califano v. Jobst, 434 U.S. 47 (1977); Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 479 (1977); Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471 (1970).
We cannot predict what Congress will think to be in the best interest of its total welfare program. The extension of AFDC benefits to families suffering only from unemployment was a relatively recent development in the history of the program, a development that Congress made permanent only on the understanding that payments could be limited to cases where the principal wage earner was out of work. We cannot assume that Congress in 1968 would have approved this extension *96 if it had known that ultimately payments would be made whenever either parent became unemployed. Nor can we assume that Congress now would adopt such a system in light of the Court's ruling that § 407 is invalid.
The Court emphasizes the hardships that may be caused by enjoining the program until Congress can act. There is the possibility, not mentioned by the Court, that other hardships might be occasioned in the allocating of limited funds as a result of court-ordered extension of these particular benefits. In any event, Congress has the option to mitigate hardships by providing promptly for retroactive payments. An injunction prohibiting further payments at least will conserve the funds appropriated until Congress determines which group, if any, it does want to assist. The relief ordered by the Court today, in contrast, ensures the irretrievable payment of funds to a class of recipients Congress did not wish to benefit.[2]
Because it is clear that Congress intended to prevent the result mandated today, and that the re-examination of § 407 required under our decision properly should be made by Congress, I dissent.
"
5572,Justice Rehnquist,dissenting,False,Duren v. Missouri,,1979,2.0,"The Court steadfastly maintained in Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522 (1975), when it ""distinguished"" Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U.S. 57 (1961), that its holding rested on the jury trial requirement of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments and not on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Today's decision makes a halfhearted effort to continue *371 that fiction in footnotes 1 and 26, declaring that cases based on the Equal Protection Clause, such as Alexander v. Louisiana, 405 U.S. 625 (1972), are not ""entirely analogous"" to the case at hand. The difference apparently lies in the fact, among others, that under equal protection analysis prima facie challenges are rebuttable by proof of absence of intent to discriminate, while under Sixth Amendment analysis intent is irrelevant, but the State may show ""adequate justification"" for the disproportionate representation of the classes being compared. We are reminded, however, that disproportionately may not be justified ""on merely rational grounds"" and that justification requires that ""a significant state interest be manifestly and primarily advanced"" by the exemption criteria resulting in the disproportionate representation. Ante, at 367 (emphasis supplied). That this language has strong overtones of equal protection is demonstrated in this Court's most recent application of the Equal Protection Clause to distinctions between men and women: ""`[C]lassifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.'"" Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199, 210-211 (1977) (plurality opinion), quoting Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 (1976) (emphasis supplied). The Constitution does not require, and our jurisprudence is ill served, by a hybrid doctrine such as that developed in Taylor, and in this case.[*]
*372 Even if I were able to reconcile the Court's agile amalgamation of the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in deciding this case *373 and Taylor, I have no little concern about where the road upon which the Court has embarked will ultimately lead. In Taylor, the Court relied upon cases dealing with outright exclusion of racial groups, Smith v. Texas, 311 U.S. 128 (1940), and of women, Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187 (1946), from jury service. Although in Smith, the exclusion had been covert, in Ballard the exclusion had been overt. The Court in Taylor concluded, I assume on the basis of these cases, that ""women cannot be systematically excluded from jury panels from which petit juries are drawn."" 419 U.S., at 533.
In Taylor, as in Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U.S. 57 (1961), *374 women had not been actually prohibited or excluded from serving on juries. But requirements, inapplicable to men, that they affirmatively make known to the jury commissioner their desire to serve had for all practical purposes had that effect. Indeed, in Taylor not one woman appeared on a venire of 175 persons drawn for jury service in the parish in question. 419 U.S., at 524. Taylor, by its language and on its facts, was an ""exclusion"" case.
Here, on the other hand, the Court in one sentence both asserts that it can, and admits that it cannot, treat the system used in Jackson County, Mo., as one which ""excludes"" women, saying: ""Today we hold that such systematic exclusion of women that results in jury venires averaging less than 15% female violates the Constitution's fair-cross-section requirement."" Ante, at 360. If there are indeed 15% women on the jury panels in Jackson County, the Court uses the word ""exclusion"" contrary to any use of the word with which I am familiar. Women are undoubtedly underrepresented as compared to men on Jackson County juries, but therein lies the difference between this case and Taylor.
Eventually the Court either will insist that women be treated identically to men for purposes of jury selection (which is intimated in dicta, ante, at 365-366, 370), or in some later sequel to this line of cases will discover some peculiar magic in the number 15 that will enable it to distinguish between such a percentage and higher percentages less than 50. But whichever of these routes the Court chooses to travel when the question is actually presented, its decision today puts state legislators and local jury commissioners at a serious disadvantage wholly unwarranted by the constitutional provisions upon which it relies. If the Court ultimately concludes that men and women must be treated exactly alike for purposes of jury service, it will have imposed substantial burdens upon many women, particularly in less populated areas, without necessarily producing any corresponding increase in the representative *375 character of jury panels. If it ultimately concludes that a percentage of women on jury panels greater than 15 but substantially less than 50 is permissible even though the State's jury selection system permits women but not men to ""opt out"" of jury service, it is simply playing a constitutional numbers game.
The attorneys general and prosecuting attorneys in the various States, sensibly concluding that a 15% representation of women on jury venires cannot in any rational legal system be materially different from a 20% representation, will press legislators and jury commissioners to abolish all distinctions between men and women for purposes of jury service. Understandably unhappy with the prospect of having still more convictions for armed robbery or murder set aside at the behest of male defendants claiming that women were insufficiently represented on their jury panel, these state attorneys will make their informed but inevitably parochial views known in the halls of their respective legislatures. These views will presumably be in harmony with those of the organized women's groups that have appeared as amici curiae in similar cases, asserting that the Constitution prohibits women from being given a choice as to whether they will serve on juries when men are required to serve.
Nor are distinctions between men and women in jury selections likely to be the only casualties to result from today's opinion. Apparently realizing the desirability of some predictability if otherwise fairly tried defendants are to be freed on the basis of such a constitutional numbers game, the Court ventures the view that an ""exemption appropriately tailored"" to the State's interest in ensuring that those members of the family responsible for the care of children are available to perform such care would ""survive a fair-cross-section challenge."" Ante, at 370. It also repeats the ""observation"" made in Taylor that it is ""unlikely that reasonable exemptions, such as those based on special hardship, incapacity, *376 or community needs, `would pose substantial threats that the remaining pool of jurors would not be representative of the community.'"" Ibid. But the States are warned that the Constitution requires them to ""exercise proper caution in exempting broad categories of persons from jury service,"" even though ""most occupational and other reasonable exemptions may inevitably involve some degree of overinclusiveness or underinclusiveness. . . ."" Ibid.
The lot of a legislator or judge attempting to conform a State's jury selection process to the dictates of today's opinion, and yet recognize what may be very valid state interests in excusing some individuals or classes of individuals from jury service, is surely not a happy one. Will the Court's above-quoted dicta soon meet the same fate that the decision in Hoyt v. Florida, supra, met in Taylor, or will they survive longer?
There is more than adequate documentation for the proposition that jury service is not a pleasant experience in many jurisdictions and that it tends to be time consuming and often seemingly useless from the point of view of the prospective juror. To the extent that States may engage in the process of jury selection by broad classifications, and by a system of exemptions which require a minimum of administrative effort, the frustrations of jury service will be at least in part alleviated, and perhaps the Court's stated goal of a ""fair cross section"" actually advanced. On the other hand, to the extent that such forms of selection are deemed constitutionally impermissible, and case-by-case ""opting out"" required with respect to each prospective juror, the ordeal of the prospective juror becomes more burdensome, and the State's administrative task more time consuming. Since most States will undoubtedly wish to immunize otherwise valid criminal convictions against reversal on the basis of the Court's most recent exegesis of the Fourteenth Amendment's requirements on the jury selection process, their natural tendency will be *377 to impose these burdens on citizen jurors and judicial administrators in order to avoid any possibility of a successful constitutional attack on the composition of the jury.
The probability, then, is that today's decision will cause States to abandon not only gender-based but also occupation-based classifications for purposes of jury service. Doctors and nurses, though virtually irreplaceable in smaller communities, may ultimately be held by the Court to bring their own ""flavor"" or ""indefinable something"" to a jury venire. See supra, at 372 n. If so, they could then be exempted from jury service only on a case-by-case basis, and would join others with skills much less in demand whiling away their time in jury rooms of countless courthouses.
No one but a lawyer could think that this was a managerially sound solution to an important problem of judicial administration, and no one but a lawyer thoroughly steeped in the teachings of cases such as Taylor, Goldfarb, and Craig could think that such a solution was mandated by the United States Constitution. No large group of people can be conscripted to serve on juries nationwide, any more than in armies, without the use of broad general classifications which may not fit in every case the purpose for which the classification was designed. The alternative is case-by-case treatment which entails administrative burdens out of all proportion to the end sought to be achieved.
The short of it is that the only winners in today's decision are those in the category of petitioner, now freed of his conviction of first-degree murder. They are freed not because of any demonstrable unfairness at any stage of their trials, but because of the Court's obsession that criminal venires represent a ""fair cross section"" of the community, whatever that may be. The losers are the remaining members of that communitymen and women seeking to do their duty as jurors and yet minimize the inconvenience that such service entails, judicial administrators striving to make *378 the criminal justice system function, and the citizenry in general seeking the incarceration of those convicted of serious crimes after a fair trial. I do not believe that the Fourteenth Amendment was intended or should be interpreted to produce such a quixotic result.
"
5571,Justice White,majority,False,Duren v. Missouri,,1979,2.0,"In Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522 (1975), this Court held that systematic exclusion of women during the jury-selection process, resulting in jury pools not ""reasonably *359 representative"" of the community, denies a criminal defendant his right, under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, to a petit jury selected from a fair cross section of the community.[1] Under the system invalidated in Taylor, a women could not serve on a jury unless she filed a written declaration of her willingness to do so.[2] As a result, although 53% of the persons eligible for jury service were women, less than 1% of the 1,800 persons whose names were drawn from the jury wheel during the year in which appellant Taylor's jury was chosen were female. Id., at 524.
At the time of our decision in Taylor, no other State provided that women could not serve on a jury unless they volunteered to serve.[3] However, five States, including Missouri, provided an automatic exemption from jury service for any women requesting not to serve.[4] Subsequent to Taylor, *360 three of these States eliminated this exemption.[5] Only Missouri, respondent in this case, and Tennessee[6] continue to exempt women from jury service upon request.[7] Today we hold that such systematic exclusion of women that results in jury venires averaging less than 15% female violates the Constitution's fair-cross-section requirement.

I
Petitioner Duren was indicted in 1975 in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Mo., for first-degree murder and first-degree robbery. In a pretrial motion to quash his petit jury panel, and again in a post-conviction motion for a new trial, he contended that his right to trial by a jury chosen from a fair cross section of his community was denied by provisions of Missouri law granting women who so request an automatic exemption from jury service.[8] Both motions were denied.
*361 At hearings on these motions, petitioner established that the jury-selection process in Jackson County begins with the annual mailing of a questionnaire to persons randomly selected from the Jackson County voter registration list. Approximately 70,000 questionnaires were mailed in 1975. The questionnaire contains a list of occupations and other categories which are the basis under Missouri law for either disqualification[9] or exemption[10] from jury service.[11] Included on the questionnaire is a paragraph prominently addressed ""TO WOMEN"" that states in part:
""Any woman who elects not to serve will fill out this paragraph and mail this questionnaire to the jury commissioner at once.""[12]
*362 A similar paragraph is addressed ""TO MEN OVER 65 YEARS OF AGE,"" who are also statutorily exempt upon request.[13]
The names of those sent questionnaires are placed in the master jury wheel for Jackson County, except for those returning the questionnaire who indicate disqualification or claim an applicable exemption. Summonses are mailed on a weekly basis to prospective jurors randomly drawn from the jury wheel. The summons, like the questionnaire, contains special directions to men over 65 and to women, this time advising them to return the summons by mail if they desire not to serve. The practice also is that even those women who do not return the summons are treated as having claimed exemption if they fail to appear for jury service on the appointed day.[14] Other persons seeking to claim an exemption at this stage must make written or personal application to the court.
Petitioner established that according to the 1970 census, 54% of the adult inhabitants of Jackson County were women. He also showed that for the periods June-October 1975 and January-March 1976,[15] 11, 197 persons were summoned and that 2,992 of these, or 26.7%, were women. Of those summoned, 741 women and 4,378 men appeared for service. Thus, 14.5% (741 of 5,119) of the persons on the postsummons weekly venires during the period in which petitioner's jury was chosen were female.[16] In March 1976, when petitioner's *363 trial began, 15.5% of those on the weekly venires were women (110 of 707).[17] Petitioner's jury was selected from a 53-person panel on which there were 5 women; all 12 jurors chosen were men.[18] None of the foregoing statistical evidence was disputed.
In affirming petitioner's conviction, the Missouri Supreme Court questioned two aspects of his statistical presentation. First, it considered the census figures inadequate because they were six years old and might not precisely mirror the percentage of women registered to vote. Second, petitioner had not unequivocally demonstrated the extent to which the low percentage of women appearing for jury service was due to the automatic exemption for women, rather than to sex-neutral exemptions such as that for persons over age 65.
The court went on to hold, however, that even accepting petitioner's statistical proof, ""the number of female names in the wheel, those summoned and those appearing were well above acceptable constitutional standards."" 556 S.W.2d 11, 15-17 (1977).[19] We granted certiorari, 435 U.S. 1006 (1978), because of concern that the decision below is not consistent with our decision in Taylor.

II
We think that in certain crucial respects the Missouri Supreme Court misconceived the nature of the fair-cross-section inquiry set forth in Taylor. In holding that ""petit juries must be drawn from a source fairly representative of the community,"" 419 U.S., at 538, we explained that
""jury wheels, pools of names, panels, or venires from which juries are drawn must not systematically exclude *364 distinctive groups in the community and thereby fail to be reasonably representative thereof."" Ibid.[20]
In order to establish a prima facie violation of the fair-cross-section requirement, the defendant must show (1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a ""distinctive"" group in the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.

A
With respect to the first part of the prima facie test, Taylor without doubt established that women ""are sufficiently numerous and distinct from men"" so that ""if they are systematically eliminated from jury panels, the Sixth Amendment's fair-cross-section requirement cannot be satisfied."" Id., at 531.

B
The second prong of the prima facie case was established by petitioner's statistical presentation. Initially, the defendant must demonstrate the percentage of the community made up of the group alleged to be underrepresented, for this is the conceptual benchmark for the Sixth Amendment fair-cross-section requirement. In Taylor, the State had stipulated that 53% of the population eligible for jury service[21] was female, while petitioner Duren has relied upon a census *365 measurement of the actual percentage of women in the community (54%). In the trial court, the State of Missouri never challenged these data. Although the Missouri Supreme Court speculated that changing population patterns between 1970 and 1976 and unequal voter registration by men and women[22] rendered the census figures a questionable frame of reference,[23] there is no evidence whatsoever in the record to suggest that the 1970 census data significantly distorted the percentage of women in Jackson County at the time of trial. Petitioner's presentation was clearly adequate prima facie evidence of population characteristics for the purpose of making a fair-cross-section violation.[24]
Given petitioner's proof that in the relevant community slightly over half of the adults are women, we must disagree with the conclusion of the court below that jury venires containing approximately 15% women are ""reasonably representative"" *366 of this community. If the percentage of women appearing on jury pools in Jackson County had precisely mirrored the percentage of women in the population, more than one of every two prospective jurors would have been female. In fact, less than one of every six prospective jurors was female; 85% of the average jury was male. Such a gross discrepancy between the percentage of women in jury venires and the percentage of women in the community requires the conclusion that women were not fairly represented in the source from which petit juries were drawn in Jackson County.

C
Finally, in order to establish a prima facie case, it was necessary for petitioner to show that the underrepresentation of women, generally and on his venire, was due to their systematic exclusion in the jury-selection process. Petitioner's proof met this requirement. His undisputed demonstration that a large discrepancy occurred not just occasionally, but in every weekly venire for a period of nearly a year manifestly indicates that the cause of the underrepresentation was systematic that is, inherent in the particular jury-selection process utilized.
Petitioner Duren's statistics and other evidence also established when in the selection process the systematic exclusion took place. There was no indication that underrepresentation of women occurred at the first stage of the selection process the questionnaire canvass of persons randomly selected from the relevant voter registration list. The first sign of a systematic discrepancy is at the next stagethe construction of the jury wheel from which persons are randomly summoned for service. Less than 30% of those summoned were female, demonstrating that a substantially larger number of women answering the questionnaire claimed either ineligibility or exemption from jury service. Moreover, at the summons stage women were not only given another opportunity to *367 claim exemption, but also were presumed to have claimed exemption when they did not respond to the summons. Thus, the percentage of women at the final, venire, stage (14.5%) was much lower than the percentage of women who were summoned for service (26.7%).
The resulting disproportionate and consistent exclusion of women from the jury wheel and at the venire stage was quite obviously due to the system by which juries were selected. Petitioner demonstrated that the underrepresentation of women in the final pool of prospective jurors was due to the operation of Missouri's exemption criteriawhether the automatic exemption for women or other statutory exemptionsas implemented in Jackson County. Women were therefore systematically underrepresented within the meaning of Taylor.[25]

III
The demonstration of a prima facie fair-cross-section violation by the defendant is not the end of the inquiry into whether a constitutional violation has occurred. We have explained that ""States remain free to prescribe relevant qualifications for their jurors and to provide reasonable exemptions so long as it may be fairly said that the jury lists or panels are representative of the community."" Taylor, 419 U. S., at 538. However, we cautioned that ""[t]he right to a proper jury cannot be overcome on merely rational grounds,"" id., at 534. Rather, it requires that a significant state interest be manifestly and primarily advanced by those aspects of the *368 jury-selection process, such as exemption criteria, that result in the disproportionate exclusion of a distinctive group.[26]
The Supreme Court of Missouri suggested that the low percentage of women on jury venires in Jackson County may have been due to a greater number of women than of men qualifying for or claiming permissible exemptions, such as those for persons over 65, teachers, and government workers. 556 S.W.2d, at 16. Respondent further argues that petitioner has not proved that the exemption for women had ""any effect"" on or was responsible for the underrepresentation of women on venires. Brief for Respondent 15.
However, once the defendant has made a prima facie showing of an infringement of his constitutional right to a jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community, it is the State that bears the burden of justifying this infringement by showing attainment of a fair cross section to be incompatible with a significant state interest. See Taylor, 419 U. S., at 533-535. Assuming, arguendo, that the exemptions mentioned *369 by the court below would justify failure to achieve a fair community cross section on jury venires, the State must demonstrate that these exemptions caused the underrepresentation complained of. The record contains no such proof, and mere suggestions or assertions to that effect are insufficient.
The other possible cause of the disproportionate exclusion of women on Jackson County jury venires is, of course, the automatic exemption for women. Neither the Missouri Supreme Court nor respondent in its brief has offered any substantial justification for this exemption. In response to questioning at oral argument, counsel for respondent ventured that the only state interest advanced by the exemption is safeguarding the important role played by women in home and family life.[27] But exempting all women because of the preclusive domestic responsibilities of some women is insufficient justification for their disproportionate exclusion on jury venires. What we stated in Taylor with respect to the system there challenged under which women could ""opt in"" for jury service is equally applicable to Missouri's ""opt out"" exemption:
""It is untenable to suggest these days that it would be a special hardship for each and every woman to perform jury service or that society cannot spare any women from their present duties. This may be the case with many, and it may be burdensome to sort out those who should be exempted from those who should serve. But that task is performed in the case of men, and the administrative convenience in dealing with women as a class is insufficient justification for diluting the quality of community judgment represented by the jury in criminal trials.
.....
""If it was ever the case that women were unqualified to sit on juries or were so situated that none of them should be required to perform jury service, that time has long *370 since passed."" 419 U.S., at 534-535, 537 (footnote omitted).
We recognize that a State may have an important interest in assuring that those members of the family responsible for the care of children are available to do so. An exemption appropriately tailored to this interest would, we think, survive a fair-cross-section challenge. We stress, however, that the constitutional guarantee to a jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community requires that States exercise proper caution in exempting broad categories of persons from jury service. Although most occupational and other reasonable exemptions may inevitably involve some degree of overinclusiveness or underinclusiveness, any category expressly limited to a group in the community of sufficient magnitude and distinctiveness so as to be within the fair-cross-section requirement such as womenruns the danger of resulting in underrepresentation sufficient to constitute a prima facie violation of that constitutional requirement. We also repeat the observation made in Taylor that it is unlikely that reasonable exemptions, such as those based on special hardship, incapacity, or community needs, ""would pose substantial threats that the remaining pool of jurors would not be representative of the community."" Id., at 534.
The judgment of the Missouri Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
So ordered.
MR."
32722,Justice Powell,dissenting,False,Orr v. Orr,,1979,2.0,"I agree with MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST that the Court, in its desire to reach the equal protection issue in this case, has dealt too casually with the difficult Art. III problems which confront us. Rather than assume the answer to questions of state law on which the resolution of the Art. III issue should depend, and which well may moot the equal protection question in this case, I would abstain from reaching either of the constitutional questions at the present time.
This Court repeatedly has observed:
""[W]hen a federal constitutional claim is premised on an unsettled question of state law, the federal court should stay its hand in order to provide the state courts an opportunity to settle the underlying state-law question and thus avoid the possibility of unnecessarily deciding a constitutional question."" Harris County Comm'rs Court v. Moore, 420 U.S. 77, 83 (1975).
See Elkins v. Moreno, 435 U.S. 647 (1978); Boehning v. Indiana State Employees Assn., Inc., 423 U.S. 6 (1975); Askew v. Hargrave, 401 U.S. 476 (1971); Reetz v. Bozanich, *286 397 U.S. 82 (1970); Aldrich v. Aldrich, 378 U.S. 540 (1964); Dresner v. Tallahassee, 378 U.S. 539 (1964); Clay v. Sun Ins. Office Ltd., 363 U.S. 207 (1960); Meridian v. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 358 U.S. 639 (1959); Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. McLaughlin, 323 U.S. 101 (1944); Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496 (1941). The Court should follow this principle in the present case.
Here there are present two questions of state law, the resolution of which almost certainly will determine the outcome of this litigation, and at the least will substantially alter the issues presented. The Court concedes that Alabama properly might regard this challenge to the terms of the divorce decree as untimely, as it came for the first time more than two years after the decree became finalin a contempt proceeding to enforce the alimony obligation. Ante, at 275 n. 4. Moreover, appellant had interposed no objection to the entry of the decree and the approval therein of the settlement agreement, nor had he questioned the validity of the Alabama statute. If, in these circumstances, provisions of a divorce decree are subject to collateral attack, grave questions will arise in Alabama and other States. It hardly need be said that the policy of repose embodied in a prohibition of collateral attack has especial importance with respect to divorce and alimony decrees. It is not surprising, therefore, that subsequent to its decision in this case the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals held that a claim identical to appellant's would not be considered, where the husband raised it for the first time on a motion for a new trial. Hughes v. Hughes, 362 So. 2d 910, cert. dismissed as improvidently granted, 362 So. 2d 918 (Ala. 1978), appeal docketed, No. 78-1071. This holding should apply a fortiori to a case where the constitutional claim was not raised until a contempt proceeding.
The second question of state law concerns the formal settlement agreement entered into between appellant and appellee, which deals in detail with the ""property rights, alimony, and *287 other matters in dispute"" between the parties, and which was approved by the divorce court. The agreement requires the husband to pay $1,240 per month for the ""support and maintenance, use and comfort"" of the wife for her life or until she remarries. It also specifies that the terms and provisions of the agreement ""shall inure to and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs, assigns, executors, administrators and legal representatives."" App. 7-15. Although the Court does not view this agreement as any obstacle to reaching the constitutional question, it does acknowledge that appellant ""may have a continuing obligation to his former wife based upon that agreement""as a matter of ""state contract law"" quite apart from the divorce decree. Ante, at 275.
If appellant's collateral attack on the terms of the divorce decree could not properly be entertained under Alabama law, or if the alimony obligation assumed by appellant in the settlement agreement remains enforceable under Alabama law, the question whether this Court constitutionally may exercise jurisdiction over the dispute would be close and difficult.[1] In addition, it would be unnecessary to consider the constitutionality of Alabama's divorce statute, as the adequate-and-independent-state-ground doctrine then would bar federal review of the judgment against appellant.[2]
*288 The Court, in order to find a case or controversy present here, necessarily assumes the answer to both of the state-law questions in this case. In some circumstances such assumptions might be appropriate. We cannot anticipate every state-law issue that ultimately could bar the realization of an otherwise substantial federal claim, and the failure of either the state courts or the parties to address an issue ordinarily might indicate that it does not present a problem. But here the Court concedes the substantiality of the identified but unanswered questions. Indeed, in light of Hughes v. Hughes, supra, it could not do otherwise.
The uncertainty and ambiguity surrounding this case is accentuated by the fact that appellant apparently does not contend that the entire divorce decree is invalid; he seeks relief only from so much of the decree as imposes an alimony obligation. But this obligation is only one element of the detailed and comprehensive agreement signed by the parties and witnessed by their respective attorneys. The agreement was not made subject to the approval of the divorce court. Apart from whether the contractual obligation to pay alimony remains binding on appellant, is there a question as to the binding effect of the divorce itself upon appellee? Would she have agreed to divorce appellant without a contest, and without making a record of her grounds for divorce, unless she had the assurance of a valid and enforceable court order providing support and maintenance for her lifetime?
Apparently none of these questions was raised in either of the Alabama courts. No explanation has been offered us as to why the case is presented here in this manner.[3] In view of *289 the substantiality of the unanswered questions, it must be conceded that serious doubts exist as to either the presence of a judicially cognizable case or controversy or to appellant's obtaining any advantage from his constitutional claim. The failure of the parties to raise the questions in the courts below, and of the courts to raise them sua sponte, cannot bind us. On the record before us it cannot be said with assurance that the interests of these parties before this Court are fully adversary or that they are not seekingfor reasons undiscloseda purely advisory opinion on a constitutional issue of considerable importance.[4]
In these circumstances, I find the Court's insistence upon reaching and deciding the merits quite irreconcilable with the long-established doctrine that we abstain from reaching a federal constitutional claim that is premised on unsettled questions of state law without first affording the state courts *290 an opportunity to resolve such questions. I therefore would remand the case to the Supreme Court of Alabama.
MR."
32720,Justice Brennan,majority,False,Orr v. Orr,,1979,2.0,"The question presented is the constitutionality of Alabama alimony statutes which provide that husbands, but not wives, may be required to pay alimony upon divorce.[1]
On February 26, 1974, a final decree of divorce was entered, dissolving the marriage of William and Lillian Orr. That decree directed appellant, Mr. Orr, to pay appellee, Mrs. Orr, $1,240 per month in alimony. On July 28, 1976, Mrs. Orr *271 initiated a contempt proceeding in the Circuit Court of Lee County, Ala., alleging that Mr. Orr was in arrears in his alimony payments. On August 19, 1976, at the hearing on Mrs. Orr's petition, Mr. Orr submitted in his defense a motion requesting that Alabama's alimony statutes be declared unconstitutional because they authorize courts to place an obligation of alimony upon husbands but never upon wives. The Circuit Court denied Mr. Orr's motion and entered judgment against him for $5,524, covering back alimony and attorney fees. Relying solely upon his federal constitutional claim, Mr. Orr appealed the judgment. On March 16, 1977, the Court of Civil Appeals of Alabama sustained the constitutionality of the Alabama statutes, 351 So. 2d 904. On May 24, the Supreme Court of Alabama granted Mr. Orr's petition for a writ of certiorari, but on November 10, without court opinion, quashed the writ as improvidently granted. 351 So. 2d 906. We noted probable jurisdiction, 436 U.S. 924 (1978). We now hold the challenged Alabama statutes unconstitutional and reverse.

I
We first address three preliminary questions not raised by the parties or the Alabama courts below, but which nevertheless may be jurisdictional and therefore are considered of our own motion.
The first concerns the standing of Mr. Orr to assert in his defense the unconstitutionality of the Alabama statutes. It appears that Mr. Orr made no claim that he was entitled to an award of alimony from Mrs. Orr, but only that he should not be required to pay alimony if similarly situated wives could not be ordered to pay.[2] It is therefore possible that his *272 success here will not ultimately bring him relief from the judgment outstanding against him, as the State could respond to a reversal by neutrally extending alimony rights to needy husbands as well as wives. In that event, Mr. Orr would remain obligated to his wife. It is thus argued that the only ""proper plaintiff"" would be a husband who requested alimony for himself, and not one who merely objected to paying alimony.
This argument quite clearly proves too much. In every equal protection attack upon a statute challenged as underinclusive, the State may satisfy the Constitution's commands either by extending benefits to the previously disfavored class or by denying benefits to both parties (e. g., by repealing the statute as a whole). In this case, if held unconstitutional, the Alabama divorce statutes could be validated by, inter alia, amendments which either (1) permit awards to husbands as well as wives, or (2) deny alimony to both parties. It is true that under the first disposition Mr. Orr might gain nothing from his success in this Court, although the hypothetical ""requesting"" plaintiff would. However, if instead the State takes the second course and denies alimony to both spouses, it is Mr. Orr and not the hypothetical plaintiff who would benefit. Because we have no way of knowing how the State will in fact respond, unless we are to hold that underinclusive statutes can never be challenged because any plaintiff's success can theoretically be thwarted, Mr. Orr must be held to have standing here. We have on several occasions considered this inherent problem of challenges to underinclusive statutes, Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U.S. 7, 17 (1975); Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 210 n. 24 (1976), and have not denied a plaintiff standing on this ground.
*273 There is no question but that Mr. Orr bears a burden he would not bear were he female. The issue is highlighted, although not altered, by transposing it to the sphere of race. There is no doubt that a state law imposing alimony obligations on blacks but not whites could be challenged by a black who was required to pay. The burden alone is sufficient to establish standing. Our resolution of a statute's constitutionality often does ""not finally resolve the controversy as between th[e] appellant and th[e] appellee,"" Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S., at 17. We do not deny standing simply because the ""appellant, although prevailing here on the federal constitutional issue, may or may not ultimately win [his] lawsuit."" Id., at 18. The holdings of the Alabama courts stand as a total bar to appellant's relief; his constitutional attack holds the only promise of escape from the burden that derives from the challenged statutes. He has therefore ""alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which th[is] court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions,"" Linda R. S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 616 (1973), quoting Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962). Indeed, on indistinguishable facts, this Court has stated that a party's standing will be sustained. In Linda R. S. v. Richard D., supra, at 619 n. 5 (MARSHALL, J.), we stated that the parent of a legitimate child who must by statute pay child support has standing to challenge the statute on the ground that the parent of an illegitimate child is not equally burdened.[3]
*274 A second preliminary question concerns the timeliness of appellant's challenge to the constitutionality of the statutes. No constitutional challenge was made at the time of the original divorce decree; Mr. Orr did not interpose the Constitution until his ex-wife sought a contempt judgment against him for his failure to abide by the terms of the decree. This unexcused tardiness might well have constituted a procedural default under state law, and if Alabama had refused to hear Mr. Orr's constitutional objection on that ground, we might have been without jurisdiction to consider it here. See C. Wright, Federal Courts 541-542 (3d ed. 1976).
But in this case neither Mrs. Orr nor the Alabama courts at any time objected to the timeliness of the presentation of the constitutional issue. Instead, the Alabama Circuit and Civil Appeals Courts both considered the issue to be properly presented and decided it on the merits. See 351 So. 2d, at 905; App. to Juris. Statement 22a. In such circumstances, the objection that Mr. Orr's complaint "" `comes too late' . . . is clearly untenable. . . . [S]ince the state court deemed the federal constitutional question to be before it, we could not treat the decision below as resting upon an adequate and independent state ground even if we were to conclude that the state court might properly have relied upon such a ground to avoid deciding the federal question."" Beecher v. Alabama, 389 U.S. 35, 37 n. 3 (1967). This is merely an application of the ""elementary rule that it is irrelevant to inquire . . . when a Federal question was raised in a court *275 below when it appears that such question was actually considered and decided."" Manhattan Life Ins. Co. v. Cohen, 234 U.S. 123, 134 (1914). Accord, Harlin v. Missouri, 439 U.S. 459 (1979); Jenkins v. Georgia, 418 U.S. 153, 157 (1974); Raley v. Ohio, 360 U.S. 423, 436 (1959). See C. Wright, supra, at 542.[4]
The third preliminary question arises from indications in the record that Mr. Orr's alimony obligation was part of a stipulation entered into by the parties, which was then incorporated into the divorce decree by the Lee County Circuit Court. Thus, it may be that despite the unconstitutionality of the alimony statutes, Mr. Orr may have a continuing obligation to his former wife based upon that agreementin essence a matter of state contract law.[5] If the Alabama *276 courts had so held, and had anchored their judgments in this case on that basis, an independent and adequate state ground might exist and we would be without power to hear the constitutional argument. See Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U.S. 117, 125-126 (1945); Fox Film Corp. v. Muller, 296 U.S. 207 (1935). And if there were ambiguity as to whether the State's decision was based on federal or state grounds, it would be open to this Court not to determine the federal question, but to remand to the state courts for clarification as to the ground of the decision. See California v. Krivda, 409 U.S. 33 (1972).
But there is no ambiguity here. At no time did Mrs. Orr raise the stipulation as a possible alternative ground in support of her judgment. Indeed, her brief in the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals expressly stated that ""[t]he appellee agrees that the issue before this Court is whether the Alabama alimony laws are unconstitutional because of the gender based classification made in the statutes."" App. to Juris. Statement 25a. The Alabama Circuit and Civil Appeals Courts reached and decided the federal question without considering any state-law issues, the latter specifying that ""[t]he sole issue before this court is whether Alabama's alimony statutes are unconstitutional. We find they are not unconstitutional and affirm."" 351 So. 2d, at 905. While no reason was given by the State Supreme Court's majority for quashing the writ of certiorari, the concurring and dissenting opinions mention only the federal constitutional issue and do not mention the stipulation. See 351 So. 2d, at 906-910. And Mrs. Orr did not even raise the point in this Court. On this record, then, our course is clear and dictated by a long line of decisions.
""Where the state court does not decide against a petitioner or appellant upon an independent state ground, but deeming the federal question to be before it, actually *277 entertains and decides that question adversely to the federal right asserted, this Court has jurisdiction to review the judgment if, as here, it is a final judgment. We cannot refuse jurisdiction because the state court might have based its decision, consistently with the record, upon an independent and adequate non-federal ground."" Indiana ex rel. Anderson v. Brand, 303 U.S. 95, 98 (1938).
Accord, United Air Lines, Inc. v. Mahin, 410 U.S. 623, 630-631 (1973); Poafpybitty v. Skelly Oil Co., 390 U.S. 365, 375-376 (1968); Steele v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 323 U.S. 192, 197 n. 1 (1944); International Steel & Iron Co. v. National Surety Co., 297 U.S. 657, 666 (1936); Grayson v. Harris, 267 U.S. 352, 358 (1925); Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., 264 U.S. 109, 120 (1924); Rogers v. Hennepin County, 240 U.S. 184, 188-189 (1916). See C. Wright, Federal Courts, at 544.[6]
Our analysis of these three preliminary questions, therefore, indicates that we do have jurisdiction over the constitutional challenge asserted by Mr. Orr.[7] As an Art. III ""case or *278 controversy"" has been properly presented to this Court, we now turn to the merits.[8]

II
In authorizing the imposition of alimony obligations on husbands, but not on wives, the Alabama statutory scheme ""provides that different treatment be accorded . . . on the basis of . . . sex; it thus establishes a classification subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause,"" Reed v. *279 Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 75 (1971). The fact that the classification expressly discriminates against men rather than women does not protect it from scrutiny. Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976). ""To withstand scrutiny"" under the Equal Protection Clause, "" `classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.' "" Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313, 316-317 (1977). We shall, therefore, examine the three governmental objectives that might arguably be served by Alabama's statutory scheme.
Appellant views the Alabama alimony statutes as effectively announcing the State's preference for an allocation of family responsibilities under which the wife plays a dependent role, and as seeking for their objective the reinforcement of that model among the State's citizens. Cf. Stern v. Stern, 165 Conn. 190, 332 A.2d 78 (1973). We agree, as he urges, that prior cases settle that this purpose cannot sustain the statutes.[9]Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U.S. 7, 10 (1975), held that the ""old notio[n]"" that ""generally it is the man's primary responsibility *280 to provide a home and its essentials,"" can no longer justify a statute that discriminates on the basis of gender. ""No longer is the female destined solely for the home and the rearing of the family, and only the male for the marketplace and the world of ideas,"" id., at 14-15. See also Craig v. Boren, supra, at 198. If the statute is to survive constitutional attack, therefore, it must be validated on some other basis.
The opinion of the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals suggests other purposes that the statute may serve. Its opinion states that the Alabama statutes were ""designed"" for ""the wife of a broken marriage who needs financial assistance,"" 351 So. 2d, at 905. This may be read as asserting either of two legislative objectives. One is a legislative purpose to provide help for needy spouses, using sex as a proxy for need. The other is a goal of compensating women for past discrimination during marriage, which assertedly has left them unprepared to fend for themselves in the working world following divorce. We concede, of course, that assisting needy spouses is a legitimate and important governmental objective. We have also recognized ""[r]education of the disparity in economic condition between men and women caused by the long history of discrimination against women . . . as . . . an important governmental objective,"" Califano v. Webster, supra, at 317. It only remains, therefore, to determine whether the classification at issue here is ""substantially related to achievement of those objectives."" Ibid.[10]
Ordinarily, we would begin the analysis of the ""needy spouse"" objective by considering whether sex is a sufficiently ""accurate proxy,"" Craig v. Boren, supra, at 204, for dependency to establish that the gender classification rests "" `upon *281 some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation,' "" Reed v. Reed, supra, at 76. Similarly, we would initially approach the ""compensation"" rationale by asking whether women had in fact been significantly discriminated against in the sphere to which the statute applied a sex-based classification, leaving the sexes ""not similarly situated with respect to opportunities"" in that sphere, Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U.S. 498, 508 (1975). Compare Califano v. Webster, supra, at 318, and Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U.S. 351, 353 (1974), with Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 648 (1975).[11]
But in this case, even if sex were a reliable proxy for need, and even if the institution of marriage did discriminate against women, these factors still would ""not adequately justify the salient features of"" Alabama's statutory scheme, Craig v. Boren, supra, at 202-203. Under the statute, individualized hearings at which the parties' relative financial circumstances are considered already occur. See Russell v. Russell, 247 Ala. 284, 286, 24 So. 2d 124, 126 (1945); Ortman v. Ortman, 203 Ala. 167, 82 So. 417 (1919). There is no reason, therefore, to use sex as a proxy for need. Needy males could be helped along with needy females with little if any additional burden on the State. In such circumstances, not even an administrative-convenience rationale exists to justify operating by generalization or proxy.[12] Similarly, since individualized hearings can *282 determine which women were in fact discriminated against vis-a-vis their husbands, as well as which family units defied the stereotype and left the husband dependent on the wife, Alabama's alleged compensatory purpose may be effectuated without placing burdens solely on husbands. Progress toward fulfilling such a purpose would not be hampered, and it would cost the State nothing more, if it were to treat men and women equally by making alimony burdens independent of sex. ""Thus, the gender-based distinction is gratuitous; without it, the statutory scheme would only provide benefits to those men who are in fact similarly situated to the women the statute aids,"" Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, supra, at 653, and the effort to help those women would not in any way be compromised.
Moreover, use of a gender classification actually produces perverse results in this case. As compared to a gender-neutral law placing alimony obligations on the spouse able to pay, the present Alabama statutes give an advantage only to the financially secure wife whose husband is in need. Although such a wife might have to pay alimony under a gender-neutral statute, the present statutes exempt her from that obligation. Thus, ""[t]he [wives] who benefit from the disparate treatment are those who were . . . nondependent on their husbands,"" Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199, 221 (1977) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). They are precisely those who are not ""needy spouses"" and who are ""least likely to have been victims of . . . discrimination,"" ibid., by the institution of marriage. A gender-based classification which, as compared to a *283 gender-neutral one, generates additional benefits only for those it has no reason to prefer cannot survive equal protection scrutiny.
Legislative classifications which distribute benefits and burdens on the basis of gender carry the inherent risk of reinforcing stereotypes about the ""proper place"" of women and their need for special protection. Cf. United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, 173-174 (1977) (opinion concurring in part). Thus, even statutes purportedly designed to compensate for and ameliorate the effects of past discrimination must be carefully tailored. Where, as here, the State's compensatory and ameliorative purposes are as well served by a gender-neutral classification as one that gender classifies and therefore carries with it the baggage of sexual stereotypes, the State cannot be permitted to classify on the basis of sex. And this is doubly so where the choice made by the State appears to redoundif only indirectlyto the benefit of those without need for special solicitude.

III
Having found Alabama's alimony statutes unconstitutional, we reverse the judgment below and remand the cause for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. That disposition, of course, leaves the state courts free to decide any questions of substantive state law not yet passed upon in this litigation. Indiana ex rel. Anderson v. Brand, 303 U.S. 95, 109 (1938); C. Wright, Federal Courts, at 544. See South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U.S. 364, 396 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting); United Air Lines, Inc. v. Mahin, 410 U. S., at 632; California v. Green, 399 U.S. 149, 169-170 (1970); Schuylkill Trust Co. v. Pennsylvania, 302 U.S. 506, 512 (1938); Georgia R. & Elec. Co. v. Decatur, 297 U.S. 620, 623-624 (1936). Therefore, it is open to the Alabama courts on remand to consider whether Mr. Orr's stipulated agreement to *284 pay alimony, or other grounds of gender-neutral state law, bind him to continue his alimony payments.[13]
Reversed and remanded.
MR."
11834,Justice Brennan,dissenting,False,Harris v. McRae,,1980,1.0,"[*]
I agree entirely with my Brother STEVENS that the State's interest in protecting the potential life of the fetus cannot justify the exclusion of financially and medically needy women from the benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled solely because the treatment that a doctor has concluded is medically necessary involves an abortion. See post, at 351-352. I write separately to express my continuing disagreement[1] with the Court's mischaracterization of the nature of the fundamental right recognized in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and its misconception of the manner in which that right is infringed by federal and state legislation withdrawing all funding for medically necessary abortions.
Roe v. Wade held that the constitutional right to personal privacy encompasses a woman's decision whether or not to *330 terminate her pregnancy. Roe and its progeny[2] established that the pregnant woman has a right to be free from state interference with her choice to have an abortiona right which, at least prior to the end of the first trimester, absolutely prohibits any governmental regulation of that highly personal decision.[3] The proposition for which these cases stand thus is not that the State is under an affirmative obligation to ensure access to abortions for all who may desire them; it is that the State must refrain from wielding its enormous power and influence in a manner that might burden the pregnant woman's freedom to choose whether to have an abortion. The Hyde Amendment's denial of public funds for medically necessary abortions plainly intrudes upon this constitutionally protected decision, for both by design and in effect it serves to coerce indigent pregnant women to bear children that they would otherwise elect not to have.[4]
*331 When viewed in the context of the Medicaid program to which it is appended, it is obvious that the Hyde Amendment is nothing less than an attempt by Congress to circumvent the dictates of the Constitution and achieve indirectly what Roe v. Wade said it could not do directly.[5] Under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, the Federal Government reimburses participating States for virtually all medically necessary services it provides to the categorically needy. The sole limitation of any significance is the Hyde Amendment's prohibition against the use of any federal funds to pay for the *332 costs of abortions (except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term). As my Brother STEVENS persuasively demonstrates, exclusion of medically necessary abortions from Medicaid coverage cannot be justified as a cost-saving device. Rather, the Hyde Amendment is a transparent attempt by the Legislative Branch to impose the political majority's judgment of the morally acceptable and socially desirable preference on a sensitive and intimate decision that the Constitution entrusts to the individual. Worse yet, the Hyde Amendment does not foist that majoritarian viewpoint with equal measure upon everyone in our Nation, rich and poor alike; rather, it imposes that viewpoint only upon that segment of our society which, because of its position of political powerlessness, is least able to defend its privacy rights from the encroachments of state-mandated morality. The instant legislation thus calls for more exacting judicial review than in most other cases. ""When elected leaders cower before public pressure, this Court, more than ever, must not shirk its duty to enforce the Constitution for the benefit of the poor and powerless."" Beal v. Doe, 432 U.S. 438, 462 (1977) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). Though it may not be this Court's mission ""to decide whether the balance of competing interests reflected in the Hyde Amendment is wise social policy,"" ante, at 326, it most assuredly is our responsibility to vindicate the pregnant woman's constitutional right to decide whether to bear children free from governmental intrusion.
Moreover, it is clear that the Hyde Amendment not only was designed to inhibit, but does in fact inhibit the woman's freedom to choose abortion over childbirth. ""Pregnancy is unquestionably a condition requiring medical services. . . . Treatment for the condition may involve medical procedures for its termination, or medical procedures to bring the pregnancy to term, resulting in a live birth. `[A]bortion and childbirth, when stripped of the sensitive moral arguments surrounding the abortion controversy, are simply two alternative *333 medical methods of dealing with pregnancy. . . .'"" Beal v. Doe, supra, at 449 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting) (quoting Roe v. Norton, 408 F. Supp. 660, 663, n. 3 (Conn. 1975)). In every pregnancy, one of these two courses of treatment is medically necessary, and the poverty-stricken woman depends on the Medicaid Act to pay for the expenses associated with that procedure. But under the Hyde Amendment, the Government will fund only those procedures incidental to childbirth. By thus injecting coercive financial incentives favoring childbirth into a decision that is constitutionally guaranteed to be free from governmental intrusion, the Hyde Amendment deprives the indigent woman of her freedom to choose abortion over maternity, thereby impinging on the due process liberty right recognized in Roe v. Wade.
The Court's contrary conclusion is premised on its belief that ""[t]he financial constraints that restrict an indigent woman's ability to enjoy the full range of constitutionally protected freedom of choice are the product not of governmental restrictions on access to abortions, but rather of her indigency."" Ante, at 316. Accurate as this statement may be, it reveals only half the picture. For what the Court fails to appreciate is that it is not simply the woman's indigency that interferes with her freedom of choice, but the combination of her own poverty and the Government's unequal subsidization of abortion and childbirth.
A poor woman in the early stages of pregnancy confronts two alternatives: she may elect either to carry the fetus to term or to have an abortion. In the abstract, of course, this choice is hers alone, and the Court rightly observes that the Hyde Amendment ""places no governmental obstacle in the path of a woman who chooses to terminate her pregnancy."" Ante, at 315. But the reality of the situation is that the Hyde Amendment has effectively removed this choice from the indigent woman's hands. By funding all of the expenses associated with childbirth and none of the expenses incurred in terminating pregnancy, the Government literally makes an *334 offer that the indigent woman cannot afford to refuse. It matters not that in this instance the Government has used the carrot rather than the stick. What is critical is the realization that as a practical matter, many poverty-stricken woman will choose to carry their pregnancy to term simply because the Government provides funds for the associated medical services, even though these same women would have chosen to have an abortion if the Government had also paid for that option, or indeed if the Government had stayed out of the picture altogether and had defrayed the costs of neither procedure.
The fundamental flaw in the Court's due process analysis, then, is its failure to acknowledge that the discriminatory distribution of the benefits of governmental largesse can discourage the exercise of fundamental liberties just as effectively as can an outright denial of those rights through criminal and regulatory sanctions. Implicit in the Court's reasoning is the notion that as long as the Government is not obligated to provide its citizens with certain benefits or privileges, it may condition the grant of such benefits on the recipient's relinquishment of his constitutional rights.
It would belabor the obvious to expound at any great length on the illegitimacy of a state policy that interferes with the exercise of fundamental rights through the selective bestowal of governmental favors. It suffices to note that we have heretofore never hesitated to invalidate any scheme of granting or withholding financial benefits that incidentally or intentionally burdens one manner of exercising a constitutionally protected choice. To take but one example of many, Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963), involved a South Carolina unemployment insurance statute that required recipients to accept suitable employment when offered, even if the grounds for refusal stemmed from religious convictions. Even though the recipients possessed no entitlement to compensation, the Court held that the State could not cancel the *335 benefits of a Seventh-Day Adventist who had refused a job requiring her to work on Saturdays. The Court's explanation is particularly instructive for the present case:
""Here not only is it apparent that appellant's declared ineligibility for benefits derives solely from the practice of her religion, but the pressure upon her to forego that practice is unmistakable. The ruling forces her to choose between following the precepts of her religion and forfeiting benefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of the precepts of her religion in order to accept work, on the other hand. Governmental imposition of such a choice puts the same kind of burden upon the free exercise of religion as would a fine imposed against appellant for her Saturday worship.
""Nor may the South Carolina court's construction of the statute be saved from constitutional infirmity on the ground that unemployment compensation benefits are not appellant's `right' but merely a `privilege.' It is too late in the day to doubt that the liberties of religion and expression may be infringed by the denial of or placing of conditions upon a benefit or privilege. . . . [T]o condition the availability of benefits upon this appellant's willingness to violate a cardinal principle of her religious faith effectively penalizes the free exercise of her constitutional liberties."" Id., at 404-406.
See also Frost & Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad Comm'n, 271 U.S. 583 (1926); Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513 (1958); Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U.S. 11 (1966); Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970); U. S. Dept. of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528 (1973); Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546 (1975). Cf. Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618 (1969); Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, 415 U.S. 250 (1974).
The Medicaid program cannot be distinguished from these other statutory schemes that unconstitutionally burdened *336 fundamental rights.[6] Here, as in Sherbert, the government withholds financial benefits in a manner that discourages the exercise of a due process liberty: The indigent woman who chooses to assert her constitutional right to have an abortion can do so only on pain of sacrificing health-care benefits to which she would otherwise be entitled. Over 50 years ago, Mr. Justice Sutherland, writing for the Court in Frost & Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad Comm'n, supra, at 593-594, made the following observation, which is as true now as it was then:
""It would be a palpable incongruity to strike down an act of state legislation which, by words of express divestment, seeks to strip the citizen of rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution, but to uphold an act by *337 which the same result is accomplished under the guise of a surrender of a right in exchange for a valuable privilege which the state threatens otherwise to withhold. It is not necessary to challenge the proposition that, as a general rule, the state, having power to deny a privilege altogether, may grant it upon such conditions as it sees fit to impose. But the power of the state in that respect is not unlimited; and one of the limitations is that it may not impose conditions which require the relinquishment of constitutional rights. If the state may compel the surrender of one constitutional right as a condition of its favor, it may, in like manner, compel a surrender of all. It is inconceivable that guaranties embedded in the Constitution of the United States may thus be manipulated out of existence.""
I respectfully dissent.
MR."
11832,Justice Stewart,majority,False,Harris v. McRae,,1980,1.0,"This case presents statutory and constitutional questions concerning the public funding of abortions under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, commonly known as the ""Medicaid"" Act, and recent annual Appropriations Acts containing *301 the so-called ""Hyde Amendment."" The statutory question is whether Title XIX requires a State that participates in the Medicaid program to fund the cost of medically necessary abortions for which federal reimbursement is unavailable under the Hyde Amendment. The constitutional question, which arises only if Title XIX imposes no such requirement, is whether the Hyde Amendment, by denying public funding for certain medically necessary abortions, contravenes the liberty or equal protection guarantees of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, or either of the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment.

I
The Medicaid program was created in 1965, when Congress added Title XIX to the Social Security Act, 79 Stat. 343, as amended, 42 U.S. C. § 1396 et seq. (1976 ed. and Supp. II), for the purpose of providing federal financial assistance to States that choose to reimburse certain costs of medical treatment for needy persons. Although participation in the Medicaid program is entirely optional, once a State elects to participate, it must comply with the requirements of Title XIX.
One such requirement is that a participating State agree to provide financial assistance to the ""categorically needy""[1] with respect to five general areas of medical treatment: (1) inpatient hospital services, (2) outpatient hospital services, (3) other laboratory and X-ray services, (4) skilled nursing *302 facilities services, periodic screening and diagnosis of children, and family planning services, and (5) services of physicians. 42 U.S. C. §§ 1396a (a) (13) (B), 1396d (a) (1)-(5). Although a participating State need not ""provide funding for all medical treatment falling within the five general categories, [Title XIX] does require that [a] state Medicaid pla[n] establish `reasonable standards . . . for determining . . . the extent of medical assistance under the plan which . . . are consistent with the objectives of [Title XIX].' 42 U.S. C. § 1396a (a) (17)."" Beal v. Doe, 432 U.S. 438, 441.
Since September 1976, Congress has prohibitedeither by an amendment to the annual appropriations bill for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare[2] or by a joint resolutionthe use of any federal funds to reimburse the cost of abortions under the Medicaid program except under certain specified circumstances. This funding restriction is commonly known as the ""Hyde Amendment,"" after its original congressional sponsor, Representative Hyde. The current version of the Hyde Amendment, applicable for fiscal year 1980, provides:
""[N]one of the funds provided by this joint resolution shall be used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term; or except for such medical procedures necessary for the victims of rape or incest when such rape or incest has been reported promptly to a law enforcement agency or public health service."" Pub. L. 96-123, § 109, 93 Stat. 926.
See also Pub. L. 96-86, § 118, 93 Stat. 662. This version of the Hyde Amendment is broader than that applicable for fiscal year 1977, which did not include the ""rape or incest"" *303 exception, Pub. L. 94-439, § 209, 90 Stat. 1434, but narrower than that applicable for most of fiscal year 1978,[3] and all of fiscal year 1979, which had an additional exception for ""instances where severe and long-lasting physical health damage to the mother would result if the pregnancy were carried to term when so determined by two physicians,"" Pub. L. 95-205, § 101, 91 Stat. 1460; Pub. L. 95-480, § 210, 92 Stat. 1586.[4]
On September 30, 1976, the day on which Congress enacted the initial version of the Hyde Amendment, these consolidated cases were filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiffsCora McRae, a New York Medicaid recipient then in the first trimester of a pregnancy that she wished to terminate, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corp., a public benefit corporation that operates 16 hospitals, 12 of which provide abortion services, and otherssought to enjoin the enforcement of the funding restriction on abortions. They alleged that the Hyde Amendment violated the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amendments of the Constitution insofar as it limited the funding of abortions to those necessary to save the life of the mother, while permitting the funding of costs associated with childbirth. Although the sole named defendant was the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, the District Court permitted Senators James L. Buckley and Jesse A. Helms and Representative Henry J. Hyde to intervene as defendants.[5]
*304 After a hearing, the District Court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Secretary from enforcing the Hyde Amendment and requiring him to continue to provide federal reimbursement for abortions under the standards applicable before the funding restriction had been enacted. McRae v. Mathews, 421 F. Supp. 533. Although stating that it had not expressly held that the funding restriction was unconstitutional, since the preliminary injunction was not its final judgment, the District Court noted that such a holding was ""implicit"" in its decision granting the injunction. The District Court also certified the McRae case as a class action on behalf of all pregnant or potentially pregnant women in the State of New York eligible for Medicaid and who decide to have an abortion within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy, and of all authorized providers of abortion services to such women. Id., at 543.
The Secretary then brought an appeal to this Court. After deciding Beal v. Doe, 432 U.S. 438, and Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, we vacated the injunction of the District Court and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of those decisions. Califano v. McRae, 433 U.S. 916.
On remand, the District Court permitted the intervention of several additional plaintiffs, including (1) four individual Medicaid recipients who wished to have abortions that allegedly were medically necessary but did not qualify for federal funds under the versions of the Hyde Amendment applicable in fiscal years 1977 and 1978, (2) several physicians who perform abortions for Medicaid recipients, (3) the Women's Division of the Board of Global Ministries of the United Methodist Church (Women's Division), and (4) two individual officers of the Women's Division.
An amended complaint was then filed, challenging the various versions of the Hyde Amendment on several grounds. At the outset, the plaintiffs asserted that the District Court need not address the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment *305 because, in their view, a participating State remains obligated under Title XIX to fund all medically necessary abortions, even if federal reimbursement is unavailable. With regard to the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment, the plaintiffs asserted, among other things, that the funding restrictions violate the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
After a lengthy trial, which inquired into the medical reasons for abortions and the diverse religious views on the subject,[6] the District Court filed an opinion and entered a judgment invalidating all versions of the Hyde Amendment on constitutional grounds.[7] The District Court rejected the plaintiffs' statutory argument, concluding that even though Title XIX would otherwise have required a participating State to fund medically necessary abortions, the Hyde Amendment had substantively amended Title XIX to relieve a State of that funding obligation. Turning then to the constitutional issues, the District Court concluded that the Hyde Amendment, though valid under the Establishment Clause,[8] violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. With regard to the Fifth Amendment, the District Court noted that when an abortion is ""medically necessary to safeguard the pregnant woman's health, . . . the disentitlement to [M]edicaid assistance impinges directly on the woman's right to decide, in consultation with her physician and in reliance on his judgment, to terminate *306 her pregnancy in order to preserve her health.""[9]McRae v. Califano, 491 F. Supp. 630, 737. The court concluded that the Hyde Amendment violates the equal protection guarantee because, in its view, the decision of Congress to fund medically necessary services generally but only certain medically necessary abortions serves no legitimate governmental interest. As to the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, the court held that insofar as a woman's decision to seek a medically necessary abortion may be a product of her religious beliefs under certain Protestant and Jewish tenets, the funding restrictions of the Hyde Amendment violate that constitutional guarantee as well.
Accordingly, the District Court ordered the Secretary to ""[c]ease to give effect"" to the various versions of the Hyde Amendment insofar as they forbid payments for medically necessary abortions. It further directed the Secretary to ""[c]ontinue to authorize the expenditure of federal matching funds [for such abortions]."" App. 87. In addition, the court recertified the McRae case as a nationwide class action on behalf of all pregnant and potentially pregnant women eligible for Medicaid who wish to have medically necessary abortions, and of all authorized providers of abortions for such women.[10]
The Secretary then applied to this Court for a stay of the judgment pending direct appeal of the District Court's decision. We denied the stay, but noted probable jurisdiction of this appeal. 444 U.S. 1069.

II
It is well settled that if a case may be decided on either statutory or constitutional grounds, this Court, for sound *307 jurisprudential reasons, will inquire first into the statutory question. This practice reflects the deeply rooted doctrine ""that we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality. . . unless such adjudication is unavoidable."" Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. McLaughlin, 323 U.S. 101, 105. Accordingly, we turn first to the question whether Title XIX requires a State that participates in the Medicaid program to continue to fund those medically necessary abortions for which federal reimbursement is unavailable under the Hyde Amendment. If a participating State is under such an obligation, the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment need not be drawn into question in the present case, for the availability of medically necessary abortions under Medicaid would continue, with the participating State shouldering the total cost of funding such abortions.
The appellees assert that a participating State has an independent funding obligation under Title XIX because (1) the Hyde Amendment is, by its own terms, only a limitation on federal reimbursement for certain medically necessary abortions, and (2) Title XIX does not permit a participating State to exclude from its Medicaid plan any medically necessary service solely on the basis of diagnosis or condition, even if federal reimbursement is unavailable for that service.[11] It is thus the appellees' view that the effect of the Hyde Amendment is to withhold federal reimbursement for certain medically necessary abortions, but not to relieve a participating *308 State of its duty under Title XIX to provide for such abortions in its Medicaid plan.
The District Court rejected this argument. It concluded that, although Title XIX would otherwise have required a participating State to include medically necessary abortions in its Medicaid program, the Hyde Amendment substantively amended Title XIX so as to relieve a State of that obligation. This construction of the Hyde Amendment was said to find support in the decisions of two Courts of Appeals, Preterm, Inc. v. Dukakis, 591 F.2d 121 (CA1 1979), and Zbaraz v. Quern, 596 F.2d 196 (CA7 1979), and to be consistent with the understanding of the effect of the Hyde Amendment by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in the administration of the Medicaid program.
We agree with the District Court, but for somewhat different reasons. The Medicaid program created by Title XIX is a cooperative endeavor in which the Federal Government provides financial assistance to participating States to aid them in furnishing health care to needy persons. Under this system of ""cooperative federalism,"" King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309, 316, if a State agrees to establish a Medicaid plan that satisfies the requirements of Title XIX, which include several mandatory categories of health services, the Federal Government agrees to pay a specified percentage of ""the total amount expended . . . as medical assistance under the State plan. . . ."" 42 U.S. C. § 1396b (a) (1). The cornerstone of Medicaid is financial contribution by both the Federal Government and the participating State. Nothing in Title XIX as originally enacted, or in its legislative history, suggests that Congress intended to require a participating State to assume the full costs of providing any health services in its Medicaid plan. Quite the contrary, the purpose of Congress in enacting Title XIX was to provide federal financial assistance for all legitimate state expenditures under an approved Medicaid plan. See S. Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st *309 Sess., pt. 1, pp. 83-85 (1965); H. R. Rep. No. 213, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 72-74 (1965).
Since the Congress that enacted Title XIX did not intend a participating State to assume a unilateral funding obligation for any health service in an approved Medicaid plan, it follows that Title XIX does not require a participating State to include in its plan any services for which a subsequent Congress has withheld federal funding.[12] Title XIX was designed as a cooperative program of shared financial responsibility, not as a device for the Federal Government to compel a State to provide services that Congress itself is unwilling to fund. Thus, if Congress chooses to withdraw federal funding for a particular service, a State is not obliged to continue to pay for that service as a condition of continued federal financial support of other services. This is not to say that Congress may not now depart from the original design of Title XIX under which the Federal Government shares the financial responsibility for expenses incurred under an approved Medicaid plan. It is only to say that, absent an indication of contrary legislative intent by a subsequent Congress, Title XIX does not obligate a participating State to pay for those medical services for which federal reimbursement is unavailable.[13]
*310 Thus, by the normal operation of Title XIX, even if a State were otherwise required to include medically necessary abortions in its Medicaid plan, the withdrawal of federal funding under the Hyde Amendment would operate to relieve the State of that obligation for those abortions for which federal reimbursement is unavailable.[14] The legislative history of the Hyde Amendment contains no indication whatsoever that Congress intended to shift the entire cost of such services to the participating States. See Zbaraz v. Quern, supra, at 200 (""no one, whether supporting or opposing the Hyde Amendment, ever suggested that state funding would be required""). Rather, the legislative history suggests that Congress has always assumed that a participating State would not be required to fund medically necessary abortions once federal funding was withdrawn pursuant to the Hyde Amendment.[15] See Preterm, Inc. v. Dukakis, supra, at 130 (""[t]he universal assumption in debate was that if the Amendment passed there would be no requirement that states carry on the service""). Accord, Zbaraz v. Quern, supra, at 200; Hodgson v. Board of County Comm'rs, 614 F.2d 601, 612-613 (CA8 *311 1980); Roe v. Casey, 623 F.2d 829, 834-837 (CA3 1980). Accordingly, we conclude that Title XIX does not require a participating State to pay for those medically necessary abortions for which federal reimbursement is unavailable under the Hyde Amendment.[16]

III
Having determined that Title XIX does not obligate a participating State to pay for those medically necessary abortions for which Congress has withheld federal funding, we must consider the constitutional validity of the Hyde Amendment. The appellees assert that the funding restrictions of the Hyde Amendment violate several rights secured by the Constitution (1) the right of a woman, implicit in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy, (2) the prohibition under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment against any ""law respecting an establishment of religion,"" and (3) the right to freedom of religion protected by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The appellees also contend that, quite apart from substantive constitutional rights, the Hyde Amendment violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.[17]
*312 It is well settled that, quite apart from the guarantee of equal protection, if a law ""impinges upon a fundamental right explicitly or implicitly secured by the Constitution [it] is presumptively unconstitutional."" Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 76 (plurality opinion). Accordingly, before turning to the equal protection issue in this case, we examine whether the Hyde Amendment violates any substantive rights secured by the Constitution.

A
We address first the appellees' argument that the Hyde Amendment, by restricting the availability of certain medically necessary abortions under Medicaid, impinges on the ""liberty"" protected by the Due Process Clause as recognized in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, and its progeny.
In the Wade case, this Court held unconstitutional a Texas statute making it a crime to procure or attempt an abortion except on medical advice for the purpose of saving the mother's life. The constitutional underpinning of Wade was a recognition that the ""liberty"" protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment includes not only the freedoms explicitly mentioned in the Bill of Rights, but also a freedom of personal choice in certain matters of marriage and family life.[18] This implicit constitutional liberty, the Court in Wade held, includes the freedom of a woman to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy.
*313 But the Court in Wade also recognized that a State has legitimate interests during a pregnancy in both ensuring the health of the mother and protecting potential human life. These state interests, which were found to be ""separate and distinct"" and to ""gro[w] in substantiality as the woman approaches term,"" id., at 162-163, pose a conflict with a woman's untrammeled freedom of choice. In resolving this conflict, the Court held that before the end of the first trimester of pregnancy, neither state interest is sufficiently substantial to justify any intrusion on the woman's freedom of choice. In the second trimester, the state interest in maternal health was found to be sufficiently substantial to justify regulation reasonably related to that concern. And at viability, usually in the third trimester, the state interest in protecting the potential life of the fetus was found to justify a criminal prohibition against abortions, except where necessary for the preservation of the life or health of the mother. Thus, inasmuch as the Texas criminal statute allowed abortions only where necessary to save the life of the mother and without regard to the stage of the pregnancy, the Court held in Wade that the statute violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
In Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, the Court was presented with the question whether the scope of personal constitutional freedom recognized in Roe v. Wade included an entitlement to Medicaid payments for abortions that are not medically necessary. At issue in Maher was a Connecticut welfare regulation under which Medicaid recipients received payments for medical services incident to childbirth, but not for medical services incident to nontherapeutic abortions. The District Court held that the regulation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the unequal subsidization of childbirth and abortion impinged on the ""fundamental right to abortion"" recognized in Wade and its progeny.
*314 It was the view of this Court that ""the District Court misconceived the nature and scope of the fundamental right recognized in Roe."" 432 U.S., at 471. The doctrine of Roe v. Wade, the Court held in Maher, ""protects the woman from unduly burdensome interference with her freedom to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy,"" id., at 473-474, such as the severe criminal sanctions at issue in Roe v. Wade, supra, or the absolute requirement of spousal consent for an abortion challenged in Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52.
But the constitutional freedom recognized in Wade and its progeny, the Maher Court explained, did not prevent Connecticut from making ""a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion, and . . . implement[ing] that judgment by the allocation of public funds."" 432 U.S., at 474. As the Court elaborated:
""The Connecticut regulation before us is different in kind from the laws invalidated in our previous abortion decisions. The Connecticut regulation places no obstacles absolute or otherwisein the pregnant woman's path to an abortion. An indigent woman who desires an abortion suffers no disadvantage as a consequence of Connecticut's decision to fund childbirth; she continues as before to be dependent on private sources for the service she desires. The State may have made childbirth a more attractive alternative, thereby influencing the woman's decision, but it has imposed no restriction on access to abortions that was not already there. The indigency that may make it difficultand in some cases, perhaps, impossiblefor some women to have abortions is neither created nor in any way affected by the Connecticut regulation."" Ibid.

The Court in Maher noted that its description of the doctrine recognized in Wade and its progeny signaled ""no retreat"" from those decisions. In explaining why the constitutional *315 principle recognized in Wade and later cases protecting a woman's freedom of choicedid not translate into a constitutional obligation of Connecticut to subsidize abortions, the Court cited the ""basic difference between direct state interference with a protected activity and state encouragement of an alternative activity consonant with legislative policy. Constitutional concerns are greatest when the State attempts to impose its will by force of law; the State's power to encourage actions deemed to be in the public interest is necessarily far broader."" 432 U.S., at 475-476 (footnote omitted). Thus, even though the Connecticut regulation favored childbirth over abortion by means of subsidization of one and not the other, the Court in Maher concluded that the regulation did not impinge on the constitutional freedom recognized in Wade because it imposed no governmental restriction on access to abortions.
The Hyde Amendment, like the Connecticut welfare regulation at issue in Maher, places no governmental obstacle in the path of a woman who chooses to terminate her pregnancy, but rather, by means of unequal subsidization of abortion and other medical services, encourages alternative activity deemed in the public interest. The present case does differ factually from Maher insofar as that case involved a failure to fund nontherapeutic abortions, whereas the Hyde Amendment withholds funding of certain medically necessary abortions. Accordingly, the appellees argue that because the Hyde Amendment affects a significant interest not present or asserted in Maherthe interest of a woman in protecting her health during pregnancyand because that interest lies at the core of the personal constitutional freedom recognized in Wade, the present case is constitutionally different from Maher. It is the appellees' view that to the extent that the Hyde Amendment withholds funding for certain medically necessary abortions, it clearly impinges on the constitutional principle recognized in Wade.
*316 It is evident that a woman's interest in protecting her health was an important theme in Wade. In concluding that the freedom of a woman to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy falls within the personal liberty protected by the Due Process Clause, the Court in Wade emphasized the fact that the woman's decision carries with it significant personal health implicationsboth physical and psychological. 410 U.S., at 153. In fact, although the Court in Wade recognized that the state interest in protecting potential life becomes sufficiently compelling in the period after fetal viability to justify an absolute criminal prohibition of nontherapeutic abortions, the Court held that even after fetal viability a State may not prohibit abortions ""necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother."" Id., at 164. Because even the compelling interest of the State in protecting potential life after fetal viability was held to be insufficient to outweigh a woman's decision to protect her life or health, it could be argued that the freedom of a woman to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy for health reasons does in fact lie at the core of the constitutional liberty identified in Wade.
But, regardless of whether the freedom of a woman to choose to terminate her pregnancy for health reasons lies at the core or the periphery of the due process liberty recognized in Wade, it simply does not follow that a woman's freedom of choice carries with it a constitutional entitlement to the financial resources to avail herself of the full range of protected choices. The reason why was explained in Maher: although government may not place obstacles in the path of a woman's exercise of her freedom of choice, it need not remove those not of its own creation. Indigency falls in the latter category. The financial constraints that restrict an indigent woman's ability to enjoy the full range of constitutionally protected freedom of choice are the product not of governmental restrictions on access to abortions, but rather of her indigency. Although Congress has opted to subsidize *317 medically necessary services generally, but not certain medically necessary abortions, the fact remains that the Hyde Amendment leaves an indigent woman with at least the same range of choice in deciding whether to obtain a medically necessary abortion as she would have had if Congress had chosen to subsidize no health care costs at all. We are thus not persuaded that the Hyde Amendment impinges on the constitutionally protected freedom of choice recognized in Wade.[19]
Although the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause affords protection against unwarranted government interference with freedom of choice in the context of certain personal *318 decisions, it does not confer an entitlement to such funds as may be necessary to realize all the advantages of that freedom. To hold otherwise would mark a drastic change in our understanding of the Constitution. It cannot be that because government may not prohibit the use of contraceptives, Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, or prevent parents from sending their child to a private school, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, government, therefore, has an affirmative constitutional obligation to ensure that all persons have the financial resources to obtain contraceptives or send their children to private schools. To translate the limitation on governmental power implicit in the Due Process Clause into an affirmative funding obligation would require Congress to subsidize the medically necessary abortion of an indigent woman even if Congress had not enacted a Medicaid program to subsidize other medically necessary services. Nothing in the Due Process Clause supports such an extraordinary result.[20] Whether freedom of choice that is constitutionally protected warrants federal subsidization is a question for Congress to answer, not a matter of constitutional entitlement. Accordingly, we conclude that the Hyde Amendment does not impinge on the due process liberty recognized in Wade.[21]

B
The appellees also argue that the Hyde Amendment contravenes rights secured by the Religion Clauses of the First *319 Amendment. It is the appellees' view that the Hyde Amendment violates the Establishment Clause because it incorporates into law the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church concerning the sinfulness of abortion and the time at which life commences. Moreover, insofar as a woman's decision to seek a medically necessary abortion may be a product of her religious beliefs under certain Protestant and Jewish tenets, the appellees assert that the funding limitations of the Hyde Amendment impinge on the freedom of religion guaranteed by the Free Exercise Clause.

1
It is well settled that ""a legislative enactment does not contravene the Establishment Clause if it has a secular legislative purpose, if its principal or primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion, and if it does not foster an excessive governmental entanglement with religion."" Committee for Public Education v. Regan, 444 U.S. 646, 653. Applying this standard, the District Court properly concluded that the Hyde Amendment does not run afoul of the Establishment Clause. Although neither a State nor the Federal Government can constitutionally ""pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another,"" Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1, 15, it does not follow that a statute violates the Establishment Clause because it ""happens to coincide or harmonize with the tenets of some or all religions."" McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 442. That the Judaeo-Christian religions oppose stealing does not mean that a State or the Federal Government may not, consistent with the Establishment Clause, enact laws prohibiting larceny. Ibid. The Hyde Amendment, as the District Court noted, is as much a reflection of ""traditionalist"" values towards abortion, as it is an embodiment of the views of any particular religion. 491 F. Supp., at 741. See also Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S., at 138-141. In sum, we are convinced that the fact that the funding restrictions in the *320 Hyde Amendment may coincide with the religious tenets of the Roman Catholic Church does not, without more, contravene the Establishment Clause.

2
We need not address the merits of the appellees' arguments concerning the Free Exercise Clause, because the appellees lack standing to raise a free exercise challenge to the Hyde Amendment. The named appellees fall into three categories: (1) the indigent pregnant women who sued on behalf of other women similarly situated, (2) the two officers of the Women's Division, and (3) the Women's Division itself.[22] The named appellees in the first category lack standing to challenge the Hyde Amendment on free exercise grounds because none alleged, much less proved, that she sought an abortion under compulsion of religious belief.[23] See McGowan v. Maryland, supra, at 429. Although the named appellees in the second category did provide a detailed description of their religious beliefs, they failed to allege either that they are or expect to be pregnant or that they are eligible to receive Medicaid. These named appellees, therefore, lack the personal stake in the controversy needed to confer standing to raise such a challenge to the Hyde Amendment. See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498-499.
Finally, although the Women's Division alleged that its *321 membership includes ""pregnant Medicaid eligible women who, as a matter of religious practice and in accordance with their conscientious beliefs, would choose but are precluded or discouraged from obtaining abortions reimbursed by Medicaid because of the Hyde Amendment,"" the Women's Division does not satisfy the standing requirements for an organization to assert the rights of its membership. One of those requirements is that ""neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit."" Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U.S. 333, 343. Since ""it is necessary in a free exercise case for one to show the coercive effect of the enactment as it operates against him in the practice of his religion,"" Abington School Dist. v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 223, the claim asserted here is one that ordinarily requires individual participation.[24] In the present case, the Women's Division concedes that ""the permissibility, advisability and/or necessity of abortion according to circumstance is a matter about which there is diversity of view within . . . our membership, and is a determination which must be ultimately and absolutely entrusted to the conscience of the individual before God."" It is thus clear that the participation of individual members of the Women's Division is essential to a proper understanding and resolution of their free exercise claims. Accordingly, we conclude that the Women's Division, along with the other named appellees, lack standing to challenge the Hyde Amendment under the Free Exercise Clause.

C
It remains to be determined whether the Hyde Amendment violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment. This challenge is premised on the fact that, although *322 federal reimbursement is available under Medicaid for medically necessary services generally, the Hyde Amendment does not permit federal reimbursement of all medically necessary abortions. The District Court held, and the appellees argue here, that this selective subsidization violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection.
The guarantee of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment is not a source of substantive rights or liberties,[25] but rather a right to be free from invidious discrimination in statutory classifications and other governmental activity. It is well settled that where a statutory classification does not itself impinge on a right or liberty protected by the Constitution, the validity of classification must be sustained unless ""the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of [any legitimate governmental] objective."" McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S., at 425. This presumption of constitutional validity, however, disappears if a statutory classification is predicated on criteria that are, in a constitutional sense, ""suspect,"" the principal example of which is a classification based on race, e. g., Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483.

1
For the reasons stated above, we have already concluded that the Hyde Amendment violates no constitutionally protected substantive rights. We now conclude as well that it is not predicated on a constitutionally suspect classification. In reaching this conclusion, we again draw guidance from the Court's decision in Maher v. Roe. As to whether the Connecticut *323 welfare regulation providing funds for childbirth but not for nontherapeutic abortions discriminated against a suspect class, the Court in Maher observed:
""An indigent woman desiring an abortion does not come within the limited category of disadvantaged classes so recognized by our cases. Nor does the fact that the impact of the regulation falls upon those who cannot pay lead to a different conclusion. In a sense, every denial of welfare to an indigent creates a wealth classification as compared to nonindigents who are able to pay for the desired goods or services. But this Court has never held that financial need alone identifies a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis."" 432 U.S., at 470-471, citing San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 29; Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471.
Thus, the Court in Maher found no basis for concluding that the Connecticut regulation was predicated on a suspect classification.
It is our view that the present case is indistinguishable from Maher in this respect. Here, as in Maher, the principal impact of the Hyde Amendment falls on the indigent. But that fact does not itself render the funding restriction constitutionally invalid, for this Court has held repeatedly that poverty, standing alone, is not a suspect classification. See, e. g., James v. Valtierra, 402 U.S. 137. That Maher involved the refusal to fund nontherapeutic abortions, whereas the present case involves the refusal to fund medically necessary abortions, has no bearing on the factors that render a classification ""suspect"" within the meaning of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection.[26]


*324 2
The remaining question then is whether the Hyde Amendment is rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective. It is the Government's position that the Hyde Amendment bears a rational relationship to its legitimate interest in protecting the potential life of the fetus. We agree.
In Wade, the Court recognized that the State has an ""important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life."" 410 U.S., at 162. That interest was found to exist throughout a pregnancy, ""grow[ing] in substantiality as the woman approaches term."" Id., at 162-163. See also Beal v. Doe, 432 U. S., at 445-446. Moreover, in Maher, the Court held that Connecticut's decision to fund the costs associated with childbirth but not those associated with nontherapeutic abortions was a rational means of advancing the legitimate state interest in protecting potential life by *325 encouraging childbirth. 432 U.S., at 478-479. See also Poelker v. Doe, 432 U.S. 519, 520-521.
It follows that the Hyde Amendment, by encouraging childbirth except in the most urgent circumstances, is rationally related to the legitimate governmental objective of protecting potential life. By subsidizing the medical expenses of indigent women who carry their pregnancies to term while not subsidizing the comparable expenses of women who undergo abortions (except those whose lives are threatened),[27] Congress has established incentives that make childbirth a more attractive alternative than abortion for persons eligible for Medicaid. These incentives bear a direct relationship to the legitimate congressional interest in protecting potential life. Nor is it irrational that Congress has authorized federal reimbursement for medically necessary services generally, but not for certain medically necessary abortions.[28] Abortion is inherently different from other medical procedures, because no other procedure involves the purposeful termination of a potential life.
After conducting an extensive evidentiary hearing into issues surrounding the public funding of abortions, the District Court concluded that ""[t]he interests of . . . the federal government . . . in the fetus and in preserving it are not sufficient, weighed in the balance with the woman's threatened health, to justify withdrawing medical assistance unless the *326 woman consents . . . to carry the fetus to term."" 491 F. Supp., at 737. In making an independent appraisal of the competing interests involved here, the District Court went beyond the judicial function. Such decisions are entrusted under the Constitution to Congress, not the courts. It is the role of the courts only to ensure that congressional decisions comport with the Constitution.
Where, as here, the Congress has neither invaded a substantive constitutional right or freedom, nor enacted legislation that purposefully operates to the detriment of a suspect class, the only requirement of equal protection is that congressional action be rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. The Hyde Amendment satisfies that standard. It is not the mission of this Court or any other to decide whether the balance of competing interests reflected in the Hyde Amendment is wise social policy. If that were our mission, not every Justice who has subscribed to the judgment of the Court today could have done so. But we cannot, in the name of the Constitution, overturn duly enacted statutes simply ""because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought."" Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 488, quoted in Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U. S., at 484. Rather, ""when an issue involves policy choices as sensitive as those implicated [here] . . ., the appropriate forum for their resolution in a democracy is the legislature."" Maher v. Roe, supra, at 479.

IV
For the reasons stated in this opinion, we hold that a State that participates in the Medicaid program is not obligated under Title XIX to continue to fund those medically necessary abortions for which federal reimbursement is unavailable under the Hyde Amendment. We further hold that the funding restrictions of the Hyde Amendment violate neither the Fifth Amendment nor the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. It is also our view that the appellees *327 lack standing to raise a challenge to the Hyde Amendment under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
MR."
11833,Justice White,concurring,False,Harris v. McRae,,1980,1.0,"I join the Court's opinion and judgment with these additional remarks.
Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), held that prior to viability of the fetus, the governmental interest in potential life was insufficient to justify overriding the due process right of a pregnant woman to terminate her pregnancy by abortion. In the last trimester, however, the State's interest in fetal life was deemed sufficiently strong to warrant a ban on abortions, but only if continuing the pregnancy did not threaten the life or health of the mother. In the latter event, the State was required to respect the choice of the mother to terminate the pregnancy and protect her health.
Drawing upon Roe v. Wade and the cases that followed it, MR. JUSTICE STEVENS' dissent extrapolates the general proposition that the governmental interest in potential life may in no event be pursued at the expense of the mother's health. It then notes that under the Hyde Amendment, Medicaid refuses to fund abortions where carrying to term threatens maternal health but finances other medically indicated procedures, including childbirth. The dissent submits that the Hyde Amendment therefore fails the first requirement imposed by the Fifth Amendment and recognized by the Court's opinion todaythat the challenged official action must serve a legitimate governmental goal, ante, at 324.
The argument has a certain internal logic, but it is not legally sound. The constitutional right recognized in Roe v. Wade was the right to choose to undergo an abortion without coercive interference by the government. As the Court *328 points out, Roe v. Wade did not purport to adjudicate a right to have abortions funded by the government, but only to be free from unreasonable official interference with private choice. At an appropriate stage in a pregnancy, for example, abortions could be prohibited to implement the governmental interest in potential life, but in no case to the damage of the health of the mother, whose choice to suffer an abortion rather than risk her health the government was forced to respect.
Roe v. Wade thus dealt with the circumstances in which the governmental interest in potential life would justify official interference with the abortion choices of pregnant women. There is no such calculus involved here. The Government does not seek to interfere with or to impose any coercive restraint on the choice of any woman to have an abortion. The woman's choice remains unfettered, the Government is not attempting to use its interest in life to justify a coercive restraint, and hence in disbursing its Medicaid funds it is free to implement rationally what Roe v. Wade recognized to be its legitimate interest in a potential life by covering the medical costs of childbirth but denying funds for abortions. Neither Roe v. Wade nor any of the cases decided in its wake invalidates this legislative preference. We decided as much in Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464 (1977), when we rejected the claims that refusing funds for nontherapeutic abortions while defraying the medical costs of childbirth, although not an outright prohibition, nevertheless infringed the fundamental right to choose to terminate a pregnancy by abortion and also violated the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment. I would not abandon Maher and extend Roe v. Wade to forbid the legislative policy expressed in the Hyde Amendment.
Nor can Maher be successfully distinguished on the ground that it involved only nontherapeutic abortions that the Government was free to place outside the ambit of its Medicaid program. That is not the ground on which Maher proceeded. *329 Maher held that the government need not fund elective abortions because withholding funds rationally furthered the State's legitimate interest in normal childbirth. We sustained this policy even though under Roe v. Wade, the government's interest in fetal life is an inadequate justification for coercive interference with the pregnant woman's right to choose an abortion, whether or not such a procedure is medically indicated. We have already held, therefore, that the interest balancing involved in Roe v. Wade is not controlling in resolving the present constitutional issue. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the straightforward analysis followed in MR. JUSTICE STEWART'S opinion for the Court is sound.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL and MR."
11835,Justice Marshall,second_dissenting,False,Harris v. McRae,,1980,1.0,"[*]
Three years ago, in Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464 (1977), the Court upheld a state program that excluded nontherapeutic abortions from a welfare program that generally subsidized the medical expenses incidental to pregnancy and childbirth. At that time, I expressed my fear ""that the Court's decisions will be an invitation to public officials, already under extraordinary pressure from well-financed and carefully orchestrated lobbying campaigns, to approve more such restrictions"" on governmental funding for abortion. Id., at 462 (dissenting both in Maher v. Roe, supra, and in Beal v. Doe, 432 U.S. 438 (1977), and Poelker v. Doe, 432 U.S. 519 (1977)).
*338 That fear has proved justified. Under the Hyde Amendment, federal funding is denied for abortions that are medically necessary and that are necessary to avert severe and permanent damage to the health of the mother. The Court's opinion studiously avoids recognizing the undeniable fact that for women eligible for Medicaidpoor womendenial of a Medicaid-funded abortion is equivalent to denial of legal abortion altogether. By definition, these women do not have the money to pay for an abortion themselves. If abortion is medically necessary and a funded abortion is unavailable, they must resort to back-alley butchers, attempt to induce an abortion themselves by crude and dangerous methods, or suffer the serious medical consequences of attempting to carry the fetus to term. Because legal abortion is not a realistic option for such women, the predictable result of the Hyde Amendment will be a significant increase in the number of poor women who will die or suffer significant health damage because of an inability to procure necessary medical services.
The legislation before us is the product of an effort to deny to the poor the constitutional right recognized in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), even though the cost may be serious and long-lasting health damage. As my Brother STEVENS has demonstrated, see post, p. 349 (dissenting opinion), the premise underlying the Hyde Amendment was repudiated in Roe v. Wade, where the Court made clear that the state interest in protecting fetal life cannot justify jeopardizing the life or health of the mother. The denial of Medicaid benefits to individuals who meet all the statutory criteria for eligibility, solely because the treatment that is medically necessary involves the exercise of the fundamental right to chose abortion, is a form of discrimination repugnant to the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Constitution. The Court's decision today marks a retreat from Roe v. Wade and represents a cruel blow to the most powerless members of our society. I dissent.


*339 I
In its present form, the Hyde Amendment restricts federal funding for abortion to cases in which ""the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term"" and ""for such medical procedures necessary for the victims of rape or incest when such rape or incest has been reported promptly to a law enforcement agency or public health service."" See ante, at 302. Federal funding is thus unavailable even when severe and long-lasting health damage to the mother is a virtual certainty. Nor are federal funds available when severe health damage, or even death, will result to the fetus if it is carried to term.
The record developed below reveals that the standards set forth in the Hyde Amendment exclude the majority of cases in which the medical profession would recommend abortion as medically necessary. Indeed, in States that have adopted a standard more restrictive than the ""medically necessary"" test of the Medicaid Act, the number of funded abortions has decreased by over 98%. App. 289.
The impact of the Hyde Amendment on indigent women falls into four major categories. First, the Hyde Amendment prohibits federal funding for abortions that are necessary in order to protect the health and sometimes the life of the mother. Numerous conditionssuch as cancer, rheumatic fever, diabetes, malnutrition, phlebitis, sickle cell anemia, and heart diseasesubstantially increase the risks associated with pregnancy or are themselves aggravated by pregnancy. Such conditions may make an abortion medically necessary in the judgment of a physician, but cannot be funded under the Hyde Amendment. Further, the health risks of undergoing an abortion increase dramatically as pregnancy becomes more advanced. By the time a pregnancy has progressed to the point where a physician is able to certify that it endangers the life of the mother, it is in many cases too late to prevent her death because abortion is no *340 longer safe. There are also instances in which a woman's life will not be immediately threatened by carrying the pregnancy to term, but aggravation of another medical condition will significantly shorten her life expectancy. These cases as well are not fundable under the Hyde Amendment.
Second, federal funding is denied in cases in which severe mental disturbances will be created by unwanted pregnancies. The result of such psychological disturbances may be suicide, attempts at self-abortion, or child abuse. The Hyde Amendment makes no provision for funding in such cases.
Third, the Hyde Amendment denies funding for the majority of women whose pregnancies have been caused by rape or incest. The prerequisite of a report within 60 days serves to exclude those who are afraid of recounting what has happened or are in fear of unsympathetic treatment by the authorities. Such a requirement is, of course, especially burdensome for the indigent, who may be least likely to be aware that a rapid report to the authorities is indispensable in order for them to be able to obtain an abortion.
Finally, federal funding is unavailable in cases in which it is known that the fetus itself will be unable to survive. In a number of situations it is possible to determine in advance that the fetus will suffer an early death if carried to term. The Hyde Amendment, purportedly designed to safeguard ""the legitimate governmental objective of protecting potential life,"" ante, at 325, excludes federal funding in such cases.
An optimistic estimate indicates that as many as 100 excess deaths may occur each year as a result of the Hyde Amendment.[1] The record contains no estimate of the health damage that may occur to poor women, but it shows that it will be considerable.[2]


*341 II
The Court resolves the equal protection issue in this case through a relentlessly formalistic catechism. Adhering to its ""two-tiered"" approach to equal protection, the Court first decides that so-called strict scrutiny is not required because the Hyde Amendment does not violate the Due Process Clause and is not predicated on a constitutionally suspect classification. Therefore, ""the validity of classification must be sustained unless `the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of [any legitimate governmental] objective.'"" Ante, at 322 (bracketed material in original), quoting McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 425 (1961). Observing that previous cases have recognized ""the legitimate governmental objective of protecting potential life,"" ante, at 325, the Court concludes that the Hyde Amendment ""establishe[s] incentives that make childbirth a more attractive alternative than abortion for persons eligible for Medicaid,"" ibid., and is therefore rationally related to that governmental interest.
I continue to believe that the rigid ""two-tiered"" approach is inappropriate and that the Constitution requires a more exacting standard of review than mere rationality in cases such as this one. Further, in my judgment the Hyde Amendment cannot pass constitutional muster even under the rational-basis standard of review.

A
This case is perhaps the most dramatic illustration to date of the deficiencies in the Court's obsolete ""two-tiered"" approach to the Equal Protection Clause. See San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 98-110 (1973) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting); Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 318-321 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting); Maher v. Roe, 432 U. S., at 457-458 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting); Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, *342 113-115 (1979) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).[3] With all deference, I am unable to understand how the Court can afford the same level of scrutiny to the legislation involved herewhose cruel impact falls exclusively on indigent pregnant women that it has given to legislation distinguishing opticians from ophthalmologists, or to other legislation that makes distinctions between economic interests more than able to protect themselves in the political process. See ante, at 326, citing Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483 (1955). Heightened scrutiny of legislative classifications has always been designed to protect groups ""saddled with such disabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment, or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process."" San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, supra, at 28.[4] And while it is now clear that traditional ""strict scrutiny"" is unavailable to protect the poor against classifications that disfavor them, Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471 (1970), I do not believe that legislation that imposes a crushing burden on indigent women can be treated with the same deference given to legislation distinguishing among business interests.


*343 B
The Hyde Amendment, of course, distinguishes between medically necessary abortions and other medically necessary expenses.[5] As I explained in Maher v. Roe, supra, such classifications must be assessed by weighing ""`the importance of the governmental benefits denied, the character of the class, and the asserted state interests,'"" id., at 458, quoting Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, supra, at 322. Under that approach, the Hyde Amendment is clearly invalid.[6]
As in Maher, the governmental benefits at issue here are ""of absolutely vital importance in the lives of the recipients."" Maher v. Roe, supra, at 458 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). An indigent woman denied governmental funding for a medically necessary abortion is confronted with two grotesque choices. First, she may seek to obtain ""an illegal abortion that poses a serious threat to her health and even her life."" 432 U.S., at 458. Alternatively, she may attempt to bear the child, a course that may both significantly threaten her health and eliminate any chance she might have had ""to control the direction of her own life,"" id., at 459.
The class burdened by the Hyde Amendment consists of indigent women, a substantial proportion of whom are members of minority races. As I observed in Maher, nonwhite women obtain abortions at nearly double the rate of whites, ibid. In my view, the fact that the burden of the Hyde Amendment falls exclusively on financially destitute women *344 suggests ""a special condition, which tends seriously to curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities, and which may call for a correspondingly more searching judicial inquiry."" United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 153, n. 4 (1938). For this reason, I continue to believe that ""a showing that state action has a devastating impact on the lives of minority racial groups must be relevant"" for purposes of equal protection analysis. Jefferson v. Hackney, 406 U.S. 535, 575-576 (1972) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).
As I explained in Maher, the asserted state interest in protecting potential life is insufficient to ""outweigh the deprivation or serious discouragement of a vital constitutional right of especial importance to poor and minority women."" 432 U.S., at 461. In Maher, the Court found a permissible state interest in encouraging normal childbirth. Id., at 477-479. The governmental interest in the present case is substantially weaker than in Maher, for under the Hyde Amendment funding is refused even in cases in which normal childbirth will not result: one can scarcely speak of ""normal childbirth"" in cases where the fetus will die shortly after birth, or in which the mother's life will be shortened or her health otherwise gravely impaired by the birth. Nevertheless, the Hyde Amendment denies funding even in such cases. In these circumstances, I am unable to see how even a minimally rational legislature could conclude that the interest in fetal life outweighs the brutal effect of the Hyde Amendment on indigent women. Moreover, both the legislation in Maher and the Hyde Amendment were designed to deprive poor and minority women of the constitutional right to choose abortion. That purpose is not constitutionally permitted under Roe v. Wade.

C
Although I would abandon the strict-scrutiny/rational-basis dichotomy in equal protection analysis, it is by no *345 means necessary to reject that traditional approach to conclude, as I do, that the Hyde Amendment is a denial of equal protection. My Brother BRENNAN has demonstrated that the Amendment is unconstitutional because it impermissibly infringes upon the individual's constitutional right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy. See ante, at 332-334 (dissenting opinion). And as my Brother STEVENS demonstrates, see post, at 350-352 (dissenting opinion), the Government's interest in protecting fetal life is not a legitimate one when it is in conflict with ""the preservation of the life or health of the mother,"" Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S., at 165, and when the Government's effort to make serious health damage to the mother ""a more attractive alternative than abortion,"" ante, at 325, does not rationally promote the governmental interest in encouraging normal childbirth.
The Court treats this case as though it were controlled by Maher. To the contrary, this case is the mirror image of Maher. The result in Maher turned on the fact that the legislation there under consideration discouraged only non-therapeutic, or medically unnecessary, abortions. In the Court's view, denial of Medicaid funding for nontherapeutic abortions was not a denial of equal protection because Medicaid funds were available only for medically necessary procedures. Thus the plaintiffs were seeking benefits which were not available to others similarly situated. I continue to believe that Maher was wrongly decided. But it is apparent that while the plaintiffs in Maher were seeking a benefit not available to others similarly situated, appellees are protesting their exclusion from a benefit that is available to all others similarly situated. This, it need hardly be said, is a crucial difference for equal protection purposes.
Under Title XIX and the Hyde Amendment, funding is available for essentially all necessary medical treatment for the poor. Appellees have met the statutory requirements for eligibility, but they are excluded because the treatment that is medically necessary involves the exercise of a fundamental *346 right, the right to choose an abortion. In short, these appellees have been deprived of a governmental benefit for which they are otherwise eligible, solely because they have attempted to exercise a constitutional right. The interest asserted by the Government, the protection of fetal life, has been declared constitutionally subordinate to appellees' interest in preserving their lives and health by obtaining medically necessary treatment. Roe v. Wade, supra. And finally, the purpose of the legislation was to discourage the exercise of the fundamental right. In such circumstances the Hyde Amendment must be invalidated because it does not meet even the rational-basis standard of review.

III
The consequences of today's opinionconsequences to which the Court seems obliviousare not difficult to predict. Pregnant women denied the funding necessary to procure abortions will be restricted to two alternatives. First, they can carry the fetus to termeven though that route may result in severe injury or death to the mother, the fetus, or both. If that course appears intolerable, they can resort to self-induced abortions or attempt to obtain illegal abortions not because bearing a child would be inconvenient, but because it is necessary in order to protect their health.[7] The result will not be to protect what the Court describes as ""the legitimate governmental objective of protecting potential life,"" ante, at 325, but to ensure the destruction of both fetal and maternal life. ""There is another world `out there,' the existence of which the Court . . . either chooses to ignore or fears *347 to recognize."" Beal v. Doe, 432 U. S., at 463 (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting). In my view, it is only by blinding itself to that other world that the Court can reach the result it announces today.
Ultimately, the result reached today may be traced to the Court's unwillingness to apply the constraints of the Constitution to decisions involving the expenditure of governmental funds. In today's decision, as in Maher v. Roe, the Court suggests that a withholding of funding imposes no real obstacle to a woman deciding whether to exercise her constitutionally protected procreative choice, even though the Government is prepared to fund all other medically necessary expenses, including the expenses of childbirth. The Court perceives this result as simply a distinction between a ""limitation on governmental power"" and ""an affirmative funding obligation."" Ante, at 318. For a poor person attempting to exercise her ""right"" to freedom of choice, the difference is imperceptible. As my Brother BRENNAN has shown, see ante, at 332-334 (dissenting opinion), the differential distribution of incentiveswhich the Court concedes is present here, see ante, at 325can have precisely the same effect as an outright prohibition. It is no more sufficient an answer here than it was in Roe v. Wade to say that ""`the appropriate forum'"" for the resolution of sensitive policy choices is the legislature. See ante, at 326, quoting Maher v. Roe, at 479.
More than 35 years ago, Mr. Justice Jackson observed that the ""task of translating the majestic generalities of the Bill of Rights . . . into concrete restraints on officials dealing with the problems of the twentieth century, is one to disturb self-confidence."" West Virginia State Bd. of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 639 (1943). These constitutional principles, he observed for the Court, ""grew in soil which also produced a philosophy that the individual['s] . . . liberty was attainable through mere absence of governmental restraints."" Ibid. Those principles must be ""transplant[ed] . . . to a soil in which the laissez-faire concept or principle of non-interference *348 has withered at least as to economic affairs, and social advancements are increasingly sought through closer integration of society and through expanded and strengthened governmental controls."" Id., at 640.
In this case, the Federal Government has taken upon itself the burden of financing practically all medically necessary expenditures. One category of medically necessary expenditure has been singled out for exclusion, and the sole basis for the exclusion is a premise repudiated for purposes of constitutional law in Roe v. Wade. The consequence is a devastating impact on the lives and health of poor women. I do not believe that a Constitution committed to the equal protection of the laws can tolerate this result. I dissent.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, dissenting.[*]
I join the dissent of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN and agree wholeheartedly with his and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS' respective observations and descriptions of what the Court is doing in this latest round of ""abortion cases."" I need add only that I find what I said in dissent in Beal v. Doe, 432 U.S. 438, 462 (1977), and its two companion cases, Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464 (1977), and Poelker v. Doe, 432 U.S. 519 (1977), continues for me to be equally pertinent and equally applicable in these Hyde Amendment cases. There is ""condescension"" in the Court's holding that ""she may go elsewhere for her abortion""; this is ""disingenuous and alarming""; the Government ""punitively impresses upon a needy minority its own concepts of the socially desirable, the publicly acceptable, and the morally sound""; the ""financial argument, of course, is specious""; there truly is ""another world 'out there,' the existence of which the Court, I suspect, either chooses to ignore *349 or fears to recognize""; the ""cancer of poverty will continue to grow""; and ""the lot of the poorest among us,"" once again, and still, is not to be bettered.
MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.[*]
""The federal sovereign, like the States, must govern impartially. The concept of equal justice under law is served by the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process, as well as by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."" Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U.S. 88, 100. When the sovereign provides a special benefit or a special protection for a class of persons, it must define the membership in the class by neutral criteria; it may not make special exceptions for reasons that are constitutionally insufficient.
These cases involve the pool of benefits that Congress created by enacting Title XIX of the Social Security Act in 1965. Individuals who satisfy two neutral statutory criteria financial need and medical needare entitled to equal access to that pool. The question is whether certain persons who satisfy those criteria may be denied access to benefits solely because they must exercise the constitutional right to have an abortion in order to obtain the medical care they need. Our prior cases plainly dictate the answer to that question.
A fundamentally different question was decided in Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464. Unlike these plaintiffs, the plaintiffs in Maher did not satisfy the neutral criterion of medical need; they sought a subsidy for nontherapeutic abortions medical procedures which by definition they did not need. In rejecting that claim, the Court held that their constitutional right to choose that procedure did not impose a duty on *350 the State to subsidize the exercise of that right. Nor did the fact that the State had undertaken to pay for the necessary medical care associated with childbirth require the State also to pay for abortions that were not necessary; for only necessary medical procedures satisfied the neutral statutory criteria. Nontherapeutic abortions were simply outside the ambit of the medical benefits program. Thus, in Maher, the plaintiffs' desire to exercise a constitutional right gave rise to neither special access nor special exclusion from the pool of benefits created by Title XIX.
These cases involve a special exclusion of women who, by definition, are confronted with a choice between two serious harms: serious health damage to themselves on the one hand and abortion on the other. The competing interests are the interest in maternal health and the interest in protecting potential human life. It is now part of our law that the pregnant woman's decision as to which of these conflicting interests shall prevail is entitled to constitutional protection.[1]
In Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, and Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, the Court recognized that the States have a legitimate and protectible interest in potential human life. 410 U.S., at 162. But the Court explicitly held that prior to fetal viability that interest may not justify any governmental burden on the woman's choice to have an abortion[2] nor even any *351 regulation of abortion except in furtherance of the State's interest in the woman's health. In effect, the Court held that a woman's freedom to elect to have an abortion prior to viability has absolute constitutional protection, subject only to valid health regulations. Indeed, in Roe v. Wade the Court held that even after fetal viability, a State may ""regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother."" Id., at 165 (emphasis added). We have a duty to respect that holding. The Court simply shirks that duty in this case.
If a woman has a constitutional right to place a higher value on avoiding either serious harm to her own health or perhaps an abnormal childbirth[3] than on protecting potential life, the exercise of that right cannot provide the basis for the denial of a benefit to which she would otherwise be entitled. The Court's sterile equal protection analysis evades this critical though simple point. The Court focuses exclusively on the ""legitimate interest in protecting the potential life of the fetus."" Ante, at 324. It concludes that since the Hyde Amendments further that interest, the exclusion they create is rational and therefore constitutional. But it is misleading *352 to speak of the Government's legitimate interest in the fetus without reference to the context in which that interest was held to be legitimate. For Roe v. Wade squarely held that the States may not protect that interest when a conflict with the interest in a pregnant woman's health exists. It is thus perfectly clear that neither the Federal Government nor the States may exclude a woman from medical benefits to which she would otherwise be entitled solely to further an interest in potential life when a physician, ""in appropriate medical judgment,"" certifies that an abortion is necessary ""for the preservation of the life or health of the mother."" Roe v. Wade, supra, at 165. The Court totally fails to explain why this reasoning is not dispositive here.[4]
*353 It cannot be denied that the harm inflicted upon women in the excluded class is grievous.[5] As the Court's comparison of the differing forms of the Hyde Amendment that have *354 been enacted since 1976 demonstrates, the Court expressly approves the exclusion of benefits in ""instances where severe and long-lasting physical health damage to the mother"" is the predictable consequence of carrying the pregnancy to term. Indeed, as the Solicitor General acknowledged with commendable candor, the logic of the Court's position would justify a holding that it would be constitutional to deny funding to a medically and financially needy person even if abortion were the only lifesaving medical procedure available.[6] Because a denial of benefits for medically necessary abortions inevitably causes serious harm to the excluded women, it is tantamount to severe punishment.[7] In my judgment, that denial cannot be justified unless government may, in effect, punish women who want abortions. But as the Court unequivocally held in Roe v. Wade, this the government may not do.
*355 Nor can it be argued that the exclusion of this type of medically necessary treatment of the indigent can be justified on fiscal grounds. There are some especially costly forms of treatment that may reasonably be excluded from the program in order to preserve the assets in the pool and extend its benefits to the maximum number of needy persons. Fiscal considerations may compel certain difficult choices in order to improve the protection afforded to the entire benefited class.[8] But, ironically, the exclusion of medically necessary abortions harms the entire class as well as its specific victims. For the records in both McRae and Zbaraz demonstrate that the cost of an abortion is only a small fraction of the costs associated with childbirth.[9] Thus, the decision to tolerate harm to indigent *356 persons who need an abortion in order to avoid ""serious and long-lasting health damage"" is one that is financed by draining money out of the pool that is used to fund all other necessary medical procedures. Unlike most invidious classifications, this discrimination harms not only its direct victims but also the remainder of the class of needy persons that the pool was designed to benefit.
In Maher the Court stated:
""The Constitution imposes no obligation on the States to pay the pregnancy-related medical expenses of indigent women, or indeed to pay any of the medical expenses of indigents. But when a State decides to alleviate some of the hardships of poverty by providing medical care, the manner in which it dispenses benefits is subject to constitutional limitations."" 432 U.S., at 469-470 (footnote omitted).
Having decided to alleviate some of the hardships of poverty by providing necessary medical care, the government must use neutral criteria in distributing benefits. It may not deny benefits to a financially and medically needy person simply because he is a Republican, a Catholic, or an Oriental or because he has spoken against a program the government has a legitimate interest in furthering. In sum, it may not create exceptions for the sole purpose of furthering a governmental interest that is constitutionally subordinate to the individual interest that the entire program was designed to protect. The Hyde Amendments not only exclude financially and medically needy persons from the pool of benefits for a constitutionally insufficient reason; they also require the expenditure of millions and millions of dollars in order to thwart the exercise of a constitutional right, thereby effectively inflicting serious and long-lasting harm on impoverished women who want and need abortions for valid medical reasons. In my judgment, these Amendments constitute an unjustifiable, *357 and indeed blatant, violation of the sovereign's duty to govern impartially.[10]
I respectfully dissent.
"
6053,Justice Rehnquist,dissenting,False,County of Washington v. Gunther,,1981,2.0,"The Court today holds a plaintiff may state a claim of sex-based wage discrimination under Title VII without even establishing that she has performed ""equal or substantially equal work"" to that of males as defined in the Equal Pay Act. Because I believe that the legislative history of both the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Title VII clearly establish that there can be no Title VII claim of sex-based wage discrimination without proof of ""equal work,"" I dissent.

I
Because the Court never comes to grips with petitioners' argument, it is necessary to restate it here. Petitioners argue *182 that Congress in adopting the Equal Pay Act specifically addressed the problem of sex-based wage discrimination and determined that there should be a remedy for claims of unequal pay for equal work, but not for ""comparable"" work. Petitioners further observe that nothing in the legislative history of Title VII, enacted just one year later in 1964, reveals an intent to overrule that determination. Quite the contrary, petitioners note that the legislative history of Title VII, including the adoption of the so-called Bennett Amendment, demonstrates Congress' intent to require all sex-based wage discrimination claims, whether brought under the Equal Pay Act or under Title VII, to satisfy the ""equal work"" standard. Because respondents have not satisfied the ""equal work"" standard, petitioners conclude that they have not stated a claim under Title VII.
In rejecting that argument, the Court ignores traditional canons of statutory construction and relevant legislative history. Although I had thought it well settled that the legislative history of a statute is a useful guide to the intent of Congress, the Court today claims that the legislative history ""has no bearing on the meaning of the [Act],"" ante, at 173, n. 12, ""does not provide a solution to the present problem,"" ante, at 176, and is simply of ""no weight."" Ante, at 176, n. 16. Instead, the Court rests its decision on its unshakable belief that any other result would be unsound public policy. It insists that there simply must be a remedy for wage discrimination beyond that provided in the Equal Pay Act. The Court does not explain why that must be so, nor does it explain what that remedy might be. And, of course, the Court cannot explain why it and not Congress is charged with determining what is and what is not sound public policy.
The closest the Court can come in giving a reason for its decision is its belief that interpretations of Title VII which ""deprive victims of discrimination of a remedy, without clear congressional mandate"" must be avoided. Ante, at 178. But that analysis turns traditional canons of statutory construction *183 on their head. It has long been the rule that when a legislature enacts a statute to protect a class of persons, the burden is on the plaintiff to show statutory coverage, not on the defendant to show that there is a ""clear congressional mandate"" for excluding the plaintiff from coverage. Such a departure from traditional rules is particularly unwarranted in this case, where the doctrine of in pari materia suggests that all claims of sex-based wage discrimination are governed by the substantive standards of the previously enacted and more specific legislation, the Equal Pay Act.
Because the decision does not rest on any reasoned statement of logic or principle, it provides little guidance to employers or lower courts as to what types of compensation practices might now violate Title VII. The Court correctly emphasizes that its decision is narrow, and indeed one searches the Court's opinion in vain for a hint as to what pleadings or proof other than that adduced in this particular case, see ante, at 180-181, would be sufficient to state a claim of sexbased wage discrimination under Title VII. To paraphrase Justice Jackson, the Court today does not and apparently cannot enunciate any legal criteria by which suits under Title VII will be adjudicated and it lays ""down no rule other than our passing impression to guide ourselves or our successors."" Bob-Lo Excursion Co. v. Michigan, 333 U.S. 28, 45 (1948). All we know is that Title VII provides a remedy when, as here, plaintiffs seek to show by direct evidence that their employer intentionally depressed their wages. And, for reasons that go largely unexplained, we also know that a Title VII remedy may not be available to plaintiffs who allege theories different than that alleged here, such as the so-called ""comparable worth"" theory. One has the sense that the decision today will be treated like a restricted railroad ticket, ""good for this day and train only."" Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649, 669 (1944) (Roberts, J., dissenting).
In the end, however, the flaw with today's decision is not so much that it is so narrowly written as to be virtually *184 meaningless, but rather that its legal analysis is wrong. The Court is obviously more interested in the consequences of its decision than in discerning the intention of Congress. In reaching its desired result, the Court conveniently and persistently ignores relevant legislative history and instead relies wholly on what it believes Congress should have enacted.

II

The Equal Pay Act
The starting point for any discussion of sex-based wage discrimination claims must be the Equal Pay Act of 1963, enacted as an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S. C. §§ 201-219 (1976 ed., Supp. III). It was there that Congress, after 18 months of careful and exhaustive study, specifically addressed the problem of sex-based wage discrimination. The Equal Pay Act states that employers shall not discriminate on the basis of sex by paying different wages for jobs that require equal skill, effort, and responsibility. In adopting the ""equal pay for equal work"" formula, Congress carefully considered and ultimately rejected the ""equal pay for comparable worth"" standard advanced by respondents and several amici. As the legislative history of the Equal Pay Act amply demonstrates, Congress realized that the adoption of the comparable-worth doctrine would ignore the economic realities of supply and demand and would involve both governmental agencies and courts in the impossible task of ascertaining the worth of comparable work, an area in which they have little expertise.
The legislative history of the Equal Pay Act begins in 1962 when Representatives Green and Zelenko introduced two identical bills, H. R. 8898 and H. R. 10226 respectively, representing the Kennedy administration's proposal for equal pay legislation. Both bills stated in pertinent part:
""SEC. 4. No employer . . . shall discriminate . . . between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to *185 any employee at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to any employee of the opposite sex for work of comparable character on jobs the performance of which requires comparable skills, except where such payment is made pursuant to a seniority or merit increase system which does not discriminate on the basis of sex."" H. R. 8898, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. (1961); H. R. 10226, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. (1962) (emphasis supplied).[1]
During the extensive hearings on the proposal, the administration strenuously urged that Congress adopt the ""comparable"" language, noting that the comparability of different jobs could be determined through job evaluation procedures. Hearings on H. R. 8898, H. R. 10226 before the Select Subcommittee on Labor of the House Committee on Education and Labor, 87th Cong., 2d Sess., 16, 27 (1962) (testimony of Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg and Assistant Secretary of Labor Esther Peterson). A bill containing the comparable-work formula, then denominated H. R. 11677, was reported out of the House Committee on Education and Labor and reached the full House. Once there, Representative St. George objected to the ""comparable work"" language of the bill and offered an amendment which limited equal pay claims to those ""for equal work on jobs, the performance of which requires equal skills."" 108 Cong. Rec. 14767 (1962). As she explained, her purpose was to limit wage discrimination claims *186 to the situation where men and women were paid differently for performing the same job.
""What we want to do in this bill is to make it exactly what it says. It is called equal pay for equal work in some of the committee hearings. There is a great difference between the word `comparable' and the word `equal'.

.....
"". . . The word `comparable' opens up great vistas. It gives tremendous latitude to whoever is to be arbitrator in these disputes."" Ibid. (Emphasis supplied.)
Representative Landrum echoed those remarks. He stressed that the St. George amendment would prevent ""the trooping around all over the country of employees of the Labor Department harassing business with their various interpretations of the term `comparable' when `equal' is capable of the same definition throughout the United States."" Id., at 14768. The administration, represented by Representatives Zelenko and Green, vigorously urged the House to reject the St. George amendment. They observed that the ""equal work"" standard was narrower than the existing ""equal pay for comparable work"" language and cited correspondence from Secretary of Labor Goldberg that ""comparable is a key word in our proposal."" Id., at 14768-14769. The House, however, rejected that advice and adopted the St. George amendment. When the Senate considered the bill, it too rejected the ""comparable work"" theory in favor of the ""equal work"" standard.
Because the Conference Committee failed to report a bill out of Committee, enactment of equal pay legislation was delayed until 1963. Equal pay legislation, containing the St. George amendment, was reintroduced at the beginning of the session. The congressional debate on that legislation leaves no doubt that Congress clearly rejected the entire notion of ""comparable worth."" For example, Representative *187 Goodell, a cosponsor of the Act, stressed the significance of the change from ""comparable work"" to ""equal work.""[2]
""I think it is important that we have clear legislative history at this point. Last year when the House changed the word `comparable' to `equal' the clear intention was to narrow the whole concept. We went from `comparable' to `equal' meaning that the jobs involved should be virtually identical, that is, that they would be very much alike or closely related to each other.
""We do not expect the Labor Department to go into an establishment and attempt to rate jobs that are not equal. We do not want to hear the Department say, `Well, they amount to the same thing,' and evaluate them so that they come up to the same skill or point. We expect this to apply only to jobs that are substantially identical or equal."" 109 Cong. Rec. 9197 (1963) (emphasis supplied).
Representative Frelinghuysen agreed with those remarks.
""[W]e can expect that the administration of the equal pay concept, while fair and effective, will not be excessive nor excessively wide ranging. What we seek to insure, where men and women are doing the same job under the same working conditions[,] that they will receive the same pay. It is not intended that either the Labor Department or individual employees will be equipped with hunting licenses.
.....
"". . . [The EPA] is not intended to compare unrelated jobs, or jobs that have been historically and normally considered by the industry to be different."" Id., at 9196 (emphasis supplied).[3]
*188 Thus, the legislative history of the Equal Pay Act clearly reveals that Congress was unwilling to give either the Federal Government or the courts broad authority to determine comparable wage rates. Congress recognized that the adoption of such a theory would ignore economic realities and would result in major restructuring of the American economy. Instead, Congress concluded that governmental intervention to equalize wage differentials was to be undertaken only within one circumstance: when men's and women's jobs were identical or nearly so, hence unarguably of equal worth. It defies common sense to believe that the same Congress which, after 18 months of hearings and debates, had decided in 1963 upon the extent of federal involvement it desired in the area of wage rate claimsintended sub silentio to reject all of this work and to abandon the limitations of the equal work approach just one year later, when it enacted Title VII.

Title VII
Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S. C. § 2000a et seq., one year after passing the Equal Pay Act. Title VII prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, and sex. 42 U.S. C. § 2000e-2 (a)(1). The question is whether Congress intended to completely turn its back on the ""equal work"" standard enacted in the Equal Pay Act of 1963 when it adopted Title VII only one year later.
*189 The Court answers that question in the affirmative, concluding that Title VII must be read more broadly than the Equal Pay Act. In so holding, the majority wholly ignores this Court's repeated adherence to the doctrine of in pari materia, namely, that ""[w]here there is no clear intention otherwise, a specific statute will not be controlled or nullified by a general one, regardless of the priority of enactment."" Radzanower v. Touche Ross & Co., 426 U.S. 148, 153 (1976), citing Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 550-551 (1974); United States v. United Continental Tuna Corp., 425 U.S. 164, 169 (1976). In Continental Tuna, for example, the lower court held that an amendment to the Suits in Admiralty Act allowed plaintiffs to sue the United States under that Act and ignore the applicable and more stringent provisions of the previously enacted Public Vessels Act. We rejected that construction because it amounted to a repeal of the Public Vessels Act by implication. We recognized that such an evasion of the congressional purpose reflected in the restrictive provisions would not be permitted absent some clear statement by Congress that such was intended by the later statute. Similarly, in Train v. Colorado Public Interest Research Group, 426 U.S. 1 (1976), this Court rejected a construction of the Federal Water Control Act which would have substantially altered the regulation scheme established under the Atomic Energy Act, without a ""clear indication of legislative intent."" Id., at 24.
When those principles are applied to this case, there can be no doubt that the Equal Pay Act and Title VII should be construed in pari materia. The Equal Pay Act is the more specific piece of legislation, dealing solely with sex-based wage discrimination, and was the product of exhaustive congressional study. Title VII, by contrast, is a general antidiscrimination provision, passed with virtually no consideration of the specific problem of sex-based wage discrimination. See General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125, 143 (1976) (the legislative history of the sex discrimination amendment *190 is ""notable primarily for its brevity"").[4] Most significantly, there is absolutely nothing in the legislative history of Title VII which reveals an intent by Congress to repeal by implication the provisions of the Equal Pay Act. Quite the contrary, what little legislative history there is on the subject such as the comments of Senators Clark and Bennett and Representative Celler, and the contemporaneous interpretation of the EEOCindicates that Congress intended to incorporate the substantive standards of the Equal Pay Act into Title VII so that sex-based wage discrimination claims would be governed by the equal work standard of the Equal Pay Act and by that standard alone. See discussion infra, at 190-197.
In order to the reach the result it so desperately desires, the Court neatly solves the problem of this contrary legislative history by simply giving it ""no weight."" Ante, at 172, n. 12, 176, and n. 16. But it cannot be doubted that Chief Justice Marshall stated the correct rule that ""[w]here the mind labors to discover the design of the legislature, it seizes every thing from which aid can be derived . . . ."" United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch 358, 386 (1805). In this case, when all of the pieces of legislative history are considered in toto, the Court's version of the legislative history of Title VII is barely plausible, say nothing of convincing.
Title VII was first considered by the House, where the prohibition against sex discrimination was added on the House floor. When the bill reached the Senate it bypassed the *191 Senate Committee system and was presented directly to the full Senate. It was there that concern was expressed about the relation of the Title VII sex discrimination ban to the Equal Pay Act. In response to questions by Senator Dirksen, Senator Clark, the floor manager for the bill, prepared a memorandum in which he attempted to put to rest certain objections which he believed to be unfounded. Senator Clark's answer to Senator Dirksen reveals that Senator Clark believed that all cases of wage discrimination under Title VII would be treated under the standards of the Equal Pay Act:
""Objection. The sex antidiscrimination provisions of the bill duplicate the coverage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963. But more than this, they extend far beyond the scope and coverage of the Equal Pay Act. They do not include the limitations in that act with respect to equal work on jobs requiring equal skills in the same establishments, and thus, cut across different jobs.

""Answer. The Equal Pay Act is a part of the wage hour law, with different coverage and with numerous exemptions unlike title VII. Furthermore, under title VII, jobs can no longer be classified as to sex, except where there is a rational basis for discrimination on the ground of bona fide occupational qualification. The standards in the Equal Pay Act for determining discrimination as to wages, of course, are applicable to the comparable situation under title VII."" 110 Cong. Rec. 7217 (1964) (emphasis added).
In this passage, Senator Clark asserted that the sex discrimination provisions of Title VII were necessary, notwithstanding the Equal Pay Act, because (a) the Equal Pay Act had numerous exemptions for various types of businesses, and (b) Title VII covered discrimination in access (e. g., assignment and promotion) to jobs, not just compensation. In addition, Senator Clark made clear that in the compensation area the equal work standard would continue to be the applicable *192 standard. He explained, in answer to Senator Dirksen's concern, that when different jobs were at issue, the Equal Pay Act's legal standardthe ""equal work"" standard would apply to limit the reach of Title VII. Thus Senator Clark rejected as unfounded the objections that the sex provisions of Title VII were unnecessary on the one hand or extended beyond the equal work standard on the other.
Notwithstanding Senator Clark's explanation, Senator Bennett remained concerned that, absent an explicit cross-reference to the Equal Pay Act, the ""wholesale insertion"" of the word ""sex"" in Title VII could nullify the carefully conceived Equal Pay Act standard. 110 Cong. Rec. 13647 (1964). Accordingly, he offered, and the Senate accepted, the following amendment to Title VII:
""It shall not be an unlawful employment practice under this subchapter for any employer to differentiate upon the basis of sex in determining the amount of the wages or compensation paid or to be paid to employees of such employer if such differentiation is authorized by the provisions of [§ 6 (d) of the Equal Pay Act].""
Although the language of the Bennett Amendment is ambiguous, the most plausible interpretation of the Amendment is that it incorporates the substantive standard of the Equal Pay Actthe equal pay for equal work standardinto Title VII. A number of considerations support that view. In the first place, that interpretation is wholly consistent with, and in fact confirms, Senator Clark's earlier explanation of Title VII. Second, in the limited time available to Senator Bennett when he offered his amendmentthe time for debate having been limited by cloturehe explained the Amendment's purpose.[5]
""Mr. President, after many years of yearning by members *193 of the fair sex in this country, and after very careful study by the appropriate committees of Congress, last year Congress passed the so-called Equal Pay Act, which became effective only yesterday.
""By this time, programs have been established for the effective administration of this act. Now when the civil rights bill is under consideration, in which the word `sex' has been inserted in many places, I do not believe sufficient attention may have been paid to possible conflicts between the wholesale insertion of the word `sex' in the bill and in the Equal Pay Act.

""The purpose of my amendment is to provide that in the event of conflicts, the provisions of the Equal Pay Act shall not be nullified."" 110 Cong. Rec. 13647 (1964) (emphasis supplied).
It is obvious that the principal way in which the Equal Pay Act could be ""nullified"" would be to allow plaintiffs unable to meet the ""equal pay for equal work"" standard to proceed under Title VII asserting some other theory of wage discrimination, such as ""comparable worth."" If plaintiffs can proceed under Title VII without showing that they satisfy the ""equal work"" criterion of the Equal Pay Act, one would expect all plaintiffs to file suit under the ""broader"" Title VII standard. Such a result would, for all practical purposes, constitute an implied repeal of the equal work standard of the Equal Pay Act and render that Act a nullity. This was precisely the result Congress sought to avert when it adopted the Bennett Amendment, and the result the Court today embraces.
*194 Senator Bennett confirmed this interpretation just one year later. The Senator expressed concern as to the proper interpretation of his Amendment and offered his written understanding of the Amendment.
""The Amendment therefore means that it is not an unlawful employment practice: . . .(b) to have different standards of compensation for nonexempt employees, where such differentiation is not prohibited by the equal pay amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act.
""Simply stated, the [Bennett] amendment means that discrimination in compensation on account of sex does not violate title VII unless it also violates the Equal Pay Act."" 111 Cong. Rec. 13359 (1965) (emphasis supplied).
Senator Dirksen agreed that this interpretation was ""precisely"" the one that he, Senator Humphrey, and their staffs had in mind when the Senate adopted the Bennett Amendment. Id., at 13360. He added: ""I trust that that will suffice to clear up in the minds of anyone, whether in the Department of Justice or elsewhere, what the Senate intended when that amendment was accepted."" Ibid.[6]
*195 We can glean further insight into the proper interpretation of the Bennett Amendment from the comments of Representative Celler, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and sponsor of Title VII. After the Senate added the Bennett Amendment to Title VII and sent the bill to the House, Representative Celler set out in the record the understanding of the House that sex-based compensation claims would not satisfy Title VII unless they met the equal work standards of the Equal Pay Act. He explained that the Bennett Amendment ""[p]rovides that compliance with the [EPA] satisfies the requirement of the title barring discrimination because of sex[§ 703 (h)]."" 110 Cong. Rec. 15896 (1964). The majority discounts this statement because it is somewhat ""imprecise."" Ante, at 176. I find it difficult to believe that a comment to the full House made by the sponsor of Title VII, who obviously understood its provisions, including its amendments, is of no aid whatsoever to the inquiry before us.[7]
Finally, the contemporaneous interpretations of the Bennett Amendment by the EEOC, which are entitled to great *196 weight since they were issued while the intent of Congress was still fresh in the administrator's mind, further buttresses petitioners' interpretation of the Amendment. Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16 (1965); General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S., at 142. The EEOC interpretations clearly state that the Equal Pay Act's equal work standard is incorporated into Title VII as the standard which must be met by plaintiffs alleging sex-based compensation claims under Title VII. The Commission's 1965 Guidelines on Discrimination Because of Sex explain:
""Title VII requires that its provisions be harmonized with the Equal Pay Act (section 6 (d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S. C. § 206 (d)) in order to avoid conflicting interpretations or requirements with respect to situations to which both statutes are applicable. Accordingly, the Commission interprets section 703 (h) to mean that the standards of `equal pay for equal work' set forth in the Equal Pay Act for determining what is unlawful discrimination in compensation are applicable to Title VII. However, it is the judgment of the Commission that the employee coverage of the prohibition against discrimination in compensation because of sex is coextensive with that of the other prohibitions in section 703, and is not limited by § 703 (h) to those employees covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act."" 29 CFR § 1604.7 (1966). (Emphasis supplied.)
Three weeks after the EEOC issued its Guidelines, the General Counsel explained the Guidelines in an official opinion letter.[8] He explained:
""The Commission, as indicated in § 1604.7 of the *197 Guidelines issued November 24, 1965, 30 F. R. 14928, has decided that section 703 (h), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 incorporates the definition of discrimination in compensation found in the Equal Pay Act, including the four enumerated exceptions . . . ."" General Counsel's opinion of December 29, 1965, App. to Brief for Petitioners 7a. (Emphasis supplied.)
Thus EEOC's contemporaneous interpretation of the Bennett Amendment leaves no room for doubt: The Bennett Amendment incorporates the equal work standard of discrimination into Title VII.[9]
*198 The Court blithely ignores all of this legislative history and chooses to interpret the Bennett Amendment as incorporating only the Equal Pay Act's four affirmative defenses, and not the equal work requirement.[10] That argument does not survive scrutiny. In the first place, the language of the Amendment draws no distinction between the Equal Pay Act's standard for liabilityequal pay for equal workand the Act's defenses. Nor does any Senator or Congressman *199 even come close to suggesting that the Amendment incorporates the Equal Pay Act's affirmative defenses into Title VII, but not the equal work standard itself. Quite the contrary, the concern was that Title VII would render the Equal Pay Act a nullity. It is only too obvious that reading just the four affirmative defenses of the Equal Pay Act into Title VII does not protect the careful draftsmanship of the Equal Pay Act. We must examine statutory words in a manner that ""`reconstitute[s] the gamut of values current at the time when the words were uttered.'"" National Woodwork Manufacturers Assn. v. NLRB, 386 U.S. 612, 620 (1967) (quoting L. Hand, J.). In this case, it stands Congress' concern on its head to suppose that Congress sought to incorporate the affirmative defenses, but not the equal work standard. It would be surprising if Congress in 1964 sought to reverse its decision in 1963 to require a showing of ""equal work"" as a predicate to an equal pay claim and at the same time carefully preserve the four affirmative defenses.
Moreover, even on its own terms the Court's argument is unpersuasive. The Equal Pay Act contains four statutory defenses: different compensation is permissible if the differential is made by way of (1) a seniority system, (2) a merit system, (3) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production, or (4) is based on any other factor other than sex. 29 U.S. C. § 206 (d) (1). The flaw in interpreting the Bennett Amendment as incorporating only the four defenses of the Equal Pay Act into Title VII is that Title VII, even without the Bennett Amendment, contains those very same defenses.[11] The opening sentence of *200 § 703 (h) protects differentials and compensation based on seniority, merit, or quantity or quality of production. These are three of the four EPA defenses. The fourth EPA defense, ""a factor other than sex,"" is already implicit in Title VII because the statute's prohibition of sex discrimination applies only if there is discrimination on the basis of sex. Under the Court's interpretation, the Bennett Amendment, the second sentence of § 703 (h), is mere surplusage. United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 538-539 (1955) (""It is our duty `to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute,' Montclair v. Ramsdell, 107 U.S. 147, 152, rather than emasculate an entire section"").[12] The Court's answer to this argument is curious. It suggests that repetition ensures that the provisions would be consistently interpreted by the courts. Ante, at 170. But that answer only speaks to the purpose for incorporating the defenses in each statute, not for stating the defenses twice in the same statute. Courts are not quite as dense as the majority assumes.
In sum, Title VII and the Equal Pay Act, read together, provide a balanced approach to resolving sex-based wage discrimination claims. Title VII guarantees that qualified female employees will have access to all jobs, and the Equal Pay Act assures that men and women performing the same work will be paid equally. Congress intended to remedy wage discrimination through the Equal Pay Act standards, whether suit is brought under that statute or under Title *201 VII. What emerges is that Title VII would have been construed in pari materia even without the Bennett Amendment, and that the Amendment serves simply to insure that the equal work standard would be the standard by which all wage compensation claims would be judged.

III
Perhaps recognizing that there is virtually no support for its position in the legislative history, the Court rests its holding on its belief that any other holding would be unacceptable public policy. Ante, at 178-180. It argues that there must be a remedy for wage discrimination beyond that provided for in the Equal Pay Act. Quite apart from the fact that that is an issue properly left to Congress and not the Court, the Court is wrong even as a policy matter. The Court's parade of horribles that would occur absent a distinct Title VII remedy simply does not support the result it reaches.
First, the Court contends that a separate Title VII remedy is necessary to remedy the situation where an employer admits to a female worker, hired for a unique position, that her compensation would have been higher had she been male. Ante, at 178-179. Stated differently, the Court insists that an employer could isolate a predominantly female job category and arbitrarily cut its wages because no men currently perform equal or substantially equal work. But a Title VII remedy is unnecessary in these cases because an Equal Pay Act remedy is available. Under the Equal Pay Act, it is not necessary that every Equal Pay Act violation be established through proof that members of the opposite sex are currently performing equal work for greater pay. However unlikely such an admission might be in the bullpen of litigation, an employer's statement that ""if my female employees performing a particular job were males, I would pay them more simply because they are males"" would be admissible in a suit under that Act. Overt discrimination does not go unremedied by the Equal Pay Act. See Bourque v. Powell Electrical *202 Manufacturing Co., 617 F.2d 61 (CA5 1980); Peltier v. City of Fargo, 533 F.2d 374 (CA8 1976); International Union of Electrical Workers v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 631 F.2d 1094, 1108, n. 2 (CA3 1980) (Van Dusen, J., dissenting). In addition, insofar as hiring or placement discrimination caused the isolated job category, Title VII already provides numerous remedies (such as backpay, transfer, and constructive seniority) without resort to job comparisons. In short, if women are limited to low paying jobs against their will, they have adequate remedies under Title VII for denial of job opportunities even under what I believe is the correct construction of the Bennett Amendment.
The Court next contends that absent a Title VII remedy, women who work for employers exempted from coverage of the Equal Pay Act would be wholly without a remedy for wage discrimination. Ante, at 179-180. The Court misapprehends petitioners' argument. As Senator Clark explained in his memorandum, see supra, at 191-192, Congress sought to incorporate into Title VII the substantive standard of the Equal Pay Actthe ""equal work"" standardnot the employee coverage provisions. See supra, at 194-195, n. 6. Thus, to say that the ""equal pay for equal work"" standard is incorporated into Title VII does not mean that employees are precluded from bringing compensation discrimination claims under Title VII. It means only that if employees choose to proceed under Title VII, they must show that they have been deprived of ""equal pay for equal work.""
There is of course a situation in which petitioners' position would deny women a remedy for claims of sex-based wage discrimination. A remedy would not be available where a lower paying job held primarily by women is ""comparable,"" but not substantially equal to, a higher paying job performed by men. That is, plaintiffs would be foreclosed from showing that they received unequal pay for work of ""comparable worth"" or that dissimilar jobs are of ""equal worth."" The short, and best, answer to that contention is that Congress *203 in 1963 explicitly chose not to provide a remedy in such cases. And contrary to the suggestion of the Court, it is by no means clear that Title VII was enacted to remedy all forms of alleged discrimination. We recently emphasized for example, that ""Title VII could not have been enacted into law without substantial support from legislators in both Houses who traditionally resisted federal regulation of private business. Those legislators demanded as a price for their support that `management prerogatives, and union freedoms. . . be left undisturbed to the greatest extent possible.'"" Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193, 206 (1979). See Mohasco Corp. v. Silver, 447 U.S. 807, 820 (1980) (a 90-day statute of limitations may have ""represented a necessary sacrifice of the rights of some victims of discrimination in order that a civil rights bill could be enacted""). Congress balanced the need for a remedy for wage discrimination against its desire to avoid the burdens associated with governmental intervention into wage structures. The Equal Pay Act's ""equal pay for equal work"" formula reflects the outcome of this legislative balancing. In construing Title VII, therefore, the courts cannot be indifferent to this sort of political compromise.

IV
Even though today's opinion reaches what I believe to be the wrong result, its narrow holding is perhaps its saving feature. The opinion does not endorse the so-called ""comparable worth"" theory: though the Court does not indicate how a plaintiff might establish a prima facie case under Title VII, the Court does suggest that allegations of unequal pay for unequal, but comparable, work will not state a claim on which relief may be granted. The Court, for example, repeatedly emphasizes that this is not a case where plaintiffs ask the court to compare the value of dissimilar jobs or to quantify the effect of sex discrimination on wage rates. Ante, at 166, 180-181. Indeed, the Court relates, without criticism, respondents' contention that Lemons v. City and County of *204 Denver, 620 F.2d 228 (CA10), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 888 (1980), is distinguishable. Ante, at 166, n. 7. There the court found that Title VII did not provide a remedy to nurses who sought increased compensation based on a comparison of their jobs to dissimilar jobs of ""comparable"" value in the community. See also Christensen v. Iowa, 563 F.2d 353 (CA8 1977) (no prima facie case under Title VII when plaintiffs, women clerical employees of a university, sought to compare their wages to the employees in the physical plant).
Given that implied repeals of legislation are disfavored, TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 189 (1978), we should not be surprised that the Court disassociates itself from the entire notion of ""comparable worth."" In enacting the Equal Pay Act in 1963, Congress specifically prohibited the courts from comparing the wage rates of dissimilar jobs: there can only be a comparison of wage rates where jobs are ""equal or substantially equal."" Because the legislative history of Title VII does not reveal an intent to overrule that determination, the courts should strive to harmonize the intent of Congress in enacting the Equal Pay Act with its intent in enacting Title VII. Where, as here, the policy of prior legislation is clearly expressed, the Court should not ""transfuse the successor statute with a gloss of its own choosing."" De Sylva v. Ballentine, 351 U.S. 570, 579 (1956).
Because there are no logical underpinnings to the Court's opinion, all we may conclude is that even absent a showing of equal work, there is a cause of action under Title VII where there is direct evidence that an employer has intentionally depressed a woman's salary because she is a woman. The decision today does not approve a cause of action based on a comparison of the wage rates of dissimilar jobs.
For the foregoing reasons, however, I believe that even that narrow holding cannot be supported by the legislative history of the Equal Pay Act and Title VII. This is simply a case where the Court has superimposed upon Title VII a ""gloss of its own choosing.""
"
878,Justice Marshall,second_dissenting,False,Rostker v. Goldberg,,1981,1.0,"The Court today places its imprimatur on one of the most potent remaining public expressions of ""ancient canards about the proper role of women,"" Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U.S. 542, 545 (1971) (MARSHALL, J., concurring). It upholds a statute that requires males but not females to register for the draft, and which thereby categorically excludes women from a fundamental civic obligation. Because I believe the Court's decision is inconsistent with the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection of the laws, I dissent.

I

A
The background to this litigation is set out in the opinion of the Court, ante, at 59-64, and I will not repeat that discussion here. It bears emphasis, however, that the only question presented by this case is whether the exclusion of women from registration under the Military Selective Service Act, 50 U.S. C. App. § 451 et seq. (1976 ed. and Supp. III) (MSSA), contravenes the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Although the purpose of registration is to assist preparations for drafting civilians into the military, we are not asked to rule on the constitutionality of a statute governing conscription.[1] With the advent of the All-Volunteer Armed Forces, the MSSA was specifically amended to preclude conscription as of July 1, 1973, Pub. L. 92-129, § 101 (a) (35), 85 Stat. 353, 50 U.S. C. App. § 467 (c), and reactivation of the draft would therefore require *87 a legislative amendment. See S. Rep. No. 96-826, p. 155 (1980). Consequently, we are not called upon to decide whether either men or women can be drafted at all, whether they must be drafted in equal numbers, in what order they should be drafted, or, once inducted, how they are to be trained for their respective functions. In addition, this case does not involve a challenge to the statutes or policies that prohibit female members of the Armed Forces from serving in combat.[2] It is with this understanding that I turn to the task at hand.

B
By now it should be clear that statutes like the MSSA, which discriminate on the basis of gender, must be examined under the ""heightened"" scrutiny mandated by Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976).[3] Under this test, a gender-based classification cannot withstand constitutional challenge unless the classification is substantially related to the achievement of an important governmental objective. Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U.S. 455, 459, 459-460 (1981); Wengler v. Druggist Mutual Ins. Co., 446 U.S. 142, 150 (1980); Califano v. Westcott, 443 U.S. 76, 84 (1979); Orr v. Orr, 440 U.S. 268, 278 (1979); Craig v. Boren, supra, at 197. This test applies whether the *88 classification discriminates against males or females. Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U.S. 380, 391 (1979); Orr v. Orr, supra, at 278-279; Craig v. Boren, supra, at 204.[4] The party defending the challenged classification carries the burden of demonstrating both the importance of the governmental objective it serves and the substantial relationship between the discriminatory means and the asserted end. See Wengler v. Druggist Mutual Ins. Co., supra, at 151; Caban v. Mohammed, supra, at 393; Craig v. Boren, supra, at 204. Consequently before we can sustain the MSSA, the Government must demonstrate that the gender-based classification it employs bears ""a close and substantial relationship to [the achievement of] important governmental objectives,"" Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 273 (1979).

C
The MSSA states that ""an adequate armed strength must be achieved and maintained to insure the security of this Nation."" 50 U.S. C. App. § 451 (b). I agree with the majority, ante, at 70, that ""[n]o one could deny that . . . the Government's interest in raising and supporting armies is an `important governmental interest.'"" Consequently, the first part of the Craig v. Boren test is satisfied. But the question remains whether the discriminatory means employed itself substantially serves the statutory end. In concluding that it does, the Court correctly notes that Congress enacted (and reactivated) the MSSA pursuant to its constitutional authority to raise and maintain armies.[5] The majority also notes, *89 ante, at 64, that ""the Court accords `great weight to the decisions of Congress,'"" quoting Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, 412 U.S. 94, 102 (1973), and that the Court has accorded particular deference to decisions arising in the context of Congress' authority over military affairs. I have no particular quarrel with these sentiments in the majority opinion. I simply add that even in the area of military affairs, deference to congressional judgments cannot be allowed to shade into an abdication of this Court's ultimate responsibility to decide constitutional questions. As the Court has pointed out:
""[T]he phrase `war power' cannot be invoked as a talismanic incantation to support any exercise of congressional power which can be brought within its ambit. `[E]ven the war power does not remove constitutional limitations safeguarding essential liberties.'"" United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258, 263-264 (1967), quoting Home Bldg. & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398, 426 (1934).
See United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U.S. 81, 88-89 (1921); Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., 251 U.S. 146, 156 (1919); Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 121-127 (1866).
One such ""safeguar[d] [of] essential liberties"" is the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection of the laws.[6] When, as here, a federal law that classifies on the basis of gender is challenged as violating this constitutional guarantee, it is ultimately for this Court, not Congress, to decide whether there exists the constitutionally required ""close and *90 substantial relationship"" between the discriminatory means employed and the asserted governmental objective. See Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 549 (1969); Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 211 (1962). In my judgment, there simply is no basis for concluding in this case that excluding women from registration is substantially related to the achievement of a concededly important governmental interest in maintaining an effective defense. The Court reaches a contrary conclusion only by using an ""[a]nnounced degre[e] of `deference' to legislative judgmen[t]"" as a ""facile abstractio[n]. . . to justify a result."" Ante, at 69, 70.

II

A
The Government does not defend the exclusion of women from registration on the ground that preventing women from serving in the military is substantially related to the effectiveness of the Armed Forces. Indeed, the successful experience of women serving in all branches of the Armed Services would belie any such claim. Some 150,000 women volunteers are presently on active service in the military,[7] and their number is expected to increase to over 250,000 by 1985. See Department of Defense Authorization for Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1981: Hearings on S. 2294 before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., 1657, 1683 (1980) (1980 Senate Hearings); Women in the Military: Hearings before the Military Personnel Subcommittee of the House Committee on Armed Services, 96th Cong., 1st *91 and 2d Sess., 13-23 (1979 and 1980) (Women in the Military Hearings). At the congressional hearings, representatives of both the Department of Defense and the Armed Services testified that the participation of women in the All-Volunteer Armed Forces has contributed substantially to military effectiveness. See, e. g., 1980 Senate Hearings, at 1389 (Lt. Gen. Yerks), 1682 (Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Danzig); Women in the Military Hearings, at 13-23 (Assistant Secretary of Defense Pirie). Congress has never disagreed with the judgment of the military experts that women have made significant contributions to the effectiveness of the military. On the contrary, Congress has repeatedly praised the performance of female members of the Armed Forces, and has approved efforts by the Armed Services to expand their role. Just last year, the Senate Armed Services Committee declared:
""Women now volunteer for military service and are assigned to most military specialties. These volunteers now make an important contribution to our Armed Forces. The number of women in the military has increased significantly in the past few years and is expected to continue to increase."" S. Rep. No. 96-826, p. 157 (1980).
Accord, S. Rep. No. 96-226, p. 8 (1979).[8] These statements thus make clear that Congress' decision to exclude women from registrationand therefore from a draft drawing on the pool of registrantscannot rest on a supposed need to prevent women from serving in the Armed Forces. The justification for the MSSA's gender-based discrimination must *92 therefore be found in considerations that are peculiar to the objectives of registration.
The most authoritative discussion of Congress' reasons for declining to require registration of women is contained in the Report prepared by the Senate Armed Services Committee on the Fiscal Year 1981 Defense Authorization Bill. S. Rep. No. 96-826, supra, at 156-161. The Report's findings were endorsed by the House-Senate Conferees on the Authorization Bill. See S. Conf. Rep. No. 96-895, p. 100 (1980). Both Houses of Congress subsequently adopted the findings by passing the Conference Report. 126 Cong. Rec. 23126, 23261 (1980). As the majority notes, ante, at 74, the Report's ""findings are in effect findings of the entire Congress."" The Senate Report sets out the objectives Congress sought to accomplish by excluding women from registration, see S. Rep. No. 96-826, supra, at 157-161, and this Court may appropriately look to the Report in evaluating the justification for the discrimination.

B
According to the Senate Report, ""[t]he policy precluding the use of women in combat is . . . the most important reason for not including women in a registration system."" S. Rep. No. 96-826, supra, at 157; see also S. Rep. No. 96-226, supra, at 9. In reaffirming the combat restrictions, the Report declared:
""Registering women for assignment to combat or assigning women to combat positions in peacetime then would leave the actual performance of sexually mixed units as an experiment to be conducted in war with unknown riska risk that the committee finds militarily unwarranted and dangerous. Moreover, the committee feels that any attempt to assign women to combat positions could affect the national resolve at the time of mobilization, a time of great strain on all aspects of the Nation's resources."" S. Rep. No. 96-826, supra, at 157.
*93 Had appellees raised a constitutional challenge to the prohibition against assignment of women to combat, this discussion in the Senate Report might well provide persuasive reasons for upholding the restrictions. But the validity of the combat restrictions is not an issue we need decide in this case.[9] Moreover, since the combat restrictions on women have already been accomplished through statutes and policies that remain in force whether or not women are required to register or to be drafted, including women in registration and draft plans will not result in their being assigned to combat roles. Thus, even assuming that precluding the use of women in combat is an important governmental interest in its own right, there can be no suggestion that the exclusion of women from registration and a draft is substantially related to the achievement of this goal.
The Court's opinion offers a different though related explanation of the relationship between the combat restrictions and Congress' decision not to require registration of women. The majority states that ""Congress . . . clearly linked the need for renewed registration with its views of the character of a subsequent draft."" Ante, at 75. The Court also states that ""Congress determined that any future draft, which would be facilitated by the registration scheme, would be characterized by a need for combat troops."" Ante, at 76. The Court then reasons that since women are not eligible for assignment to combat, Congress' decision to exclude them from registration is not unconstitutional discrimination inasmuch as ""[m]en and women, because of the combat restrictions on women, are simply not similarly situated for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft."" Ante, at 78. There is a certain logic to this reasoning, but the Court's approach is fundamentally flawed.
*94 In the first place, although the Court purports to apply the Craig v. Boren test, the ""similarly situated"" analysis the Court employs is in fact significantly different from the Craig v. Boren approach. Compare Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U. S., at 459-460 (employing Craig v. Boren test), with id., at 463 (STEWART, J., concurring in result) (employing ""similarly situated"" analysis). The Court essentially reasons that the gender classification employed by the MSSA is constitutionally permissible because nondiscrimination is not necessary to achieve the purpose of registration to prepare for a draft of combat troops. In other words, the majority concludes that women may be excluded from registration because they will not be needed in the event of a draft.[10]
This analysis, however, focuses on the wrong question. The relevant inquiry under the Craig v. Boren test is not whether a gender-neutral classification would substantially advance important governmental interests. Rather, the question is whether the gender-based classification is itself substantially related to the achievement of the asserted governmental interest. Thus, the Government's task in this case is to demonstrate that excluding women from registration substantially furthers the goal of preparing for a draft of combat troops. Or to put it another way, the Government must show that registering women would substantially impede its efforts to prepare for such a draft. Under our precedents, the Government cannot meet this burden without showing that a gender-neutral statute would be a less effective means of attaining this end. See Wengler v. Druggists Mutual Ins. Co., 446 U. S., at 151. As the Court explained in Orr v. Orr, 440 U. S., at 283 (emphasis added):
""Legislative classifications which distribute benefits and burdens on the basis of gender carry the inherent risk of *95 reinforcing sexual stereotypes about the `proper place' of women and their need for special protection. . . . Where, as here, the [Government's] . . . purposes are as well served by a gender-neutral classification as one that gender classifies and therefore carries with it the baggage of sexual stereotypes, the [Government] cannot be permitted to classify on the basis of sex.""
In this case, the Government makes no claim that preparing for a draft of combat troops cannot be accomplished just as effectively by registering both men and women but drafting only men if only men turn out to be needed.[11] Nor can the Government argue that this alternative entails the additional cost and administrative inconvenience of registering women. This Court has repeatedly stated that the administrative convenience of employing a gender classification is not an adequate constitutional justification under the Craig v. Boren test. See, e. g., Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S., at 198; Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 690-691 (1973).
The fact that registering women in no way obstructs the governmental interest in preparing for a draft of combat troops points up a second flaw in the Court's analysis. The Court essentially reduces the question of the constitutionality of male-only registration to the validity of a hypothetical program for conscripting only men. The Court posits a draft in which all conscripts are either assigned to those specific combat posts presently closed to women or must be available for rotation into such positions. By so doing, the Court is able to conclude that registering women would be no more than a ""gestur[e] of superficial equality,"" ante, at 79, since women are necessarily ineligible for every position to be filled in its hypothetical draft. If it could indeed be guaranteed *96 in advance that conscription would be reimposed by Congress only in circumstances where, and in a form under which, all conscripts would have to be trained for and assigned to combat or combat rotation positions from which women are categorically excluded, then it could be argued that registration of women would be pointless.
But of course, no such guarantee is possible. Certainly, nothing about the MSSA limits Congress to reinstituting the draft only in such circumstances. For example, Congress may decide that the All-Volunteer Armed Forces are inadequate to meet the Nation's defense needs even in times of peace and reinstitute peacetime conscription. In that event, the hypothetical draft the Court relied on to sustain the MSSA's gender-based classification would presumably be of little relevance, and the Court could then be forced to declare the male-only registration program unconstitutional. This difficulty comes about because both Congress[12] and the Court have lost sight of the important distinction between registration and conscription. Registration provides ""an inventory of what the available strength is within the military qualified pool in this country."" Reinstitution of Procedures for Registration Under the Military Selective Service Act: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Manpower and Personnel of the Senate Armed Services Committee, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., 10 (1979) (Selective Service Hearings) (statement of Gen. Rogers). Conscription supplies the military with the personnel needed to respond to a particular exigency. The fact that registration is a first step in the conscription process does not *97 mean that a registration law expressly discriminating between men and women may be justified by a valid conscription program which would, in retrospect, make the current discrimination appear functionally related to the program that emerged.
But even addressing the Court's reasoning on its own terms, its analysis is flawed because the entire argument rests on a premise that is demonstrably false. As noted, the majority simply assumes that registration prepares for a draft in which every draftee must be available for assignment to combat. But the majority's draft scenario finds no support in either the testimony before Congress, or more importantly, in the findings of the Senate Report. Indeed, the scenario appears to exist only in the Court's imagination, for even the Government represents only that ""in the event of mobilization, approximately two-thirds of the demand on the induction system would be for combat skills."" Brief for Appellant 29 (emphasis added). For my part, rather than join the Court in imagining hypothetical drafts, I prefer to examine the findings in the Senate Report and the testimony presented to Congress.

C
Nothing in the Senate Report supports the Court's intimation that women must be excluded from registration because combat eligibility is a prerequisite for all the positions that would need to be filled in the event of a draft. The Senate Report concluded only that ""[i]f mobilization were to be ordered in a wartime scenario, the primary manpower need would be for combat replacements."" S. Rep. No. 96-826, p. 160 (1980) (emphasis added). This conclusion was in keeping with the testimony presented at the congressional hearings. The Department of Defense indicated that in the event of a mobilization requiring reinstitution of the draft, the primary manpower requirement would be for combat troops and support personnel who can readily be deployed into combat. See 1980 Senate Hearings, at 1395 (Principal *98 Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army Clark), 1390 (Lt. Gen. Yerks). But the Department indicated that conscripts would also be needed to staff a variety of support positions having no prerequisite of combat eligibility, and which therefore could be filled by women. Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics) Pirie explained:
""Not only will we need to expand combat arms, and as I said, that is the most pressing need, but we also will need to expand the support establishment at the same time to allow the combat arms to carry out their function successfully. The support establishment now uses women very effectively, and in wartime I think the same would be true."" Registration of Women: Hearing on H. R. 6569 before the Subcommittee on Military Personnel of the House Committee on Armed Services, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., 17 (1980) (1980 House Hearings).
In testifying about the Defense Department's reasons for concluding that women should be included in registration plans, Pirie stated:
""It is in the interest of national security that, in an emergency requiring the conscription for military service of the Nation's youth, the best qualified people for a wide variety of tasks in our Armed Forces be available. The performance of women in our Armed Forces today strongly supports the conclusion that many of the best qualified people for some military jobs in the 18-26 age category will be women."" Id., at 7.
See 1980 Senate Hearings, at 171 (Secretary of the Army Alexander), 182 (Secretary of the Navy Claytor).[13] The Defense *99 Department also concluded that there are no military reasons that would justify excluding women from registration. The Department's position was described to Congress in these terms:
""Our conclusion is that there are good reasons for registering [women]. Our conclusion is even more strongly that there are not good reasons for refusing to register them."" Id., at 1667-1668 (Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Danzig) (emphasis added).
All four Service Chiefs agreed that there are no military reasons for refusing to register women, and uniformly advocated requiring registration of women. The military's position on the issue was summarized by then Army Chief of Staff General Rogers: ""[W]omen should be required to register for the reason that [Marine Corps Commandant] General Wilson mentioned, which is in order for us to have an inventory of what the available strength is within the military qualified pool in this country."" Selective Service Hearings, at 10; see id., at 10-11 (Adm. Hayward, Chief of Naval Operations; Gen. Allen, Air Force Chief of Staff; Gen. Wilson, Commandant, Marine Corps).
*100 Against this background, the testimony at the congressional hearings focused on projections of manpower needs in the event of an emergency requiring reinstitution of the draft, and, in particular, on the role of women in such a draft. To make the discussion concrete, the testimony examined a draft scenario dealing with personnel requirements during the first six months of mobilization in response to a major war in Europe. The Defense Department indicated three constraints on the maximum number of women the Armed Services could use in the event of such a mobilization:
""(1) legislative prohibitions against the use of women in certain military positions, (2) the policy to reserve certain assignments, such as ground combat roles, for men only, and (3) the need to reserve a substantial number of noncombat positions for men in order to provide a pool of ready replacements for ground combat positions."" 1980 House Hearings, at 6 (Assistant Secretary Pirie).
After allowing for these constraints, the Defense Department reached the following conclusion about the number of female draftees that could be absorbed:
""If we had a mobilization, our present best projection is that we could use women in some 80,000 of the jobs that we would be inducting 650,000 people for. The reason for that is because some 80,000 of those jobs, indeed more than 80,000 of those jobs are support related and not combat related.
""We think women could fill those jobs quite well."" 1980 Senate Hearings, at 1688 (Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Danzig).
See id., at 1661, 1665, 1828; 1980 House Hearings, at 6, 16-17 (Assistant Secretary of Defense Pirie).[14] Finally, the Department *101 of Defense acknowledged that amending the MSSA to authorize registration and induction of women did not necessarily mean that women would be drafted in the same numbers as men. Assistant Secretary Pirie explained:
""If women were subject to the draft, the Department of Defense would determine the maximum number of women that could be used in the Armed Forces, subject to existing constraints and the needs of the Military Services to provide close combat fillers and replacements quickly. We estimate that this might require at least 80,000 additional women over the first six months. If there were not enough women volunteers, a separate draft call for women would be issued."" Id., at 6.
See 1980 Senate Hearings, at 1661 (Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Danzig).
This review of the findings contained in the Senate Report and the testimony presented at the congressional hearings demonstrates that there is no basis for the Court's representation that women are ineligible for all the positions that would need to be filled in the event of a draft. Testimony about personnel requirements in the event of a draft established that women could fill at least 80,000 of the 650,000 positions for which conscripts would be inducted. Thus, with respect to these 80,000 or more positions, the statutes and policies barring women from combat do not provide a reason for distinguishing between male and female potential conscripts; the two groups are, in the majority's parlance, ""similarly situated."" As such, the combat restrictions cannot by themselves supply the constitutionally required justification for the MSSA's gender-based classification. Since the classification precludes women from being drafted to fill positions for which they would be qualified and useful, the Government *102 must demonstrate that excluding women from those positions is substantially related to the achievement of an important governmental objective.

III
The Government argues, however, that the ""consistent testimony before Congress was to the effect that there is no military need to draft women."" Brief for Appellant 31 (emphasis in original). And the Government points to a statement in the Senate Report that ""[b]oth the civilian and military leadership agreed that there was no military need to draft women. . . . The argument for registration and induction of women . . . is not based on military necessity, but on considerations of equity."" S. Rep. No. 96-826, p. 158 (1980). In accepting the Government's contention, the Court asserts that the President's decision to seek authority to register women was based on ""equity,"" and concludes that ""Congress was certainly entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers to raise and regulate armies and navies, to focus on the question of military need rather than `equity.'"" Ante, at 80. In my view, a more careful examination of the concepts of ""equity"" and ""military need"" is required.
As previously noted, the Defense Department's recommendation that women be included in registration plans was based on its conclusion that drafting a limited number of women is consistent with, and could contribute to, military effectiveness. See supra, at 97-102. It was against this background that the military experts concluded that ""equity"" favored registration of women. Assistant Secretary Pirie explained:
""Since women have proven that they can serve successfully as volunteers in the Armed Forces, equity suggests that they be liable to serve as draftees if conscription is reinstated."" 1980 House Hearings, at 7.
By ""considerations of equity,"" the military experts acknowledged that female conscripts can perform as well as male conscripts *103 in certain positions, and that there is therefore no reason why one group should be totally excluded from registration and a draft. Thus, what the majority so blithely dismisses as ""equity"" is nothing less than the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection of the laws which ""requires that Congress treat similarly situated persons similarly,"" ante, at 79. Moreover, whether Congress could subsume this constitutional requirement to ""military need,"" in part depends on precisely what the Senate Report meant by ""military need.""
The Report stated that ""[b]oth the civilian and military leadership agreed that there was no military need to draft women."" S. Rep. No. 96-826, supra, at 158. An examination of what the ""civilian and military leadership"" meant by ""military need"" should therefore provide an insight into the Report's use of the term. Several witnesses testified that because personnel requirements in the event of a mobilization could be met by drafting men, including women in draft plans is not a military necessity. For example, Assistant Secretary of Defense Pirie stated:
""It is doubtful that a female draft can be justified on the argument that wartime personnel requirements cannot be met without them. The pool of draft eligible men . . . is sufficiently large to meet projected wartime requirements."" 1980 House Hearings, at 6.
See 1980 Senate Hearings, at 1665 (Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Danzig). Similarly, Army Chief of Staff General Meyer testified:
""I do not believe there is a need to draft women in peacetime. In wartime, because there are such large numbers of young men available, approximately 2 million males in each year group of the draft age population, there would be no military necessity to draft females except, possibly, doctors, and other health professionals *104 if there are insufficient volunteers from people with those skills."" Id., at 749.
To be sure, there is no ""military need"" to draft women in the sense that a war could be waged without their participation.[15] This fact is, however, irrelevant to resolving the constitutional issue.[16] As previously noted, see supra, at 94-95, it is not appellees' burden to prove that registration of women substantially furthers the objectives of the MSSA.[17] Rather, *105 because eligibility for combat is not a requirement for some of the positions to be filled in the event of a draft, it is incumbent on the Government to show that excluding women from a draft to fill those positions substantially furthers an important governmental objective.
It may be, however, that the Senate Report's allusion to ""military need"" is meant to convey Congress' expectation that women volunteers will make it unnecessary to draft any women. The majority apparently accepts this meaning when it states: ""Congress also concluded that whatever the need for women for noncombat roles during mobilization, whether 80,000 or less, it could be met by volunteers."" Ante, at 81. But since the purpose of registration is to protect against unanticipated shortages of volunteers, it is difficult to see how excluding women from registration can be justified by conjectures about the expected number of female volunteers.[18] I fail to see why the exclusion of a pool of persons who would be conscripted only if needed can be justified by reference to the current supply of volunteers. In any event, the Defense Department's best estimate is that in the event of a mobilization requiring reinstitution of the draft, there will not be *106 enough women volunteers to fill the positions for which women would be eligible. The Department told Congress:
""If we had a mobilization, our present best projection is that we could use women in some 80,000 of the jobs we would be inducting 650,000 people for."" 1980 Senate Hearings, at 1688 (Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Danzig) (emphasis added).[19]
Thus, however the ""military need"" statement in the Senate Report is understood, it does not provide the constitutionally required justification for the total exclusion of women from registration and draft plans.

IV
Recognizing the need to go beyond the ""military need"" argument, the Court asserts that ""Congress determined that staffing noncombat positions with women during a mobilization would be positively detrimental to the important goal of military flexibility."" Ante, at 81-82. None would deny that preserving ""military flexibility"" is an important governmental interest. But to justify the exclusion of women from registration and the draft on this ground, there must be a further showing that staffing even a limited number of non-combat positions with women would impede military flexibility. I find nothing in the Senate Report to provide any basis *107 for the Court's representation that Congress believed this to be the case.
The Senate Report concluded that ""military reasons . . . preclude very large numbers of women from serving."" S. Rep. No. 96-826, p. 158 (1980) (emphasis added). The Report went on to explain:
""Military flexibility requires that a commander be able to move units or ships quickly. Units or ships not located at the front or not previously scheduled for the front nevertheless must be able to move into action if necessary. In peace and war, significant rotation of personnel is necessary. We should not divide the military into two groupsone in permanent combat and one in permanent support. Large numbers of non-combat positions must be available to which combat troops can return for duty before being redeployed."" Ibid.

This discussion confirms the Report's conclusion that drafting ""very large numbers of women"" would hinder military flexibility. The discussion does not, however, address the different question whether drafting only a limited number of women would similarly impede military flexibility. The testimony on this issue at the congressional hearings was that drafting a limited number of women is quite compatible with the military's need for flexibility. In concluding that the Armed Services could usefully employ at least 80,000 women conscripts out of a total of 650,000 draftees that would be needed in the event of a major European war, the Defense Department took into account both the need for rotation of combat personnel and the possibility that some support personnel might have to be sent into combat. As Assistant Secretary Pirie testified:
""If women were subject to the draft, the Department of Defense would determine the maximum number of women that could be used in the Armed Forces, subject to existing constraints and the needs of the Military *108 Services to provide close combat fillers and replacements quickly. We estimate that this might require at least 80,000 additional women over the first 6 months."" 1980 House Hearings, at 6 (emphasis added).
See App. 278 (deposition of Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Danzig).[20]
Similarly, there is no reason why induction of a limited number of female draftees should any more divide the military into ""permanent combat"" and ""permanent support"" groups than is presently the case with the All-Volunteer Armed Forces. The combat restrictions that would prevent a female draftee from serving in a combat or combat rotation position also apply to the 150,000-250,000 women volunteers in the Armed Services. If the presence of increasing but controlled numbers of female volunteers has not unacceptably ""divide[d] the military into two groups,"" it is difficult to see how the induction of a similarly limited additional number of women could accomplish this result. In these circumstances, I cannot agree with the Court's attempt to ""interpret"" the Senate Report's conclusion that drafting very large numbers of women would impair military flexibility, as proof that Congress reached the entirely different conclusion that drafting a limited number of women would adversely affect military flexibility.


*109 V
The Senate Report itself recognized that the ""military flexibility"" objective speaks only to the question whether ""very large numbers"" of women should be drafted. For the Report went on to state:
""It has been suggested that all women be registered, but only a handful actually be inducted in an emergency. The committee finds this a confused and ultimately unsatisfactory solution."" S. Rep. No. 96-826, p. 158 (1980).
The Report found the proposal ""confused"" and ""unsatisfactory"" for two reasons.
""First, the President's proposal [to require registration of women] does not include any change in section 5 (a) (1) of the [MSSA], which requires that the draft be conducted impartially among those eligible. Administration witnesses admitted that the current language of the law probably precludes induction of women and men on any but a random basis, which should produce roughly equal numbers of men and women. Second, it is conceivable that the courts, faced with a congressional decision to register men and women equally because of equity considerations, will find insufficient justification for then inducting only a token number of women into the Services in an emergency."" Id., at 158-159 (emphasis in original).
The Report thus assumed that if women are registered, any subsequent draft would require simultaneous induction of equal numbers of male and female conscripts. The Report concluded that such a draft would be unacceptable:
""It would create monumental strains on the training system, would clog the personnel administration and support systems needlessly, and would impede our defense preparations at a time of great national need.
""Other administrative problems such as housing and *110 different treatment with regard to dependency, hardship and physical standards would also exist."" Id., at 159.[21]
See also S. Rep. No. 96-226. p. 9 (1979). Relying on these statements, the majority asserts that even ""assuming that a small number of women could be drafted for noncombat roles. Congress simply did not consider it worth the added burdens of including women in draft and registration plans."" Ante, at 81. In actual fact, the conclusion the Senate Report reached is significantly different from the one the Court seeks to attribute to it.
The specific finding by the Senate Report was that ""[i]f the law required women to be drafted in equal numbers with men, mobilization would be severely impaired because of strains on training facilities and administrative systems."" S. Rep. No. 96-826, supra, at 160 (emphasis added). There was, however, no suggestion at the congressional hearings that simultaneous induction of equal numbers of males and female conscripts was either necessary or desirable. The Defense Department recommended that women be included in registration and draft plans, with the number of female draftees and the timing of their induction to be determined by the military's personnel requirements. See supra, at 100-101.[22] In endorsing this plan, the Department gave no indication that such a draft would place any strains on training and administrative facilities. Moreover, the Director of the Selective Service System testified that a registration and induction *111 process including both males and females would present no administrative problems. See 1980 Senate Hearings, at 1679 (Bernard Rostker); App. 247-248 (deposition of Bernard Rostker).
The Senate Report simply failed to consider the possibility that a limited number of women could be drafted because of its conclusion that § 5 (a) (1) of the MSSA does not authorize drafting different numbers of men and women and its speculation on judicial reaction to a decision to register women. But since Congress was free to amend § 5 (a) (1), and indeed would have to undertake new legislation to authorize any draft, the matter cannot end there. Furthermore, the Senate Report's speculation that a statute authorizing differential induction of male and female draftees would be vulnerable to constitutional challenge is unfounded. The unchallenged restrictions on the assignment of women to combat, the need to preserve military flexibility, and the other factors discussed in the Senate Report provide more than ample grounds for concluding that the discriminatory means employed by such a statute would be substantially related to the achievement of important governmental objectives. Since Congress could have amended § 5 (a) (1) to authorize differential induction of men and women based on the military's personnel requirements, the Senate Report's discussion about ""added burdens"" that would result from drafting equal numbers of male and female draftees provides no basis for concluding that the total exclusion of women from registration and draft plans is substantially related to the achievement of important governmental objectives.
In sum, neither the Senate Report itself nor the testimony presented at the congressional hearings provides any support for the conclusion the Court seeks to attribute to the Report that drafting a limited number of women, with the number and the timing of their induction and training determined by the military's personnel requirements, would burden training and administrative facilities.


*112 VI
After reviewing the discussion and findings contained in the Senate Report, the most I am able to say of the Report is that it demonstrates that drafting very large numbers of women would frustrate the achievement of a number of important governmental objectives that relate to the ultimate goal of maintaining ""an adequate armed strength . . . to insure the security of this Nation,"" 50 U.S. C. App. § 451 (b). Or to put it another way, the Senate Report establishes that induction of a large number of men but only a limited number of women, as determined by the military's personnel requirements, would be substantially related to important governmental interests. But the discussion and findings in the Senate Report do not enable the Government to carry its burden of demonstrating that completely excluding women from the draft by excluding them from registration substantially furthers important governmental objectives.
In concluding that the Government has carried its burden in this case, the Court adopts ""an appropriately deferential examination of Congress' evaluation of [the] evidence,"" ante, at 83 (emphasis in original). The majority then proceeds to supplement Congress' actual findings with those the Court apparently believes Congress could (and should) have made. Beyond that, the Court substitutes hollow shibboleths about ""deference to legislative decisions"" for constitutional analysis. It is as if the majority has lost sight of the fact that ""it is the responsibility of this Court to act as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution."" Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S., at 549. See Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S., at 211. Congressional enactments in the area of military affairs must, like all other laws, be judged by the standards of the Constitution. For the Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and all legislation must conform to the principles it lays down. As the Court has pointed out, ""the phrase `war power' cannot be invoked as a talismanic incantation to support any exercise of *113 congressional power which can be brought within its ambit."" United States v. Robel, 389 U. S., at 263-264.
Furthermore, ""[w]hen it appears that an Act of Congress conflicts with [a constitutional] provisio[n], we have no choice but to enforce the paramount commands of the Constitution. We are sworn to do no less. We cannot push back the limits of the Constitution merely to accommodate challenged legislation."" Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 104 (1958) (plurality opinion). In some 106 instances since this Court was established it has determined that congressional action exceeded the bounds of the Constitution. I believe the same is true of this statute. In an attempt to avoid its constitutional obligation, the Court today ""pushes back the limits of the Constitution"" to accommodate an Act of Congress.
I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.
"
877,Justice White,dissenting,False,Rostker v. Goldberg,,1981,1.0,"I assume what has not been challenged in this casethat excluding women from combat positions does not offend the Constitution. Granting that, it is self-evident that if during mobilization for war, all noncombat military positions must be filled by combat-qualified personnel available to be moved into combat positions, there would be no occasion whatsoever to have any women in the Army, whether as volunteers or inductees. The Court appears to say, ante, at 76-77, that Congress concluded as much and that we should accept that judgment even though the serious view of the Executive Branch, including the responsible military services, is to the contrary. The Court's position in this regard is most unpersuasive. I perceive little, if any, indication that Congress itself concluded that every position in the military, no matter how far removed from combat, must be filled with combat-ready men. Common sense and experience in recent wars, where women volunteers were employed in substantial numbers, belie this view of reality. It should not be ascribed to Congress, particularly in the face of the testimony of military authorities, hereafter referred to, that there would be a substantial *84 number of positions in the services that could be filled by women both in peacetime and during mobilization, even though they are ineligible for combat.
I would also have little difficulty agreeing to a reversal if all the women who could serve in wartime without adversely affecting combat readiness could predictably be obtained through volunteers. In that event, the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment would not require the United States to go through, and a large segment of the population to be burdened with, the expensive and essentially useless procedure of registering women. But again I cannot agree with the Court, see ante, at 81, that Congress concluded or that the legislative record indicates that each of the services could rely on women volunteers to fill all the positions for which they might be eligible in the event of mobilization. On the contrary, the record as I understand it, supports the District Court's finding that the services would have to conscript at least 80,000 persons to fill positions for which combat-ready men would not be required. The consistent position of the Defense Department representatives was that their best estimate of the number of women draftees who could be used productively by the services in the event of a major mobilization would be approximately 80,000 over the first six months. See Hearings on S. 2294 before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., 1681, 1688 (1980); Hearings on H. R. 6569 before the Subcommittee on Military Personnel of the House Committee on Armed Services, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., 16 (1980). This number took into account the estimated number of women volunteers, see Deposition of Director of Selective Service Bernard Rostker 8; Deposition of Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Danzig, App. 276. Except for a single, unsupported, and ambiguous statement in the Senate Report to the effect that ""women volunteers would fill the requirements for women,"" there is no indication that Congress rejected the *85 Defense Department's figures or relied upon an alternative set of figures.
Of course, the division among us indicates that the record in this respect means different things to different people, and I would be content to vacate the judgment below and remand for further hearings and findings on this crucial issue. Absent that, however, I cannot agree that the record supports the view that all positions for which women would be eligible in wartime could and would be filled by female volunteers.
The Court also submits that because the primary purpose of registration and conscription is to supply combat troops and because the great majority of noncombat positions must be filled by combat-trained men ready to be rotated into combat, the absolute number of positions for which women would be eligible is so small as to be de minimis and of no moment for equal protection purposes, especially in light of the administrative burdens involved in registering all women of suitable age. There is some sense to this; but at least on the record before us, the number of women who could be used in the military without sacrificing combat readiness is not at all small or insubstantial, and administrative convenience has not been sufficient justification for the kind of outright gender-based discrimination involved in registering and conscripting men but no women at all.
As I understand the record, then, in order to secure the personnel it needs during mobilization, the Government cannot rely on volunteers and must register and draft not only to fill combat positions and those noncombat positions that must be filled by combat-trained men, but also to secure the personnel needed for jobs that can be performed by persons ineligible for combat without diminishing military effectiveness. The claim is that in providing for the latter category of positions, Congress is free to register and draft only men. I discern no adequate justification for this kind of discrimination *86 between men and women. Accordingly, with all due respect, I dissent."
876,Justice Rehnquist,majority,False,Rostker v. Goldberg,,1981,1.0,"The question presented is whether the Military Selective Service Act, 50 U.S. C. App. § 451 et seq. (1976 ed. and Supp. III), violates the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution in authorizing the President to require the registration of males and not females.

I
Congress is given the power under the Constitution ""To raise and support Armies,"" ""To provide and maintain a Navy,"" and ""To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces."" Art. I, § 8, cls. 12-14. Pursuant to this grant of authority Congress has enacted the Military Selective Service Act, 50 U.S. C. App. § 451 et seq. (1976 ed. and Supp. III) (the MSSA or the Act). Section 3 of the Act, 62 Stat. 605, as amended, 50 U.S. C. App. § 453, empowers the President, by proclamation, to require the registration of ""every male citizen"" and male resident aliens between the ages of 18 and 26. The purpose of this registration is to facilitate any eventual conscription: pursuant to § 4 (a) of the Act, 62 Stat. 605, as amended, 50 U.S. C. App. § 454 (a), those persons required to register under § 3 are liable for *60 training and service in the Armed Forces. The MSSA registration provision serves no other purpose beyond providing a pool for subsequent induction.
Registration for the draft under § 3 was discontinued in 1975. Presidential Proclamation No. 4360, 3 CFR 462 (1971-1975 Comp.), note following 50 U.S. C. App. § 453. In early 1980. President Carter determined that it was necessary to reactivate the draft registration process.[1] The immediate impetus for this decision was the Soviet armed invasion of Afghanistan. 16 Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 198 (1980) (State of the Union Address). According to the administration's witnesses before the Senate Armed Services Committee, the resulting crisis in Southwestern Asia convinced the President that the ""time has come"" ""to use his present authority to require registration . . . as a necessary step to preserving or enhancing our national security interests."" Department of Defense Authorization for Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1981: Hearings on S. 2294 before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., 1805 (1980) (hereafter Hearings on S. 2294) (joint statement of Dr. John P. White, Deputy Director, Office of Management and Budget, Dr. Bernard Rostker, Director, Selective Service System, and Richard Danzig, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense). The Selective Service System had been inactive, however, and funds were needed before reactivating registration. The President therefore recommended that funds be transferred from the Department of Defense to the separate Selective Service System. H. R. Doc. No. 96-267, p. 2 (1980). He also recommended that Congress take action to amend the MSSA to permit the registration and conscription of women as well as men. See House Committee on Armed Services, Presidential Recommendations *61 for Selective Service ReformA Report to Congress Prepared Pursuant to Pub. L. 96-107, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., 20-23 (Comm. Print No. 19, 1980) (hereinafter Presidential Recommendations), App. 57-61.
Congress agreed that it was necessary to reactivate the registration process, and allocated funds for that purpose in a Joint Resolution which passed the House on April 22 and the Senate on June 12. H. J. Res. 521, Pub. L. 96-282, 94 Stat. 552. The Resolution did not allocate all the funds originally requested by the President, but only those necessary to register males. See S. Rep. No. 96-789, p. 1, n. 1, and p. 2 (1980); 126 Cong. Rec. 13895 (1980) (Sen. Nunn). Although Congress considered the question at great length, see infra, at 72-74, it declined to amend the MSSA to permit the registration of women.
On July 2, 1980, the President, by Proclamation, ordered the registration of specified groups of young men pursuant to the authority conferred by § 3 of the Act. Registration was to commence on July 21, 1980. Proclamation No. 4771, 3 CFR 82 (1980).
These events of last year breathed new life into a lawsuit which had been essentially dormant in the lower courts for nearly a decade. It began in 1971 when several men subject to registration for the draft and subsequent induction into the Armed Services filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania challenging the MSSA on several grounds.[2] A three-judge District *62 Court was convened in 1974 to consider the claim of unlawful gender-based discrimination which is now before us.[3] On July 1, 1974, the court declined to dismiss the case as moot, reasoning that although authority to induct registrants had lapsed, see n. 1, supra, plaintiffs were still under certain affirmative obligations in connection with registration. Rowland v. Tarr, 378 F. Supp. 766. Nothing more happened in the case for five years. Then, on June 6, 1979, the court Clerk, acting pursuant to a local rule governing inactive cases, proposed that the case be dismissed. Additional discovery thereupon ensued, and defendants moved to dismiss on various justiciability grounds. The court denied the motion to dismiss, ruling that it did not have before it an adequate record on the operation of the Selective Service System and what action would be necessary to reactivate it. Goldberg v. Tarr, 510 F. Supp. 292 (1980). On July 1, 1980, the court certified a plaintiff class of ""all male persons who are registered or subject to registration under 50 U.S. C. App. § 453 or are liable for training and service in the armed forces of the United States under 50 U.S. C. App. §§ 454, 456 (h) and 467 (c)."" 509 F. Supp. 586, 589.[4]
*63 On Friday, July 18, 1980, three days before registration was to commence, the District Court issued an opinion finding that the Act violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and permanently enjoined the Government from requiring registration under the Act. The court initially determined that the plaintiffs had standing and that the case was ripe, determinations which are not challenged here by the Government. Turning to the merits, the court rejected plaintiffs' suggestions that the equal protection claim should be tested under ""strict scrutiny,"" and also rejected defendants' argument that the deference due Congress in the area of military affairs required application of the traditional ""minimum scrutiny"" test. Applying the ""important government interest"" test articulated in Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976), the court struck down the MSSA. The court stressed that it was not deciding whether or to what extent women should serve in combat, but only the issue of registration, and felt that this ""should dispel any concern that we are injecting ourselves in an inappropriate manner into military affairs."" 509 F. Supp., at 597. See also id., at 599, nn. 17 and 18. The court then proceeded to examine the testimony and hearing evidence presented to Congress by representatives of the military and the Executive Branch, and concluded on the basis of this testimony that ""military opinion, backed by extensive study, is that the availability of women registrants would materially increase flexibility, not hamper it."" Id., at 603. It rejected Congress' contrary determination in part because of what it viewed as Congress' ""inconsistent positions"" in declining to register women yet spending funds to recruit them and expand their opportunities in the military. Ibid.
*64 The Director of Selective Service immediately filed a notice of appeal and the next day, Saturday, July 19, 1980, JUSTICE BRENNAN, acting in his capacity as Circuit Justice for the Third Circuit, stayed the District Court's order enjoining commencement of registration. 448 U.S. 1306. Registration began the next Monday. On December 1, 1980, we noted probable jurisdiction. 449 U.S. 1009.

II
Whenever called upon to judge the constitutionality of an Act of Congress""the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon to perform,"" Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, J.)the Court accords ""great weight to the decisions of Congress."" Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, 412 U.S. 94, 102 (1973). The Congress is a coequal branch of government whose Members take the same oath we do to uphold the Constitution of the United States. As Justice Frankfurter noted in Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 164 (1951) (concurring opinion), we must have ""due regard to the fact that this Court is not exercising a primary judgment but is sitting in judgment upon those who also have taken the oath to observe the Constitution and who have the responsibility for carrying on government."" The customary deference accorded the judgments of Congress is certainly appropriate when, as here, Congress specifically considered the question of the Act's constitutionality. See, e. g., S. Rep. No. 96-826, pp. 159-161 (1980); 126 Cong. Rec. 13880-13882 (1980) (Sen. Warner); id., at 13896 (Sen. Hatfield).
This is not, however, merely a case involving the customary deference accorded congressional decisions. The case arises in the context of Congress' authority over national defense and military affairs, and perhaps in no other area has *65 the Court accorded Congress greater deference. In rejecting the registration of women, Congress explicitly relied upon its constitutional powers under Art. I, § 8, cls. 12-14. The ""specific findings"" section of the Report of the Senate Armed Services Committee, later adopted by both Houses of Congress, began by stating:
""Article I, section 8 of the Constitution commits exclusively to the Congress the powers to raise and support armies, provide and maintain a Navy, and make rules for Government and regulation of the land and naval forces, and pursuant to these powers it lies within the discretion of the Congress to determine the occasions for expansion of our Armed Forces, and the means best suited to such expansion should it prove necessary."" S. Rep. No. 96-826, supra, at 160.
See also S. Rep. No. 96-226, p. 8 (1979). This Court has consistently recognized Congress' ""broad constitutional power"" to raise and regulate armies and navies, Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U.S. 498, 510 (1975). As the Court noted in considering a challenge to the selective service laws: ""The constitutional power of Congress to raise and support armies and to make all laws necessary and proper to that end is broad and sweeping."" United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377 (1968). See Lichter v. United States, 334 U.S. 742, 755 (1948).
Not only is the scope of Congress' constitutional power in this area broad, but the lack of competence on the part of the courts is marked. In Gilligan v. Morgan, 413 U.S. 1, 10 (1973), the Court noted:
""[I]t is difficult to conceive of an area of governmental activity in which the courts have less competence. The complex, subtle, and professional decisions as to the composition, training, equipping, and control of a military force are essentially professional military judgments, *66 subject always to civilian control of the Legislative and Executive Branches.""
See also Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U.S. 83, 93-94 (1953).[5]
The operation of a healthy deference to legislative and executive judgments in the area of military affairs is evident in several recent decisions of this Court. In Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733, 756, 758 (1974), the Court rejected both vagueness and overbreadth challenges to provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, noting that ""Congress is permitted to legislate both with greater breadth and with greater flexibility"" when the statute governs military society, and that ""[w]hile the members of the military are not excluded from the protection granted by the First Amendment, the different character of the military community and of the military mission requires a different application of those protections."" In Middendorf v. Henry, 425 U.S. 25 (1976), the Court noted that in considering due process claims in the context of a summary court-martial it ""must give particular deference to the determination of Congress, made under its authority to regulate the land and naval forces, U. S. Const., Art. I. § 8,"" concerning what rights were available. Id., at 43. See also id., at 49-50 (POWELL, J., concurring). Deference to the judgment of other branches in the area of military affairs also played a major role in Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828, 837-838 (1976), where the Court upheld a ban on political speeches by civilians on a military base, and Brown v. Glines, 444 U.S. 348 (1980), where the Court upheld regulations imposing a prior restraint on the right to petition of military personnel. *67 See also Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137 (1953); United States v. MacIntosh, 283 U.S. 605, 622 (1931).
In Schlesinger v. Ballard, supra, the Court considered a due process challenge, brought by males, to the Navy policy of according females a longer period than males in which to attain promotions necessary to continued service. The Court distinguished previous gender-based discriminations held unlawful in Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), and Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973). In those cases, the classifications were based on ""overbroad generalizations."" See 419 U.S., at 506-507. In the case before it, however, the Court noted:
""[T]he different treatment of men and women naval officers. . . reflects, not archaic and overbroad generalizations, but, instead, the demonstrable fact that male and female line officers in the Navy are not similarly situated with respect to opportunities for professional service. Appellee has not challenged the current restrictions on women officers' participation in combat and in most sea duty."" Id., at 508.
In light of the combat restrictions, women did not have the same opportunities for promotion as men, and therefore it was not unconstitutional for Congress to distinguish between them.
None of this is to say that Congress is free to disregard the Constitution when it acts in the area of military affairs. In that area, as any other, Congress remains subject to the limitations of the Due Process Clause, see Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2 (1866); Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., 251 U.S. 146, 156 (1919), but the tests and limitations to be applied may differ because of the military context. We of course do not abdicate our ultimate responsibility to decide the constitutional question, but simply recognize that the Constitution itself requires such deference to congressional choice. See Columbia Broadcasting System, *68 Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, 412 U. S., at 103. In deciding the question before us we must be particularly careful not to substitute our judgment of what is desirable for that of Congress, or our own evaluation of evidence for a reasonable evaluation by the Legislative Branch.
The District Court purported to recognize the appropriateness of deference to Congress when that body was exercising its constitutionally delegated authority over military affairs, 509 F. Supp., at 596, but it stressed that ""[w]e are not here concerned with military operations or day-to-day conduct of the military into which we have no desire to intrude."" Ibid. Appellees also stress that this case involves civilians, not the military, and that ""the impact of registration on the military is only indirect and attenuated."" Brief for Appellees 19 (emphasis omitted). We find these efforts to divorce registration from the military and national defense context, with all the deference called for in that context, singularly unpersuasive. United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968), recognized the broad deference due Congress in the selective service area before us in this case. Registration is not an end in itself in the civilian world but rather the first step in the induction process into the military one, and Congress specifically linked its consideration of registration to induction, see, e. g., S. Rep. No. 96-826, pp. 156, 160 (1980). Congressional judgments concerning registration and the draft are based on judgments concerning military operations and needs, see, e. g., id., at 157 (""the starting point for any discussion of the appropriateness of registering women for the draft is the question of the proper role of women in combat""), and the deference unquestionably due the latter judgments is necessarily required in assessing the former as well. Although the District Court stressed that it was not intruding on military questions, its opinion was based on assessments of military need and flexibility in a time of mobilization. See, e. g., 509 F. Supp., at 600-605. It would be blinking reality to say that *69 our precedents requiring deference to Congress in military affairs are not implicated by the present case.[6]
The Solicitor General argues, largely on the basis of the foregoing cases emphasizing the deference due Congress in the area of military affairs and national security, that this Court should scrutinize the MSSA only to determine if the distinction drawn between men and women bears a rational relation to some legitimate Government purpose, see U. S. Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166 (1980), and should not examine the Act under the heightened scrutiny with which we have approached gender-based discrimination, see Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County, 450 U.S. 464 (1981); Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976); Reed v. Reed, supra.[7] We do not think that the substantive guarantee of due process or certainty in the law will be advanced by any further ""refinement"" in the applicable tests as suggested by the Government. Announced degrees of ""deference"" to legislative judgments, just as levels of ""scrutiny"" *70 which this Court announces that it applies to particular classifications made by a legislative body, may all too readily become facile abstractions used to justify a result. In this case the courts are called upon to decide whether Congress, acting under an explicit constitutional grant of authority, has by that action transgressed an explicit guarantee of individual rights which limits the authority so conferred. Simply labeling the legislative decision ""military"" on the one hand or ""gender-based"" on the other does not automatically guide a court to the correct constitutional result.
No one could deny that under the test of Craig v. Boren, supra, the Government's interest in raising and supporting armies is an ""important governmental interest."" Congress and its Committees carefully considered and debated two alternative means of furthering that interest: the first was to register only males for potential conscription, and the other was to register both sexes. Congress chose the former alternative. When that decision is challenged on equal protection grounds, the question a court must decide is not which alternative it would have chosen, had it been the primary decisionmaker, but whether that chosen by Congress denies equal protection of the laws.
Nor can it be denied that the imposing number of cases from this Court previously cited suggest that judicial deference to such congressional exercise of authority is at its apogee when legislative action under the congressional authority to raise and support armies and make rules and regulations for their governance is challenged. As previously noted, supra, at 67, deference does not mean abdication. The reconciliation between the deference due Congress and our own constitutional responsibility is perhaps best instanced in Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U. S., at 510, where we stated:
""This Court has recognized that `it is the primary business of armies and navies to fight or be ready to fight wars should the occasion arise.' [U. S. ex rel.] Toth *71 v. Quarles, 350 U.S. 11, 17. See also Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U.S. 83, 94. The responsibility for determining how best our Armed Forces shall attend to that business rests with Congress, see U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cls. 12-14, and with the President. See U. S. Const., Art. II, § 2, cl. 1. We cannot say that, in exercising its broad constitutional power here, Congress has violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.""
Or, as put a generation ago in a case not involving any claim of gender-based discrimination:
""[J]udges are not given the task of running the Army. The responsibility for setting up channels through which . . . grievances can be considered and fairly settled rests upon the Congress and upon the President of the United States and his subordinates. The military constitutes a specialized community governed by a separate discipline from that of the civilian. Orderly government requires that the judiciary be as scrupulous not to interfere with legitimate Army matters as the Army must be scrupulous not to intervene in judicial matters."" Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U. S., at 93-94.
Schlesinger v. Ballard did not purport to apply a different equal protection test because of the military context, but did stress the deference due congressional choices among alternatives in exercising the congressional authority to raise and support armies and make rules for their governance. In light of the floor debate and the Report of the Senate Armed Services Committee hereinafter discussed, it is apparent that Congress was fully aware not merely of the many facts and figures presented to it by witnesses who testified before its Committees, but of the current thinking as to the place of women in the Armed Services. In such a case, we cannot ignore Congress' broad authority conferred by the Constitution to raise and support armies when we are urged to declare *72 unconstitutional its studied choice of one alternative in preference to another for furthering that goal.

III
This case is quite different from several of the gender-based discrimination cases we have considered in that, despite appellees' assertions, Congress did not act ""unthinkingly"" or ""reflexively and not for any considered reason."" Brief for Appellees 35. The question of registering women for the draft not only received considerable national attention and was the subject of wide-ranging public debate, but also was extensively considered by Congress in hearings, floor debate, and in committee. Hearings held by both Houses of Congress in response to the President's request for authorization to register women adduced extensive testimony and evidence concerning the issue. See Hearings on S. 2294; Hearings on H. R. 6569, Registration of Women, before the Subcommittee on Military Personnel of the House Committee on Armed Services, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. (1980) (hereafter House Hearings). These hearings built on other hearings held the previous year addressed to the same question.[8]
The House declined to provide for the registration of women when it passed the Joint Resolution allocating funds for the Selective Service System. See 126 Cong. Rec. 8601-8602, 8620 (1980). When the Senate considered the Joint Resolution, it defeated, after extensive debate, an amendment which in effect would have authorized the registration of women. Id., at 13876-13898.[9] As noted earlier, Congress in *73 H. J. Res. 521 only authorized funds sufficient to cover the registration of males. The Report of the Senate Committee on Appropriations on H. J. Res. 521 noted that the amount authorized was below the President's request ""due to the Committee's decision not to provide $8,500.000 to register women,"" and that ""[t]he amount recommended by the Committee would allow for registration of young men only."" S. Rep. No. 96-789, p. 2 (1980); see 126 Cong. Rec. 13895 (1980) (Sen. Nunn).
While proposals to register women were being rejected in the course of transferring funds to register males, Committees in both Houses which had conducted hearings on the issue were also rejecting the registration of women. The House Subcommittee on Military Personnel of the House Armed Services Committee tabled a bill which would have amended the MSSA to authorize registration of women, H. R. 6569, on March 6, 1980. Legislative Calendar, House Committee on Armed Services, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., 58 (1979-1980). The Senate Armed Services Committee rejected a proposal to register women, S. 2440, as it had one year before, see S. Rep. No. 96-226, pp. 8-9 (1979), and adopted specific findings supporting its action. See S. Rep. No. 96-826, pp. 156-161 (1980). These findings were stressed in debate in the Senate on Joint Resolution 521, see 126 Cong. Rec. 13893-13894 (1980) (Sen. Nunn); id., at 13880-13881 (Sen. Warner). They were later specifically endorsed by House and Senate conferees considering the Fiscal Year 1981 Defense Authorization Bill. See S. Conf. Rep. No. 96-895, p. 100 (1980).[10]*74 Later both Houses adopted the findings by passing the Report. 126 Cong. Rec. 23126, 23261 (1980). The Senate Report, therefore, is considerably more significant than a typical report of a single House, and its findings are in effect findings of the entire Congress.
The foregoing clearly establishes that the decision to exempt women from registration was not the ""'accidental byproduct of a traditional way of thinking about females.'"" Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313, 320 (1977) (quoting Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199, 223 (1977) (STEVENS. J., concurring in judgment)). In Michael M., 450 U. S., at 471, n. 6 (plurality opinion), we rejected a similar argument because of action by the California Legislature considering and rejecting proposals to make a statute challenged on discrimination grounds gender-neutral. The cause for rejecting the argument is considerably stronger here. The issue was considered at great length, and Congress clearly expressed its purpose and intent. Contrast Califano v. Westcott, 443 U.S. 76, 87 (1979) (""The gender qualification . . . escaped virtually unnoticed in the hearings and floor debates"").[11]
For the same reasons we reject appellees' argument that we must consider the constitutionality of the MSSA solely on the basis of the views expressed by Congress in 1948, when the MSSA was first enacted in its modern form. Contrary to the suggestions of appellees and various amici, reliance on the legislative history of Joint Resolution 521 and the activity of the various Committees of the 96th Congress considering the registration of women does not violate sound principles that appropriations legislation should not be considered *75 as modifying substantive legislation. Congress did not change the MSSA in 1980, but it did thoroughly reconsider the question of exempting women from its provisions, and its basis for doing so. The 1980 legislative history is, therefore, highly relevant in assessing the constitutional validity of the exemption.
The MSSA established a plan for maintaining ""adequate armed strength . . . to insure the security of [the] Nation."" 50 U.S. C. App. § 451 (b). Registration is the first step ""in a united and continuous process designed to raise an army speedily and efficiently,"" Falbo v. United States, 320 U.S. 549, 553 (1944), see United States v. Nugent, 346 U.S. 1, 9 (1953), and Congress provided for the reactivation of registration in order to ""provid[e] the means for the early delivery of inductees in an emergency."" S. Rep. No. 96-826, supra, at 156. Although the three-judge District Court often tried to sever its consideration of registration from the particulars of induction, see, e. g., 509 F. Supp., at 604-605, Congress rather clearly linked the need for renewed registration with its views on the character of a subsequent draft. The Senate Report specifically found that ""[a]n ability to mobilize rapidly is essential to the preservation of our national security. . . . A functioning registration system is a vital part of any mobilization plan."" S. Rep. No. 96-826, supra, at 160. As Senator Warner put it, ""I equate registration with the draft."" Hearings on S. 2294, at 1197. See also id., at 1195 (Sen. Jepsen), 1671 (Sen. Exon). Such an approach is certainly logical, since under the MSSA induction is interlocked with registration: only those registered may be drafted, and registration serves no purpose beyond providing a pool for the draft. any assessment of the congressional purpose and its chosen means must therefore consider the registration scheme as a prelude to a draft in a time of national emergency. Any other approach would not be testing the Act in light of the purposes Congress sought to achieve.
*76 Congress determined that any future draft, which would be facilitated by the registration scheme, would be characterized by a need for combat troops. The Senate Report explained, in a specific finding later adopted by both Houses, that ""[i]f mobilization were to be ordered in a wartime scenario, the primary manpower need would be for combat replacements."" S. Rep. No. 96-826, p. 160 (1980); see id., at 158. This conclusion echoed one made a year before by the same Senate Committee, see S. Rep. No. 96-226, pp. 2-3, 6 (1979). As Senator Jepsen put it, ""the shortage would be in the combat arms. That is why you have drafts."" Hearings on S. 2294, at 1688. See also id., at 1195 (Sen. Jepsen); 126 Cong. Rec. 8623 (1980) (Rep. Nelson). Congress' determination that the need would be for combat troops if a draft took place was sufficiently supported by testimony adduced at the hearings so that the courts are not free to make their own judgment on the question. See Hearings on S. 2294, at 1528-1529 (Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Bronars); 1395 (Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Army Clark); 1391 (Lt. Gen. Yerks); 748 (Gen. Meyer); House Hearings 17 (Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower Pirie). See also Hearing on S. 109 and S. 226, at 24,54 (Gen. Rogers). The purpose of registration, therefore, was to prepare for a draft of combat troops.
Women as a group, however, unlike men as a group, are not eligible for combat. The restrictions on the participation of women in combat in the Navy and Air Force are statutory. Under 10 U.S. C. § 6015 (1976 ed., Supp.III), ""women may not be assigned to duty on vessels or in aircraft that are engaged in combat missions,"" and under 10 U.S. C. § 8549 female members of the Air Force ""may not be assigned to duty in aircraft engaged in combat missions."" The Army and Marine Corps preclude the use of women in combat as a matter of established policy. See App. 86, 34, 58. Congress specifically recognized and endorsed the exclusion of women from *77 combat in exempting women from registration. In the words of the Senate Report:
""The principle that women should not intentionally and routinely engage in combat is fundamental, and enjoys wide support among our people. It is universally supported by military leaders who have testified before the Committee . . . . Current law and policy exclude women from being assigned to combat in our military forces, and the Committee reaffirms this policy."" S. Rep. No. 96-826, supra, at 157.
The Senate Report specifically found that ""[w]omen should not be intentionally or routinely placed in combat positions in our military services."" Id., at 160. See S. Rep. No. 96-226, supra, at 9.[12] The President expressed his intent to continue the current military policy precluding women from combat, see Presidential Recommendations 3, App. 34, and appellees present their argument concerning registration against the background of such restrictions on the use of women in combat.[13] Consistent with the approach of this Court in Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U.S. 498 (1975), we must examine appellees' constitutional claim concerning registration with these combat restrictions firmly in mind.
The existence of the combat restrictions clearly indicates the basis for Congress' decision to exempt women from registration. The purpose of registration was to prepare for a draft of combat troops. Since women are excluded from combat, Congress concluded that they would not be needed in the event of a draft, and therefore decided not to register them. Again turning to the Senate Report:
""In the Committee's view, the starting point for any *78 discussion of the appropriateness of registering women for the draft is the question of the proper role of women in combat. . . . The policy precluding the use of women in combat is, in the Committee's view, the most important reason for not including women in a registration system."" S. Rep. No. 96-826, supra, at 157.[14]
The District Court stressed that the military need for women was irrelevant to the issue of their registration. As that court put it: ""Congress could not constitutionally require registration under the MSSA of only black citizens or only white citizens, or single out any political or religious group simply because those groups contain sufficient persons to fill the needs of the Selective Service System."" 509 F. Supp., at 596. This reasoning is beside the point. The reason women are exempt from registration is not because military needs can be met by drafting men. This is not a case of Congress arbitrarily choosing to burden one of two similarly situated groups, such as would be the case with an all-black or all-white, or an all-Catholic or all-Lutheran, or an all-Republican or all-Democratic registration. Men and women, because of the combat restrictions on women, are simply not similarly situated for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft.
Congress' decision to authorize the registration of only men, *79 therefore, does not violate the Due Process Clause. The exemption of women from registration is not only sufficiently but also closely related to Congress' purpose in authorizing registration. See Michael M., 450 U. S., at 472-473 (plurality opinion); Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976); Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971). The fact that Congress and the Executive have decided that women should not serve in combat fully justifies Congress in not authorizing their registration, since the purpose of registration is to develop a pool of potential combat troops. As was the case in Schlesinger v. Ballard, supra, ""the gender classification is not individious, but rather realistically reflects the fact that the sexes are not similarly situated"" in this case. Michael M., supra, at 469 (plurality opinion). The Constitution requires that Congress treat similarly situated persons similarly, not that it engage in gestures of superficial equality.
In holding the MSSA constitutionally invalid the District Court relied heavily on the President's decision to seek authority to register women and the testimony of members of the Executive Branch and the military in support of that decision. See, e. g., 509 F. Supp., at 603-604, and n. 30. As stated by the administration's witnesses before Congress, however, the President's ""decision to ask for authority to register women is based on equity."" House Hearings 7 (statement of Assistant Secretary of Defense Pirie and Director of Selective Service System Rostker); see also Presidential Recommendations 3, 21, 22, App. 35, 59, 60; Hearings on S. 2294, at 1657 (statements of Executive Associate Director of Office of Management and Budget Wellford, Director of Selective Service System Rostker, and Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Danzig). This was also the basis for the testimony by military officials. Id., at 710 (Gen. Meyer), 1002 (Gen. Allen). The Senate Report, evaluating the testimony before the Committee, recognized that ""[t]he argument for registration and induction of women . . . is not based on military *80 necessity, but on considerations of equity."" S. Rep. No. 96-826, p. 158 (1980). Congress was certainly entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers to raise and regulate armies and navies, to focus on the question of military need rather than ""equity.""[15] As Senator Nunn of the Senate Armed Services Committee put it:
""Our committee went into very great detail. We found that there was no military necessity cited by any witnesses for the registration of females.
""The main point that those who favored the registration of females made was that they were in favor of this because of the equality issue, which is, of course, a legitimate view. But as far as military necessity, and that is what we are primarily, I hope, considering in the overall registration bill, there is no military necessity for this."" 126 Cong. Rec. 13893 (1980).
See also House Hearings 20 (Rep. Holt) (""You are talking about equity. I am talking about military"").[16]
Although the military experts who testified in favor of registering women uniformly opposed the actual drafting of *81 women, see, e. g., Hearing on S. 109 and S. 226, at 11 (Gen. Rogers), there was testimony that in the event of a draft of 650,000 the military could absorb some 80,000 female inductees. Hearings on S. 2294, at 1661, 1828. The 80,000 would be used to fill noncombat positions, freeing men to go to the front. In relying on this testimony in striking down the MSSA, the District Court palpably exceeded its authority when it ignored Congress' considered response to this line of reasoning.
In the first place, assuming that a small number of women could be drafted for noncombat roles, Congress simply did not consider it worth the added burdens of including women in draft and registration plans. ""It has been suggested that all women be registered, but only a handful actually be inducted in an emergency. The Committee finds this a confused and ultimately unsatisfactory solution."" S. Rep. No. 96-826, supra, at 158. As the Senate Committee recognized a year before, ""training would be needlessly burdened by women recruits who could not be used in combat."" S. Rep. No. 96-226, p. 9 (1979). See also S. Rep. No. 96-826, supra, at 159 (""Other administrative problems such as housing and different treatment with regard to dependency, hardship and physical standards would also exist""). It is not for this Court to dismiss such problems as insignificant in the context of military preparedness and the exigencies of a future mobilization.
Congress also concluded that whatever the need for women for noncombat roles during mobilization, whether 80,000 or less, it could be met by volunteers. See id., at 160; id., at 158 (""Because of the combat restrictions, the need would be primarily for men, and women volunteers would fill the requirements for women""); House Hearings 19 (Rep. Holt). See also Hearings on S. 2294, at 1195 (Gen. Rogers).
Most significantly, Congress determined that staffing noncombat positions with women during a mobilization would *82 be positively detrimental to the important goal of military flexibility.
"". . . [T]here are other military reasons that preclude very large numbers of women from serving. Military flexibility requires that a commander be able to move units or ships quickly. Units or ships not located at the front or not previously scheduled for the front nevertheless must be able to move into action if necessary. In peace and war, significant rotation of personnel is necessary. We should not divide the military into two groupsone in permanent combat and one in permanent support. Large numbers of non-combat positions must be available to which combat troops can return for duty before being redeployed."" S. Rep. No. 96-826, supra, at 158.
The point was repeated in specific findings, id., at 160; see also S. Rep. No. 96-226, supra, at 9. In sum, Congress carefully evaluated the testimony that 80,000 women conscripts could be usefully employed in the event of a draft and rejected it in the permissible exercise of its constitutional responsibility. See also Hearing on S. 109 and S. 226, at 16 (Gen. Rogers);[17] Hearings on S. 2294, at 1682. The District *83 Court was quite wrong in undertaking an independent evaluation of this evidence, rather than adopting an appropriately deferential examination of Congress' evaluation of that evidence.
In light of the foregoing, we conclude that Congress acted well within its constitutional authority when it authorized the registration of men, and not women, under the Military Selective Service Act. The decision of the District Court holding otherwise is accordingly
Reversed."
6052,Justice Brennan,majority,False,County of Washington v. Gunther,,1981,2.0,"The question presented is whether § 703 (h) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 257, 42 U.S. C. § 2000e-2 (h), restricts Title VII's prohibition of sex-based wage discrimination to claims of equal pay for equal work.

I
This case arises over the payment by petitioner County of Washington, Ore., of substantially lower wages to female *164 guards in the female section of the county jail than it paid to male guards in the male section of the jail.[1] Respondents are four women who were employed to guard female prisoners and to carry out certain other functions in the jail.[2] In January 1974, the county eliminated the female section of the jail, transferred the female prisoners to the jail of a nearby county, and discharged respondents. 20 FEP Cases 788, 790 (Ore. 1976).
Respondents filed suit against petitioners in Federal District Court under Title VII, 42 U.S. C. § 2000e et seq., seeking backpay and other relief.[3] They alleged that they were paid unequal wages for work substantially equal to that performed by male guards, and in the alternative, that part of the pay differential was attributable to intentional sex discrimination.[4] The latter allegation was based on a claim *165 that, because of intentional discrimination, the county set the pay scale for female guards, but not for male guards, at a level lower than that warranted by its own survey of outside markets and the worth of the jobs.
After trial, the District Court found that the male guards supervised more than 10 times as many prisoners per guard as did the female guards, and that the females devoted much of their time to less valuable clerical duties. It therefore held that respondents' jobs were not substantially equal to those of the male guards, and that respondents were thus not entitled to equal pay. 20 FEP Cases, at 791. The Court of Appeals affirmed on that issue, and respondents do not seek review of the ruling.
The District Court also dismissed respondents' claim that the discrepancy in pay between the male and female guards was attributable in part to intentional sex discrimination. It held as a matter of law that a sex-based wage discrimination claim cannot be brought under Title VII unless it would satisfy the equal work standard of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 29 U.S. C. § 206 (d).[5] 20 FEP Cases, at 791. The court therefore permitted no additional evidence on this claim, and made no findings on whether petitioner county's pay scales for female guards resulted from intentional sex discrimination.
The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that persons alleging sex discrimination ""are not precluded from suing under Title VII to protest . . . discriminatory compensation practices"" merely because their jobs were not equal to higher paying jobs held by members of the opposite sex. 602 F.2d 882, 891 (CA9 1979), supplemental opinion on denial of rehearing, 623 F.2d 1303, 1313, 1317 (1980). The court remanded to the District Court with instructions to take evidence on respondents' claim that part of the difference between their rate of pay and that of the male guards is attributable to sex *166 discrimination. We granted certiorari, 449 U.S. 950 (1980), and now affirm.
We emphasize at the outset the narrowness of the question before us in this case. Respondents' claim is not based on the controversial concept of ""comparable worth,""[6] under which plaintiffs might claim increased compensation on the basis of a comparison of the intrinsic worth or difficulty of their job with that of other jobs in the same organization or community.[7] Rather, respondents seek to prove, by direct evidence, that their wages were depressed because of intentional sex discrimination, consisting of setting the wage scale for female guards, but not for male guards, at a level lower than its own survey of outside markets and the worth of the jobs warranted. The narrow question in this case is whether such a claim is precluded by the last sentence of § 703 (h) of Title VII, called the ""Bennett Amendment.""[8]


*167 II
Title VII makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer ""to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's . . . sex . . . ."" 42 U.S. C. § 2000e-2 (a). The Bennett Amendment to Title VII, however, provides:
""It shall not be an unlawful employment practice under this subchapter for any employer to differentiate upon the basis of sex in determining the amount of the wages or compensation paid or to be paid to employees of such employer if such differentiation is authorized by the provisions of section 206 (d) of title 29."" 42 U.S. C. § 2000e-2 (h).
To discover what practices are exempted from Title VII's prohibitions by the Bennett Amendment, we must turn to § 206 (d)the Equal Pay Actwhich provides in relevant part:
""No employer having employees subject to any provisions of this section shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees in such establishment at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishment for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex."" 77 Stat. 56, 29 U.S. C. § 206 (d) (1).
On its face, the Equal Pay Act contains three restrictions pertinent to this case. First, its coverage is limited to those *168 employers subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act. S. Rep. No. 176, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1963). Thus, the Act does not apply, for example, to certain businesses engaged in retail sales, fishing, agriculture, and newspaper publishing. See 29 U.S. C. §§ 203 (s), 213 (a) (1976 ed. and Supp. III). Second, the Act is restricted to cases involving ""equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions."" 29 U.S. C. § 206 (d) (1). Third, the Act's four affirmative defenses exempt any wage differentials attributable to seniority, merit, quantity or quality of production, or ""any other factor other than sex."" Ibid.
Petitioners argue that the purpose of the Bennett Amendment was to restrict Title VII sex-based wage discrimination claims to those that could also be brought under the Equal Pay Act, and thus that claims not arising from ""equal work"" are precluded. Respondents, in contrast, argue that the Bennett Amendment was designed merely to incorporate the four affirmative defenses of the Equal Pay Act into Title VII for sex-based wage discrimination claims. Respondents thus contend that claims for sex-based wage discrimination can be brought under Title VII even though no member of the opposite sex holds an equal but higher paying job, provided that the challenged wage rate is not based on seniority, merit, quantity or quality of production, or ""any other factor other than sex."" The Court of Appeals found respondents' interpretation the ""more persuasive."" 623 F.2d, at 1311. While recognizing that the language and legislative history of the provision are not unambiguous, we conclude that the Court of Appeals was correct.

A
The language of the Bennett Amendment suggests an intention to incorporate only the affirmative defenses of the Equal Pay Act into Title VII. The Amendment bars sex-based wage discrimination claims under Title VII where the *169 pay differential is ""authorized"" by the Equal Pay Act. Although the word ""authorize"" sometimes means simply ""to permit,"" it ordinarily denotes affirmative enabling action. Black's Law Dictionary 122 (5th ed. 1979) defines ""authorize"" as ""[t]o empower; to give a right or authority to act.""[9] Cf. 18 U.S. C. § 1905 (prohibiting the release by federal employees of certain information ""to any extent not authorized by law""); 28 U.S. C. § 1343 (1976 ed., Supp. III) (granting district courts jurisdiction over ""any civil action authorized by law""). The question, then, is what wage practices have been affirmatively authorized by the Equal Pay Act.
The Equal Pay Act is divided into two parts: a definition of the violation, followed by four affirmative defenses. The first part can hardly be said to ""authorize"" anything at all: it is purely prohibitory. The second part, however, in essence ""authorizes"" employers to differentiate in pay on the basis of seniority, merit, quantity or quality of production, or any other factor other than sex, even though such differentiation might otherwise violate the Act. It is to these provisions, therefore, that the Bennett Amendment must refer.
Petitioners argue that this construction of the Bennett Amendment would render it superfluous. See United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 538-539 (1955). Petitioners claim that the first three affirmative defenses are simply redundant of the provisions elsewhere in § 703 (h) of Title VII that already exempt bona fide seniority and merit systems and systems measuring earnings by quantity or quality of production,[10] and that the fourth defense""any other *170 factor other than sex""is implicit in Title VII's general prohibition of sex-based discrimination.
We cannot agree. The Bennett Amendment was offered as a ""technical amendment"" designed to resolve any potential conflicts between Title VII and the Equal Pay Act. See infra, at 173. Thus, with respect to the first three defenses, the Bennett Amendment has the effect of guaranteeing that courts and administrative agencies adopt a consistent interpretation of like provisions in both statutes. Otherwise, they might develop inconsistent bodies of case law interpreting two sets of nearly identical language.
More importantly, incorporation of the fourth affirmative defense could have significant consequences for Title VII litigation. Title VII's prohibition of discriminatory employment practices was intended to be broadly inclusive, proscribing ""not only overt discrimination but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation."" Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971). The structure of Title VII litigation, including presumptions, burdens of proof, and defenses, has been designed to reflect this approach. The fourth affirmative defense of the Equal Pay Act, however, was designed differently, to confine the application of the Act to wage differentials attributable to sex discrimination. H. R. Rep. No. 309, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1963). Equal Pay Act litigation, therefore, has been structured to permit employers to defend against charges of discrimination where their pay differentials are based on a bona fide use of ""other factors other than sex.""[11] Under the Equal *171 Pay Act, the courts and administrative agencies are not permitted to ""substitute their judgment for the judgment of the employer . . . who [has] established and applied a bona fide job rating system,"" so long as it does not discriminate on the basis of sex. 109 Cong. Rec. 9209 (1963) (statement of Rep. Goodell, principal exponent of the Act). Although we do not decide in this case how sex-based wage discrimination litigation under Title VII should be structured to accommodate the fourth affirmative defense of the Equal Pay Act, see n. 8, supra, we consider it clear that the Bennett Amendment, under this interpretation, is not rendered superfluous.
We therefore conclude that only differentials attributable to the four affirmative defenses of the Equal Pay Act are ""authorized"" by that Act within the meaning of § 703 (h) of Title VII.

B
The legislative background of the Bennett Amendment is fully consistent with this interpretation.
Title VII was the second bill relating to employment discrimination to be enacted by the 88th Congress. Earlier, the same Congress passed the Equal Pay Act ""to remedy what was perceived to be a serious and endemic problem of [sex-based] employment discrimination in private industry,"" Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, 417 U.S. 188, 195 (1974). Any possible inconsistency between the Equal Pay *172 Act and Title VII did not surface until late in the debate over Title VII in the House of Representatives, because, until then. Title VII extended only to discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin, see H. R. Rep. No. 914, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 10 (1963), while the Equal Pay Act applied only to sex discrimination. Just two days before voting on Title VII, the House of Representatives amended the bill to proscribe sex discrimination, but did not discuss the implications of the overlapping jurisdiction of Title VII, as amended, and the Equal Pay Act. See 110 Cong. Rec. 2577-2584 (1964). The Senate took up consideration of the House version of the Civil Rights bill without reference to any committee. Thus, neither House of Congress had the opportunity to undertake formal analysis of the relation between the two statutes.[12]
*173 Several Senators expressed concern that insufficient attention had been paid to possible inconsistencies between the statutes. See id., at 7217 (statement of Sen. Clark); id., at 13647 (statement of Sen. Bennett). In an attempt to rectify the problem, Senator Bennett proposed his amendment. Id., at 13310. The Senate leadership approved the proposal as a ""technical amendment"" to the Civil Rights bill, and it was taken up on the floor on June 12, 1964, after cloture had been invoked. The Amendment engendered no controversy, and passed without recorded vote. The entire discussion comprised a few short statements:
""Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, after many years of yearning by members of the fair sex in this country, and after very careful study by the appropriate committees of Congress, last year Congress passed the so-called Equal Pay Act, which became effective only yesterday.
""By this time, programs have been established for the effective administration of this act. Now, when the civil rights bill is under consideration, in which the word `sex' has been inserted in many places, I do not believe sufficient attention may have been paid to possible conflicts between the wholesale insertion of the word `sex' in the bill and in the Equal Pay Act.
""The purpose of my amendment is to provide that in the event of conflicts, the provisions of the Equal Pay Act shall not be nullified.
""I understand that the leadership in charge of the bill have agreed to the amendment as a proper technical correction of the bill. If they will confirm that understand [sic], I shall ask that the amendment be voted on without asking for the yeas and nays.

*174 ""Mr. HUMPHREY. The amendment of the Senator from Utah is helpful. I believe it is needed. I thank him for his thoughtfulness. The amendment is fully acceptable.
""Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.
""We were aware of the conflict that might develop, because the Equal Pay Act was an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Fair Labor Standards Act carries out certain exceptions.
""All that the pending amendment does is recognize those exceptions, that are carried in the basic act.
""Therefore, this amendment is necessary, in the interest of clarification."" Id., at 13647.
As this discussion shows, Senator Bennett proposed the Amendment because of a general concern that insufficient attention had been paid to the relation between the Equal Pay Act and Title VII, rather than because of a specific potential conflict between the statutes.[13] His explanation that the Amendment assured that the provisions of the Equal Pay Act ""shall not be nullified"" in the event of conflict with Title VII may be read as referring to the affirmative defenses of the Act. Indeed, his emphasis on the ""technical"" nature of the Amendment and his concern for not disrupting the ""effective *175 administration"" of the Equal Pay Act are more compatible with an interpretation of the Amendment as incorporating the Act's affirmative defenses, as administratively interpreted, than as engrafting all the restrictive features of the Equal Pay Act onto Title VII.[14]
Senator Dirksen's comment that all that the Bennett Amendment does is to ""recognize"" the exceptions carried in the Fair Labor Standards Act, suggests that the Bennett Amendment was necessary because of the exceptions to coverage in the Fair Labor Standards Act, which made the Equal Pay Act applicable to a narrower class of employers than was Title VII. See supra, at 167-168. The Bennett Amendment clarified that the standards of the Equal Pay Act would govern even those wage discrimination cases where only Title VII would otherwise apply. So understood, Senator Dirksen's remarks are not inconsistent with our interpretation.[15]
*176 Although there was no debate on the Bennett Amendment in the House of Representatives when the Senate version of the Act returned for final approval, Representative Celler explained each of the Senate's amendments immediately prior to the vote. He stated that the Bennett Amendment ""[p]rovides that compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act as amended satisfies the requirement of the title barring discrimination because of sex . . . ."" 110 Cong. Rec. 15896 (1964). If taken literally, this explanation would restrict Title VII's coverage of sex discrimination more severely than even petitioners suggest: not only would it confine wage discrimination claims to those actionable under the Equal Pay Act, but it would block all other sex discrimination claims as well. We can only conclude that Representative Celler's explanation was not intended to be precise, and does not provide a solution to the present problem.[16]
Thus, although the few references by Members of Congress to the Bennett Amendment do not explicitly confirm that its purpose was to incorporate into Title VII the four affirmative defenses of the Equal Pay Act in sex-based wage discrimination cases, they are broadly consistent with such a reading, and do not support an alternative reading.


*177 C
The interpretations of the Bennett Amendment by the agency entrusted with administration of Title VIIthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commissiondo not provide much guidance in this case. Cf. Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S., at 433-434. The Commission's 1965 Guidelines on Discrimination Because of Sex stated that ""the standards of `equal pay for equal work' set forth in the Equal Pay Act for determining what is unlawful discrimination in compensation are applicable to Title VII."" 29 CFR § 1604.7 (a) (1966). In 1972, the EEOC deleted this portion of the Guideline, see 37 Fed. Reg. 6837 (1972). Although the original Guideline may be read to support petitioners' argument that no claim of sex discrimination in compensation may be brought under Title VII except where the Equal Pay Act's ""equal work"" standard is met, EEOC practice under this Guideline was considerably less than steadfast.
The restrictive interpretation suggested by the 1965 Guideline was followed in several opinion letters in the following years.[17] During the same period, however, EEOC decisions frequently adopted the opposite position. For example, a reasonable-cause determination issued by the Commission in 1968 stated that ""the existence of separate and different wage rate schedules for male employees on the one hand, and female employees on the other doing reasonably comparable work, establishes discriminatory wage rates based solely on the sex of the workers."" Harrington v. Picadilly Cafeteria, Case No. AU 7-3-173 (Apr. 25, 1968).[18]
*178 The current Guideline does not purport to explain whether the equal work standard of the Equal Pay Act has any application to Title VII, see 29 CFR § 1604.8 (1980), but the EEOC now supports respondents' position in its capacity as amicus curiae. In light of this history, we feel no hesitation in adopting what seems to us the most persuasive interpretation of the Amendment, in lieu of that once espoused, but not consistently followed, by the Commission.

D
Our interpretation of the Bennett Amendment draws additional support from the remedial purposes of Title VII and the Equal Pay Act. Section 703 (a) of Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer ""to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment"" because of such individual's sex. 42 U.S. C. § 2000e-2 (a) (emphasis added). As Congress itself has indicated, a ""broad approach"" to the definition of equal employment opportunity is essential to overcoming and undoing the effect of discrimination. S. Rep. No. 867, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 12 (1964). We must therefore avoid interpretations of Title VII that deprive victims of discrimination of a remedy, without clear congressional mandate.
Under petitioners' reading of the Bennett Amendment, only those sex-based wage discrimination claims that satisfy the ""equal work"" standard of the Equal Pay Act could be brought under Title VII. In practical terms, this means that a woman who is discriminatorily underpaid could obtain no reliefno matter how egregious the discrimination might beunless her employer also employed a man in an equal job in the same establishment, at a higher rate of pay. Thus, if *179 an employer hired a woman for a unique position in the company and then admitted that her salary would have been higher had she been male, the woman would be unable to obtain legal redress under petitioners' interpretation. Similarly, if an employer used a transparently sex-biased system for wage determination, women holding jobs not equal to those held by men would be denied the right to prove that the system is a pretext for discrimination. Moreover, to cite an example arising from a recent case, Los Angeles Dept. of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702 (1978), if the employer required its female workers to pay more into its pension program than male workers were required to pay, the only women who could bring a Title VII action under petitioners' interpretation would be those who could establish that a man performed equal work: a female auditor thus might have a cause of action while a female secretary might not. Congress surely did not intend the Bennett Amendment to insulate such blatantly discriminatory practices from judicial redress under Title VII.[19]
Moreover, petitioners' interpretation would have other farreaching consequences. Since it rests on the proposition that any wage differentials not prohibited by the Equal Pay Act are ""authorized"" by it, petitioners' interpretation would lead to the conclusion that discriminatory compensation by employers not covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act is ""authorized""since not prohibitedby the Equal Pay Act. Thus it would deny Title VII protection against sex-based wage discrimination by those employers not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act but covered by Title VII. See supra, at 167-168. There is no persuasive evidence that Congress *180 intended such a result, and the EEOC has rejected it since at least 1965. See 29 CFR § 1604.7 (1966). Indeed, petitioners themselves apparently acknowledge that Congress intended Title VII's broader coverage to apply to equal pay claims under Title VII, thus impliedly admitting the fallacy in their own argument. Brief for Petitioners 48.
Petitioners' reading is thus flatly inconsistent with our past interpretations of Title VII as ""prohibit[ing] all practices in whatever form which create inequality in employment opportunity due to discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin."" Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U.S. 747, 763 (1976). As we said in Los Angeles Dept. of Water & Power v. Manhart, supra, at 707, n. 13: ""In forbidding employers to discriminate against individuals because of their sex, Congress intended to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women resulting from sex stereotypes."" (Emphasis added.) We must therefore reject petitioners' interpretation of the Bennett Amendment.

III
Petitioners argue strenuously that the approach of the Court of Appeals places ""the pay structure of virtually every employer and the entire economy . . . at risk and subject to scrutiny by the federal courts."" Brief for Petitioners 99-100. They raise the specter that ""Title VII plaintiffs could draw any type of comparison imaginable concerning job duties and pay between any job predominantly performed by women and any job predominantly performed by men."" Id., at 101. But whatever the merit of petitioners' arguments in other contexts, they are inapplicable here, for claims based on the type of job comparisons petitioners describe are manifestly different from respondents' claim. Respondents contend that the Country of Washington evaluated the worth of their jobs; that the county determined that they should be paid approximately 95% as much as the male correctional officers; that it paid them only about 70% as much, while paying the male *181 officers the full evaluated worth of their jobs; and that the failure of the county to pay respondents the full evaluated worth of their jobs can be proved to be attributable to intentional sex discrimination. Thus, respondents' suit does not require a court to make its own subjective assessment of the value of the male and female guard jobs, or to attempt by statistical technique or other method to quantify the effect of sex discrimination on the wage rates.[20]
We do not decide in this case the precise contours of law-suits challenging sex discrimination in compensation under Title VII. It is sufficient to note that respondents' claims of discriminatory undercompensation are not barred by § 703 (h) of Title VII merely because respondents do not perform work equal to that of male jail guards. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore
Affirmed."
19858,Justice Brennan,majority,False,Roberts v. United States Jaycees,,1984,1.0,"This case requires us to address a conflict between a State's efforts to eliminate gender-based discrimination against its citizens and the constitutional freedom of association asserted by members of a private organization. In the decision under review, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit concluded that, by requiring the United States Jaycees to admit women as full voting members, the Minnesota Human Rights Act violates the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the organization's members. We noted probable jurisdiction, Gomez-Bethke v. United States Jaycees, 464 U.S. 1037 (1984), and now reverse.

A
The United States Jaycees (Jaycees), founded in 1920 as the Junior Chamber of Commerce, is a nonprofit membership corporation, incorporated in Missouri with national headquarters in Tulsa, Okla. The objective of the Jaycees, as set out in its bylaws, is to pursue
""such educational and charitable purposes as will promote and foster the growth and development of young men's civic organizations in the United States, designed to inculcate in the individual membership of such organization a spirit of genuine Americanism and civic interest, *613 and as a supplementary education institution to provide them with opportunity for personal development and achievement and an avenue for intelligent participation by young men in the affairs of their community, state and nation, and to develop true friendship and understanding among young men of all nations."" Quoted in Brief for Appellee 2.
The organization's bylaws establish seven classes of membership, including individual or regular members, associate individual members, and local chapters. Regular membership is limited to young men between the ages of 18 and 35, while associate membership is available to individuals or groups ineligible for regular membership, principally women and older men. An associate members, whose dues are somewhat lower than those charged regular members, may not vote, hold local or national office, or participate in certain leadership training and awards programs. The bylaws define a local chapter as ""[a]ny young men's organization of good repute existing in any community within the United States, organized for purposes similar to and consistent with those"" of the national organization. App. to Juris. Statement A98. The ultimate policymaking authority of the Jaycees rests with an annual national convention, consisting of delegates from each local chapter, with a national president and board of directors. At the time of trial in August 1981, the Jaycees had approximately 295,000 members in 7,400 local chapters affiliated with 51 state organizations. There were at that time about 11,915 associate members. The national organization's executive vice president estimated at trial that women associate members make up about two percent of the Jaycees' total membership. Tr. 56.
New members are recruited to the Jaycees through the local chapters, although the state and national organizations are also actively involved in recruitment through a variety of promotional activities. A new regular member pays an initial fee followed by annual dues; in exchange, he is entitled *614 to participate in all of the activities of the local, state, and national organizations. The national headquarters employs a staff to develop ""program kits"" for use by local chapters that are designed to enhance individual development, community development, and members' management skills. These materials include courses in public speaking and personal finances as well as community programs related to charity, sports, and public health. The national office also makes available to members a range of personal products, including travel accessories, casual wear, pins, awards, and other gifts. The programs, products, and other activities of the organization are all regularly featured in publications made available to the membership, including a magazine entitled ""Future.""

B
In 1974 and 1975, respectively, the Minneapolis and St. Paul chapters of the Jaycees began admitting women as regular members. Currently, the memberships and boards of directors of both chapters include a substantial proportion of women. As a result, the two chapters have been in violation of the national organization's bylaws for about 10 years. The national organization has imposed a number of sanctions on the Minneapolis and St. Paul chapters for violating the bylaws, including denying their members eligibility for state or national office or awards programs, and refusing to count their membership in computing votes at national conventions.
In December 1978, the president of the national organization advised both chapters that a motion to revoke their charters would be considered at a forthcoming meeting of the national board of directors in Tulsa. Shortly after receiving this notification, members of both chapters filed charges of discrimination with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights. The complaints alleged that the exclusion of women from full membership required by the national organization's bylaws violated the Minnesota Human Rights Act (Act), which provides in part:

*615 ""It is an unfair discriminatory practice:
""To deny any person the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of a place of public accommodation because of race, color, creed, religion, disability, national origin or sex."" Minn. Stat. § 363.03, subd. 3 (1982).
The term ""place of public accommodation"" is defined in the Act as ""a business, accommodation, refreshment, entertainment, recreation, or transportation facility of any kind, whether licensed or not, whose goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations are extended, offered, sold, or otherwise made available to the public."" § 363.01, subd. 18.
After an investigation, the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights found probable cause to believe that the sanctions imposed on the local chapters by the national organization violated the statute and ordered that an evidentiary hearing be held before a state hearing examiner. Before that hearing took place, however, the national organization brought suit against various state officials, appellants here, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the Act. The complaint alleged that, by requiring the organization to accept women as regular members, application of the Act would violate the male members' constitutional rights of free speech and association. With the agreement of the parties, the District Court dismissed the suit without prejudice, stating that it could be renewed in the event the state administrative proceeding resulted in a ruling adverse to the Jaycees.
The proceeding before the Minnesota Human Rights Department hearing examiner then went forward and, upon its completion, the examiner filed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The examiner concluded that the Jaycees organization is a ""place of public accommodation"" within the Act and that it had engaged in an unfair discriminatory practice *616 by excluding women from regular membership. He ordered the national organization to cease and desist from discriminating against any member or applicant for membership on the basis of sex and from imposing sanctions on any Minnesota affiliate for admitting women. Minnesota v. United States Jaycees, No. HR-79-014-GB (Minn. Office of Hearing Examiners for the Dept. of Human Rights, Oct. 9, 1979) (hereinafter Report), App. to Juris. Statement A107-A109. The Jaycees then filed a renewed complaint in the District Court, which in turn certified to the Minnesota Supreme Court the question whether the Jaycees organization is a ""place of public accommodation"" within the meaning of the State's Human Rights Act. See App. 32.
With the record of the administrative hearing before it, the Minnesota Supreme Court answered that question in the affirmative. United States Jaycees v. McClure, 305 N.W.2d 764 (1981). Based on the Act's legislative history, the court determined that the statute is applicable to any ""public business facility."" Id., at 768. It then concluded that the Jaycees organization (a) is a ""business"" in that it sells goods and extends privileges in exchange for annual membership dues; (b) is a ""public"" business in that it solicits and recruits dues-paying members based on unselective criteria; and (c) is a public business ""facility"" in that it conducts its activities at fixed and mobile sites within the State of Minnesota. Id., at 768-774.
Subsequently, the Jaycees amended its complaint in the District Court to add a claim that the Minnesota Supreme Court's interpretation of the Act rendered it unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The federal suit then proceeded to trial, after which the District Court entered judgment in favor of the state officials. United States Jaycees v. McClure, 534 F. Supp. 766 (1982). On appeal, a divided Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed. United States Jaycees v. McClure, 709 F.2d 1560 (1983). The Court of Appeals determined that, because ""the advocacy of political *617 and public causes, selected by the membership, is a not insubstantial part of what [the Jaycees] does,"" the organization's right to select its members is protected by the freedom of association guaranteed by the First Amendment. Id., at 1570. It further decided that application of the Minnesota statute to the Jaycees' membership policies would produce a ""direct and substantial"" interference with that freedom, id., at 1572, because it would necessarily result in ""some change in the Jaycees' philosophical cast,"" id., at 1571, and would attach penal sanctions to those responsible for maintaining the policy, id., at 1572. The court concluded that the State's interest in eradicating discrimination is not sufficiently compelling to outweigh this interference with the Jaycees' constitutional rights, because the organization is not wholly ""public,"" id., at 1571-1572, 1573, the state interest had been asserted selectively, id., at 1573, and the antidiscrimination policy could be served in a number of ways less intrusive of First Amendment freedoms, id., at 1573-1574.
Finally, the court held, in the alternative, that the Minnesota statute is vague as construed and applied and therefore unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In support of this conclusion, the court relied on a statement in the opinion of the Minnesota Supreme Court suggesting that, unlike the Jaycees, the Kiwanis Club is ""private"" and therefore not subject to the Act. By failing to provide any criteria that distinguish such ""private"" organizations from the ""public accommodations"" covered by the statute, the Court of Appeals reasoned, the Minnesota Supreme Court's interpretation rendered the Act unconstitutionally vague. Id., at 1576-1578.

II
Our decisions have referred to constitutionally protected ""freedom of association"" in two distinct senses. In one line of decisions, the Court has concluded that choices to enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships must *618 be secured against undue intrusion by the State because of the role of such relationships in safeguarding the individual freedom that is central to our constitutional scheme. In this respect, freedom of association receives protection as a fundamental element of personal liberty. In another set of decisions, the Court has recognized a right to associate for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First Amendment  speech, assembly, petition for the redress of grievances, and the exercise of religion. The Constitution guarantees freedom of association of this kind as an indispensable means of preserving other individual liberties.
The intrinsic and instrumental features of constitutionally protected association may, of course, coincide. In particular, when the State interferes with individuals' selection of those with whom they wish to join in a common endeavor, freedom of association in both of its forms may be implicated. The Jaycees contend that this is such a case. Still, the nature and degree of constitutional protection afforded freedom of association may vary depending on the extent to which one or the other aspect of the constitutionally protected liberty is at stake in a given case. We therefore find it useful to consider separately the effect of applying the Minnesota statute to the Jaycees on what could be called its members' freedom of intimate association and their freedom of expressive association.

A
The Court has long recognized that, because the Bill of Rights is designed to secure individual liberty, it must afford the formation and preservation of certain kinds of highly personal relationships a substantial measure of sanctuary from unjustified interference by the State. E. g., Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 534-535 (1925); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 (1923). Without precisely identifying every consideration that may underlie this type of constitutional protection, we have noted that certain kinds of personal bonds have played a critical role in the culture *619 and traditions of the Nation by cultivating and transmitting shared ideals and beliefs; they thereby foster diversity and act as critical buffers between the individual and the power of the State. See, e. g., Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 383-386 (1978); Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503-504 (1977) (plurality opinion); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 232 (1972); Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 482-485 (1965); Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra, at 535. See also Gilmore v. City of Montgomery, 417 U.S. 556, 575 (1974); NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 460-462 (1958); Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 542-545 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting). Moreover, the constitutional shelter afforded such relationships reflects the realization that individuals draw much of their emotional enrichment from close ties with others. Protecting these relationships from unwarranted state interference therefore safeguards the ability independently to define one's identity that is central to any concept of liberty. See, e. g., Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U.S. 246, 255 (1978); Smith v. Organization of Foster Families, 431 U.S. 816, 844 (1977); Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U.S. 678, 684-686 (1977); Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, 414 U.S. 632, 639-640 (1974); Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651-652 (1972); Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 564 (1969); Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).
The personal affiliations that exemplify these considerations, and that therefore suggest some relevant limitations on the relationships that might be entitled to this sort of constitutional protection, are those that attend the creation and sustenance of a family  marriage, e. g., Zablocki v. Redhail, supra; childbirth, e. g., Carey v. Population Services International, supra; the raising and education of children, e. g., Smith v. Organization of Foster Families, supra; and cohabitation with one's relatives, e. g., Moore v. East Cleveland, supra. Family relationships, by their nature, involve *620 deep attachments and commitments to the necessarily few other individuals with whom one shares not only a special community of thoughts, experiences, and beliefs but also distinctively personal aspects of one's life. Among other things, therefore, they are distinguished by such attributes as relative smallness, a high degree of selectivity in decisions to begin and maintain the affiliation, and seclusion from others in critical aspects of the relationship. As a general matter, only relationships with these sorts of qualities are likely to reflect the considerations that have led to an understanding of freedom of association as an intrinsic element of personal liberty. Conversely, an association lacking these qualities  such as a large business enterprise  seems remote from the concerns giving rise to this constitutional protection. Accordingly, the Constitution undoubtedly imposes constraints on the State's power to control the selection of one's spouse that would not apply to regulations affecting the choice of one's fellow employees. Compare Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967), with Railway Mail Assn. v. Corsi, 326 U.S. 88, 93-94 (1945).
Between these poles, of course, lies a broad range of human relationships that may make greater or lesser claims to constitutional protection from particular incursions by the State. Determining the limits of state authority over an individual's freedom to enter into a particular association therefore unavoidably entails a careful assessment of where that relationship's objective characteristics locate it on a spectrum from the most intimate to the most attenuated of personal attachments. See generally Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 187-189 (1976) (POWELL, J., concurring). We need not mark the potentially significant points on this terrain with any precision. We note only that factors that may be relevant include size, purpose, policies, selectivity, congeniality, and other characteristics that in a particular case may be pertinent. In this case, however, several features of the Jaycees clearly place the organization outside of the category of relationships worthy of this kind of constitutional protection.
*621 The undisputed facts reveal that the local chapters of the Jaycees are large and basically unselective groups. At the time of the state administrative hearing, the Minneapolis chapter had approximately 430 members, while the St. Paul chapter had about 400. Report, App. to Juris. Statement A-99, A-100. Apart from age and sex, neither the national organization nor the local chapters employ any criteria for judging applicants for membership, and new members are routinely recruited and admitted with no inquiry into their backgrounds. See 1 Tr. of State Administrative Hearing 124-132, 135-136, 174-176. In fact, a local officer testified that he could recall no instance in which an applicant had been denied membership on any basis other than age or sex. Id., at 135. Cf. Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Assn., Inc., 410 U.S. 431, 438 91973) (organization whose only selection criterion is race has ""no plan or purpose of exclusiveness"" that might make it a private club exempt from federal civil rights statute); Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U.S. 229, 236 (1969) (same); Daniel v. Paul, 395 U.S. 298, 302 (1969) (same). Furthermore, despite their inability to vote, hold office, or receive certain awards, women affiliated with the Jaycees attend various meetings, participate in selected projects, and engage in many of the organization's social functions. See Tr. 58. Indeed, numerous nonmembers of both genders regularly participate in a substantial portion of activities central to the decision of many members to associate with one another, including many of the organization's various community programs, awards ceremonies, and recruitment meetings. See, e. g., 305 N.W. 2d, at 772; Report, App. to Juris. Statement A102, A103.
In short, the local chapters of the Jaycees are neither small nor selective. Moreover, much of the activity central to the formation and maintenance of the association involves the participation of strangers to that relationship. Accordingly, we conclude that the Jaycees chapters lack the distinctive characteristics that might afford constitutional protection to the decision of its members to exclude women. We turn *622 therefore to consider the extent to which application of the Minnesota statute to compel the Jaycees to accept women infringes the group's freedom of expressive association.

B
An individual's freedom to speak, to worship, and to petition the government for the redress of grievances could not be vigorously protected from interference by the State unless a correlative freedom to engage in group effort toward those ends were not also guaranteed. See, e. g., Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290, 294 (1981). According protection to collective effort on behalf of shared goals is especially important in preserving political and cultural diversity and in shielding dissident expression from suppression by the majority. See, e. g., Gilmore v. City of Montgomery, 417 U. S., at 575; Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S., at 482-485; NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 431 (1963); NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S., at 462. Consequently, we have long understood as implicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment a corresponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational, religious, and cultural ends. See, e. g., NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 907-909, 932-933 (1982); Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 244-246 (1982); In re Primus, 436 U.S. 412, 426 (1978); Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, 431 U.S. 209, 231 (1977). In view of the various protected activities in which the Jaycees engages, see infra, at 626-627, that right is plainly implicated in this case.
Government actions that may unconstitutionally infringe upon this freedom can take a number of forms. Among other things, government may seek to impose penalties or withhold benefits from individuals because of their membership in a disfavored group, e. g., Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180-184 (1972); it may attempt to require disclosure of *623 the fact of membership in a group seeking anonymity, e. g., Brown v. Socialist Workers '74 Campaign Committee, 459 U.S. 87, 91-92 (1982); and it may try to interfere with the internal organization or affairs of the group, e. g., Cousins v. Wigoda, 419 U.S. 477, 487-488 (1975). By requiring the Jaycees to admit women as full voting members, the Minnesota Act works an infringement of the last type. There can be no clearer example of an intrusion into the internal structure or affairs of an association than a regulation that forces the group to accept members it does not desire. Such a regulation may impair the ability of the original members to express only those views that brought them together. Freedom of association therefore plainly presupposes a freedom not to associate. See Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, supra, at 234-235.
The right to associate for expressive purposes is not, however, absolute. Infringements on that right may be justified by regulations adopted to serve compelling state interests, unrelated to the suppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms. E. g., Brown v. Socialist Workers '74 Campaign Committee, supra, at 91-92; Democratic Party of United States v. Wisconsin, 450 U.S. 107, 124 (1981); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 25 (1976) (per curiam); Cousins v. Wigoda, supra, at 489; American Party of Texas v. White, 415 U.S. 767, 780-781 (1974); NAACP v. Button, supra, at 438; Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 486, 488 (1960). We are persuaded that Minnesota's compelling interest in eradicating discrimination against its female citizens justifies the impact that application of the statute to the Jaycees may have on the male members' associational freedoms.
On its face, the Minnesota Act does not aim at the suppression of speech, does not distinguish between prohibited and permitted activity on the basis of viewpoint, and does not license enforcement authorities to administer the statute on the basis of such constitutionally impressible criteria. See *624 also infra, at 629-631. Nor does the Jaycees contend that the Act has been applied in this case for the purpose of hampering the organization's ability to express its views. Instead, as the Minnesota Supreme Court explained, the Act reflects the State's strong historical commitment to eliminating discrimination and assuring its citizens equal access to publicly available goods and services. See 305 N.W.2d, at 766-768. That goal, which is unrelated to the suppression of expression, plainly serves compelling state interests of the highest order.
The Minnesota Human Rights Act at issue here is an example of public accommodations laws that were adopted by some States beginning a decade before enactment of their federal counterpart, the Civil Rights Act of 1875, ch. 114, 18 Stat. 335. See Discrimination in Access to Public Places: A Survey of State and Federal Accommodations Laws, 7 N. Y. U. Rev. L. & Soc. Change 215, 238 (1978) (hereinafter NYU Survey). Indeed, when this Court invalidated that federal statute in the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3 (1883), it emphasized the fact that state laws imposed a variety of equal access obligations on public accommodations. Id., at 19, 25. In response to that decision, many more States, including Minnesota, adopted statutes prohibiting racial discrimination in public accommodations. These laws provided the primary means for protecting the civil rights of historically disadvantaged groups until the Federal Government reentered the field in 1957. See NYU Survey 239; Brief for State of New York et al. as Amici Curiae 1. Like many other States, Minnesota has progressively broadened the scope of its public accommodations law in the years since it was first enacted, both with respect to the number and type of covered facilities and with respect to the groups against whom discrimination is forbidden. See 305 N.W.2d, at 766-768. In 1973, the Minnesota Legislature added discrimination on the basis of sex to the types of conduct prohibited by the statute. Act of May 24, 1973, ch. 729, § 3, 1973 Minn. Laws 2164.
*625 By prohibiting gender discrimination in places of public accommodation, the Minnesota Act protects the State's citizenry from a number of serious social and personal harms. In the context of reviewing state actions under the Equal Protection Clause, this Court has frequently noted that discrimination based on archaic and overbroad assumptions about the relative needs and capacities of the sexes forces individuals to labor under stereotypical notions that often bear no relationship to their actual abilities. It thereby both deprives persons of their individual dignity and denies society the benefits of wide participation in political, economic, and cultural life. See, e. g., Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S. 728, 744-745 (1984); Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 723-726 (1982); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 684-687 (1973) (plurality opinion). These concerns are strongly implicated with respect to gender discrimination in the allocation of publicly available goods and services. Thus, in upholding Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 243, 42 U.S. C. § 2000a, which forbids race discrimination in public accommodations, we emphasized that its ""fundamental object . . . was to vindicate `the deprivation of personal dignity that surely accompanies denials of equal access to public establishments.' "" Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 250 (1964). That stigmatizing injury, and the denial of equal opportunities that accompanies it, is surely felt as strongly by persons suffering discrimination on the basis of their sex as by those treated differently because of their race.
Nor is the state interest in assuring equal access limited to the provision of purely tangible goods and services. See Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 609 (1982). A State enjoys broad authority to create rights of public access on behalf of its citizens. PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 81-88 (1980). Like many States and municipalities, Minnesota has adopted a functional definition of public accommodations that reaches various forms of public, quasi-commercial conduct. *626 See 305 N.W.2d, at 768; Brief for National League of Cities et al. as Amici Curiae 15-16. This expansive definition reflects a recognition of the changing nature of the American economy and of the importance, both to the individual and to society, of removing the barriers to economic advancement and political and social integration that have historically plagued certain disadvantaged groups, including women. See Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313, 317 (1977) (per curiam); Frontiero v. Richardson, supra, at 684-686. Thus, in explaining its conclusion that the Jaycees local chapters are ""place[s] of public accommodations"" within the meaning of the Act, the Minnesota court noted the various commercial programs and benefits offered to members and stated that ""[l]eadership skills are `goods,' [and] business contacts and employment promotions are `privileges' and `advantages' . . . ."" 305 N.W.2d, at 772. Assuring women equal access to such goods, privileges, and advantages clearly furthers compelling state interests.
In applying the Act to the Jaycees, the State has advanced those interests through the least restrictive means of achieving its ends. Indeed, the Jaycees has failed to demonstrate that the Act imposes any serious burdens on the male members' freedom of expressive association. See Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 78 (1984) (law firm ""has not shown how its ability to fulfill [protected] function[s] would be inhibited by a requirement that it consider [a woman lawyer] for partnership on her merits""); id., at 81 (POWELL, J., concurring); see also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 71-74; American Party of Texas v. White, 415 U. S., at 790. To be sure, as the Court of Appeals noted, a ""not insubstantial part"" of the Jaycees' activities constitutes protected expression on political, economic, cultural, and social affairs. 709 F.2d, at 1570. Over the years, the national and local levels of the organization have taken public positions on a number of diverse issues, see id., at 1569-1570; Brief for Appellee 4-5, and members of the Jaycees regularly engage in a variety of *627 civic, charitable, lobbying, fundraising, and other activities worthy of constitutional protection under the First Amendment, ibid., see, e. g., Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U.S. 620, 632 (1980). There is, however, no basis in the record for concluding that admission of women as full voting members will impede the organization's ability to engage in these protected activities or to disseminate its preferred views. The Act requires no change in the Jaycees' creed of promoting the interests of young men, and it imposes no restrictions on the organization's ability to exclude individuals with ideologies or philosophies different from those of its existing members. Cf. Democratic Party of United States v. Wisconsin, 450 U. S., at 122 (recognizing the right of political parties to ""protect themselves `from intrusion by those with adverse political principles' ""). Moreover, the Jaycees already invites women to share the group's views and philosophy and to participate in much of its training and community activities. Accordingly, any claim that admission of women as full voting members will impair a symbolic message conveyed by the very fact that women are not permitted to vote is attenuated at best. Cf. Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405 (1974); Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S., at 483.
While acknowledging that ""the specific content of most of the resolutions adopted over the years by the Jaycees has nothing to do with sex,"" 709 F.2d, at 1571, the Court of Appeals nonetheless entertained the hypothesis that women members might have a different view or agenda with respect to these matters so that, if they are allowed to vote, ""some change in the Jaycees' philosophical cast can reasonably be expected,"" ibid. It is similarly arguable that, insofar as the Jaycees is organized to promote the views of young men whatever those views happen to be, admission of women as voting members will change the message communicated by the group's speech because of the gender-based assumptions of the audience. Neither supposition, however, is supported by the record. In claiming that women might have a different *628 attitude about such issues as the federal budget, school prayer, voting rights, and foreign relations, see id., at 1570, or that the organization's public positions would have a different effect if the group were not ""a purely young men's association,"" the Jaycees relies solely on unsupported generalizations about the relative interests and perspectives of men and women. See Brief for Appellee 20-22, and n. 3. Although such generalizations may or may not have a statistical basis in fact with respect to particular positions adopted by the Jaycees, we have repeatedly condemned legal decisionmaking that relies uncritically on such assumptions. See, e. g., Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 433-434 (1984); Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U. S., at 745. In the absence of a showing far more substantial than that attempted by the Jaycees, we decline to indulge in the sexual stereotyping that underlies appellee's contention that, by allowing women to vote, application of the Minnesota Act will change the content or impact of the organization's speech. Compare Wengler v. Druggists Mutual Insurance Co., 446 U.S. 142, 151-152 (1980), with Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U.S. 498, 508 (1975).
In any event, even if enforcement of the Act causes some incidental abridgment of the Jaycees' protected speech, that effect is no greater than is necessary to accomplish the State's legitimate purposes. As we have explained, acts of invidious discrimination in the distribution of publicly available goods, services, and other advantages cause unique evils that government has a compelling interest to prevent  wholly apart from the point of view such conduct may transmit. Accordingly, like violence or other types of potentially expressive activities that produce special harms distinct from their communicative impact, such practices are entitled to no constitutional protection. Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S., at 175-176. Compare NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U. S., at 907-909 (peaceful picketing), with id., at 916 (violence). In prohibiting such practices, the Minnesota Act *629 therefore ""responds precisely to the substantive problem which legitimately concerns"" the State and abridges no more speech or associational freedom than is necessary to accomplish that purpose. See City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 810 (1984).

III
We turn finally to appellee's contentions that the Minnesota Act, as interpreted by the State's highest court, is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The void-forvagueness doctrine reflects the principle that ""a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that [persons] of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law."" Connally v. General Construction Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926). The requirement that government articulate its aims with a reasonable degree of clarity ensures that state power will be exercised only on behalf of policies reflecting an authoritative choice among competing social values, reduces the danger of caprice and discrimination in the administration of the laws, enables individuals to conform their conduct to the requirements of law, and permits meaningful judicial review. See, e. g., Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357-358 (1983); Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-109 (1972); Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U.S. 399, 402-404 (1966).
We have little trouble concluding that these concerns are not seriously implicated by the Minnesota Act, either on its face or as construed in this case. In deciding that the Act reaches the Jaycees, the Minnesota Supreme Court used a number of specific and objective criteria  regarding the organization's size, selectivity, commercial nature, and use of public facilities  typically employed in determining the applicability of state and federal antidiscrimination statutes to the membership policies of assertedly private clubs. See, e. g., Nesmith v. Young Men's Christian Assn., 397 F.2d 96 *630 (CA4 1968); National Organization for Women v. Little League Baseball, Inc., 127 N. J. Super. 522, 318 A.2d 33, aff'd mem., 67 N. J. 320, 338 A.2d 198 (1974). See generally NYU Survey 223-224, 250-252. The Court of Appeals seemingly acknowledged that the Minnesota court's construction of the Act by use of these familiar standards ensures that the reach of the statute is readily ascertainable. It nevertheless concluded that the Minnesota court introduced a constitutionally fatal element of uncertainty into the statute by suggesting that the Kiwanis Club might be sufficiently ""private"" to be outside the scope of the Act. See 709 F.2d, at 1577. Like the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals, however, we read the illustrative reference to the Kiwanis Club, which the record indicates has a formal procedure for choosing members on the basis of specific and selective criteria, as simply providing a further refinement of the standards used to determine whether an organization is ""public"" or ""private."" See id., at 1582 (Lay, C. J., dissenting). By offering this counter-example, the Minnesota Supreme Court's opinion provided the statute with more, rather than less, definite content.
The contrast between the Jaycees and the Kiwanis Club drawn by the Minnesota court also disposes of appellee's contention that the Act is unconstitutionally overbroad. The Jaycees argues that the statute is ""susceptible of sweeping and improper application,"" NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S., at 433, because it could be used to restrict the membership decisions of wholly private groups organized for a wide variety of political, religious, cultural, or social purposes. Without considering the extent to which such groups may be entitled to constitutional protection from the operation of the Minnesota Act, we need only note that the Minnesota Supreme Court expressly rejected the contention that the Jaycees should ""be viewed analogously to private organizations such as the Kiwanis International Organization."" 305 N.W. 2d. at 771. The state court's articulated willingness to adopt *631 limiting constructions that would exclude private groups from the statute's reach, together with the commonly used and sufficiently precise standards it employed to determine that the Jaycees is not such a group, establish that the Act, as currently construed, does not create an unacceptable risk of application to a substantial amount of protected conduct. Cf. Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 216-217 (1975); NAACP v. Button, supra, at 434. See New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 769, n. 24 (1982).

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Reversed.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST concurs in the judgment.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE BLACKMUN took no part in the decision of this case.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment."
19859,Justice O'Connor,concurring,False,Roberts v. United States Jaycees,,1984,1.0,"I join Parts I and III of the Court's opinion, which set out the facts and reject the vagueness and overbreadth challenges to the Minnesota statute. With respect to Part II-A of the Court's opinion, I agree with the Court that the Jaycees cannot claim a right of association deriving from this Court's cases concerning ""marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education."" Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 713 (1976). Those cases, ""while defying categorical description,"" ibid., identify certain zones of privacy in which certain personal relationships or decisions are protected from government interference. Whatever the precise scope of the rights recognized in such cases, they do not encompass associational rights of a 295,000-member organization whose activities are not ""private"" in any meaningful sense of that term.
*632 I part company with the Court over its First Amendment analysis in Part II-B of its opinion. I agree with the Court that application of the Minnesota law to the Jaycees does not contravene the First Amendment, but I reach that conclusion for reasons distinct from those offered by the Court. I believe the Court has adopted a test that unadvisedly casts doubt on the power of States to pursue the profoundly important goal of ensuring nondiscriminatory access to commercial opportunities in our society. At the same time, the Court has adopted an approach to the general problem presented by this case that accords insufficient protection to expressive associations and places inappropriate burdens on groups claiming the protection of the First Amendment.

I
The Court analyzes Minnesota's attempt to regulate the Jaycees' membership using a test that I find both overprotective of activities undeserving of constitutional shelter and underprotective of important First Amendment concerns. The Court declares that the Jaycees' right of association depends on the organization's making a ""substantial"" showing that the admission of unwelcome members ""will change the message communicated by the group's speech."" See ante, at 626-628. I am not sure what showing the Court thinks would satisfy its requirement of proof of a membership-message connection, but whatever it means, the focus on such a connection is objectionable.
Imposing such a requirement, especially in the context of the balancing-of-interests test articulated by the Court, raises the possibility that certain commercial associations, by engaging occasionally in certain kinds of expressive activities, might improperly gain protection for discrimination. The Court's focus raises other problems as well. How are we to analyze the First Amendment associational claims of an organization that invokes its right, settled by the Court in *633 NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 460-466 (1958), to protect the privacy of its membership? And would the Court's analysis of this case be different if, for example, the Jaycees membership had a steady history of opposing public issues thought (by the Court) to be favored by women? It might seem easy to conclude, in the latter case, that the admission of women to the Jaycees' ranks would affect the content of the organization's message, but I do not believe that should change the outcome of this case. Whether an association is or is not constitutionally protected in the selection of its membership should not depend on what the association says or why its members say it.
The Court's readiness to inquire into the connection between membership and message reveals a more fundamental flaw in its analysis. The Court pursues this inquiry as part of its mechanical application of a ""compelling interest"" test, under which the Court weighs the interests of the State of Minnesota in ending gender discrimination against the Jaycees' First Amendment right of association. The Court entirely neglects to establish at the threshold that the Jaycees is an association whose activities or purposes should engage the strong protections that the First Amendment extends to expressive associations.
On the one hand, an association engaged exclusively in protected expression enjoys First Amendment protection of both the content of its message and the choice of its members. Protection of the message itself is judged by the same standards as protection of speech by an individual. Protection of the association's right to define its membership derives from the recognition that the formation of an expressive association is the creation of a voice, and the selection of members is the definition of that voice. ""In the realm of protected speech, the legislature is constitutionally disqualified from dictating . . . the speakers who may address a public issue."" First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 784-785 (1978); Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 *634 U. S. 92, 96 (1972). A ban on specific group voices on public affairs violates the most basic guarantee of the First Amendment  that citizens, not the government, control the content of public discussion.
On the other hand, there is only minimal constitutional protection of the freedom of commercial association. There are, of course, some constitutional protections of commercial speech  speech intended and used to promote a commercial transaction with the speaker. But the State is free to impose any rational regulation on the commercial transaction itself. The Constitution does not guarantee a right to choose employees, customers, suppliers, or those with whom one engages in simple commercial transactions, without restraint from the State. A shopkeeper has no constitutional right to deal only with persons of one sex.
The dichotomy between rights of commercial association and rights of expressive association is also found in the more limited constitutional protections accorded an association's recruitment and solicitation activities and other dealings with its members and the public. Reasonable, content-neutral state regulation of the time, place, and manner of an organization's relations with its members or with the State can pass constitutional muster, but only if the regulation is ""narrowly drawn"" to serve a ""sufficiently strong, subordinating interest"" ""without unnecessarily interfering with First Amendment freedoms."" Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U.S. 620, 636-637 (1980); see Secretary of State of Maryland v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U.S. 947, 960-961 (1984). Thus, after careful scrutiny, we have upheld regulations on matters such as the financial dealings between an association and its members, see Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 25 (1976), disclosure of membership lists to the State, see NAACP v. Alabama, supra, at 463; Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 486 (1960), access to the ballot, time limits on registering before elections, and similar matters, see, e. g., Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U.S. 752 (1973); Dunn *635 v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330 (1972); Bullock v. Carter, 405 U.S. 134 (1972); Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U.S. 431 (1971); Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23 (1968). See also Heffron v. International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U.S. 640, 649 (1981). By contrast, an organization engaged in commercial activity enjoys only minimal constitutional protection of its recruitment, training, and solicitation activities. While the Court has acknowledged a First Amendment right to engage in nondeceptive commercial advertising, governmental regulation of the commercial recruitment of new members, stockholders, customers, or employees is valid if rationally related to the government's ends.
Many associations cannot readily be described as purely expressive or purely commercial. No association is likely ever to be exclusively engaged in expressive activities, if only because it will collect dues from its members or purchase printing materials or rent lecture halls or serve coffee and cakes at its meetings. And innumerable commercial associations also engage in some incidental protected speech or advocacy. The standard for deciding just how much of an association's involvement in commercial activity is enough to suspend the association's First Amendment right to control its membership cannot, therefore, be articulated with simple precision. Clearly the standard must accept the reality that even the most expressive of associations is likely to touch, in some way or other, matters of commerce. The standard must nevertheless give substance to the ideal of complete protection for purely expressive association, even while it readily permits state regulation of commercial affairs.
In my view, an association should be characterized as commercial, and therefore subject to rationally related state regulation of its membership and other associational activities, when, and only when, the association's activities are not predominantly of the type protected by the First Amendment. It is only when the association is predominantly engaged in protected expression that state regulation of its *636 membership will necessarily affect, change, dilute, or silence one collective voice that would otherwise be heard. An association must choose its market. Once it enters the marketplace of commerce in any substantial degree it loses the complete control over its membership that it would otherwise enjoy if it confined its affairs to the marketplace of ideas.
Determining whether an association's activity is predominantly protected expression will often be difficult, if only because a broad range of activities can be expressive. It is easy enough to identify expressive words or conduct that are strident, contentious, or divisive, but protected expression may also take the form of quiet persuasion, inculcation of traditional values, instruction of the young, and community service. Cf. Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923). The purposes of an association, and the purposes of its members in adhering to it, are doubtless relevant in determining whether the association is primarily engaged in protected expression. Lawyering to advance social goals may be speech, NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 429-430 (1963), but ordinary commercial law practice is not, see Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69 (1984). A group boycott or refusal to deal for political purposes may be speech, NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 912-915 (1982), though a similar boycott for purposes of maintaining a cartel is not. Even the training of outdoor survival skills or participation in community service might become expressive when the activity is intended to develop good morals, reverence, patriotism, and a desire for self-improvement.[*]
*637 The considerations that may enter into the determination of when a particular association of persons is predominantly engaged in expression are therefore fluid and somewhat uncertain. But the Court has recognized the need to draw similar lines in the past. Two examples, both addressed in cases decided this Term, stand out.
The first concerns claims of First Amendment protection made by lawyers. On the one hand, some lawyering activity is undoubtedly protected by the First Amendment. ""[C]ollective activity undertaken to obtain meaningful access to the courts is a fundamental right within the protection of the First Amendment."" In re Primus, 436 U.S. 412, 426 (1978); see NAACP v. Button, supra, at 429-430. On the other hand, ordinary law practice for commercial ends has never been given special First Amendment protection. ""A lawyer's procurement of remunerative employment is a subject only marginally affected with First Amendment concerns."" Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U.S. 447, 459 (1978). We emphasized this point only this Term in Hishon v. King & Spalding, supra, where we readily rejected a large commercial law firm's claim to First Amendment protection for alleged gender-based discriminatory partnership decisions for associates of the firm. We found no need to inquire into any connection between gender as a condition of partnership and the speech of the law firm, and we undertook no weighing of ""compelling"" state interests against the speech interests of the law firm. As a commercial enterprise, the law firm could claim no First Amendment immunity from employment discrimination laws, and that result would not have been altered by a showing that the firm engaged even in a substantial amount of activity entitled to First Amendment protection.
We have adopted a similar analysis in our cases concerning association with a labor union. A State is free to impose rational regulation of the membership of a labor union representing ""the general business needs of employees."" Railway *638 Mail Assn. v. Corsi, 326 U.S. 88, 94 (1945) (emphasis added). The State may not, on the other hand, compel association with a union engaged in ideological activities. Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, 431 U.S. 209, 236 (1977). The Court has thus ruled that a State may compel association for the commercial purposes of engaging in collective bargaining, administering labor contracts, and adjusting employment-related grievances, but it may not infringe on associational rights involving ideological or political associations. Ibid. We applied this distinction in Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U.S. 435 (1984), decided this Term. Again, the constitutional inquiry is not qualified by any analysis of governmental interests and does not turn on an individual's ability to establish disagreement with the particular views promulgated by the union. It is enough if the individual simply expresses unwillingness to be associated with the union's ideological activities.
In summary, this Court's case law recognizes radically different constitutional protections for expressive and nonexpressive associations. The First Amendment is offended by direct state control of the membership of a private organization engaged exclusively in protected expressive activity, but no First Amendment interest stands in the way of a State's rational regulation of economic transactions by or within a commercial association. The proper approach to analysis of First Amendment claims of associational freedom is, therefore, to distinguish nonexpressive from expressive associations and to recognize that the former lack the full constitutional protections possessed by the latter.

II
Minnesota's attempt to regulate the membership of the Jaycees chapters operating in that State presents a relatively easy case for application of the expressive-commercial dichotomy. Both the Minnesota Supreme Court and the United States District Court, which expressly adopted the state *639 court's findings, made findings of fact concerning the commercial nature of the Jaycees' activities. The Court of Appeals, which disagreed with the District Court over the legal conclusions to be drawn from the facts, did not dispute any of those findings. United States Jaycees v. McClure, 709 F.2d 1560 (CA8 1983). ""The Jaycees is not a political party, or even primarily a political pressure group, but the advocacy of political and public causes, selected by the membership, is a not insubstantial part of what it does. . . . [A] good deal of what the [Jaycees] does indisputably comes within the right of association . . . in pursuance of the specific ends of speech, writing, belief, and assembly for redress of grievances."" Id., at 1570.
There is no reason to question the accuracy of this characterization. Notwithstanding its protected expressive activities, the Jaycees  otherwise known as the Junior Chamber of Commerce  is, first and foremost, an organization that, at both the national and local levels, promotes and practices the art of solicitation and management. The organization claims that the training it offers its members gives them an advantage in business, and business firms do indeed sometimes pay the dues of individual memberships for their employees. Jaycees members hone their solicitation and management skills, under the direction and supervision of the organization, primarily through their active recruitment of new members. ""One of the major activities of the Jaycees is the sale of memberships in the organization. It encourages continuous recruitment of members with the expressed goal of increasing membership . . . . The Jaycees itself refers to its members as customers and membership as a product it is selling. More than 80 percent of the national officers' time is dedicated to recruitment, and more than half of the available achievement awards are in part conditioned on achievement in recruitment."" United States Jaycees v. McClure, 534 F. Supp. 766, 769 (Minn. 1982). The organization encourages record-breaking performance in selling memberships: the *640 current records are 348 for most memberships sold in a year by one person, 134 for most sold in a month, and 1,586 for most sold in a lifetime.
Recruitment and selling are commercial activities, even when conducted for training rather than for profit. The ""not insubstantial"" volume of protected Jaycees activity found by the Court of Appeals is simply not enough to preclude state regulation of the Jaycees' commercial activities. The State of Minnesota has a legitimate interest in ensuring nondiscriminatory access to the commercial opportunity presented by membership in the Jaycees. The members of the Jaycees may not claim constitutional immunity from Minnesota's antidiscrimination law by seeking to exercise their First Amendment rights through this commercial organization.
For these reasons, I agree with the Court that the Jaycees' First Amendment challenge to the application of Minnesota's public accommodations law is meritless. I therefore concur in Parts I and III of the Court's opinion and in the judgment.

23164,Justice Burger,majority,False,Hishon v. King & Spalding,,1984,2.0,"We granted certiorari to determine whether the District Court properly dismissed a Title VII complaint alleging that a law partnership discriminated against petitioner, a woman lawyer employed as an associate, when it failed to invite her to become a partner.

I

A
In 1972 petitioner Elizabeth Anderson Hishon accepted a position as an associate with respondent, a large Atlanta law firm established as a general partnership. When this suit was filed in 1980, the firm had more than 50 partners and employed approximately 50 attorneys as associates. Up to that time, no woman had ever served as a partner at the firm.
Petitioner alleges that the prospect of partnership was an important factor in her initial decision to accept employment with respondent. She alleges that respondent used the possibility of ultimate partnership as a recruiting device to induce petitioner and other young lawyers to become associates at the firm. According to the complaint, respondent represented that advancement to partnership after five or six *72 years was ""a matter of course"" for associates ""who receive[d] satisfactory evaluations"" and that associates were promoted to partnership ""on a fair and equal basis."" Petitioner alleges that she relied on these representations when she accepted employment with respondent. The complaint further alleges that respondent's promise to consider her on a ""fair and equal basis"" created a binding employment contract.
In May 1978 the partnership considered and rejected Hishon for admission to the partnership; one year later, the partners again declined to invite her to become a partner.[1] Once an associate is passed over for partnership at respondent's firm, the associate is notified to begin seeking employment elsewhere. Petitioner's employment as an associate terminated on December 31, 1979.

B
Hishon filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on November 19, 1979, claiming that respondent had discriminated against her on the basis of her sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 241, as amended, 42 U.S. C. § 2000e et seq. Ten days later the Commission issued a notice of right to sue, and on February 27, 1980, Hishon brought this action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. She sought declaratory and injunctive relief, backpay, and compensatory damages ""in lieu of reinstatement and promotion to partnership."" This, of course, negates any claim for specific performance of the contract alleged.
The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that Title VII was inapplicable to the selection of partners *73 by a partnership.[2] 24 FEP Cases 1303 (1980). A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. 678 F.2d 1022 (1982). We granted certiorari, 459 U.S. 1169 (1983), and we reverse.

II
At this stage of the litigation, we must accept petitioner's allegations as true. A court may dismiss a complaint only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations. Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957). The issue before us is whether petitioner's allegations state a claim under Title VII, the relevant portion of which provides as follows:
""(a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer 
""(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."" 42 U.S. C. § 2000e-2(a) (emphasis added).

A
Petitioner alleges that respondent is an ""employer"" to whom Title VII is addressed.[3] She then asserts that consideration *74 for partnership was one of the ""terms, conditions, or privileges of employment"" as an associate with respondent.[4] See § 2000e-2(a)(1). If this is correct, respondent could not base an adverse partnership decision on ""race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.""
Once a contractual relationship of employment is established, the provisions of Title VII attach and govern certain aspects of that relationship.[5] In the context of Title VII, the contract of employment may be written or oral, formal or informal; an informal contract of employment may arise by the simple act of handing a job applicant a shovel and providing a workplace. The contractual relationship of employment triggers the provision of Title VII governing ""terms, conditions, or privileges of employment."" Title VII in turn forbids discrimination on the basis of ""race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.""
Because the underlying employment relationship is contractual, it follows that the ""terms, conditions, or privileges of employment"" clearly include benefits that are part of an employment contract. Here, petitioner in essence alleges that respondent made a contract to consider her for partnership.[6] Indeed, this promise was allegedly a key contractual *75 provision which induced her to accept employment. If the evidence at trial establishes that the parties contracted to have petitioner considered for partnership, that promise clearly was a term, condition, or privilege of her employment. Title VII would then bind respondent to consider petitioner for partnership as the statute provides, i. e., without regard to petitioner's sex. The contract she alleges would lead to the same result.
Petitioner's claim that a contract was made, however, is not the only allegation that would qualify respondent's consideration of petitioner for partnership as a term, condition, or privilege of employment. An employer may provide its employees with many benefits that it is under no obligation to furnish by any express or implied contract. Such a benefit, though not a contractual right of employment, may qualify as a ""privileg[e]"" of employment under Title VII. A benefit that is part and parcel of the employment relationship may not be doled out in a discriminatory fashion, even if the employer would be free under the employment contract simply not to provide the benefit at all. Those benefits that comprise the ""incidents of employment,"" S. Rep. No. 867, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 11 (1964),[7] or that form ""an aspect of the relationship between the employer and employees,"" Chemical & Alkali Workers v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., *76 404 U.S. 157, 178 (1971),[8] may not be afforded in a manner contrary to Title VII.
Several allegations in petitioner's complaint would support the conclusion that the opportunity to become a partner was part and parcel of an associate's status as an employee at respondent's firm, independent of any allegation that such an opportunity was included in associates' employment contracts. Petitioner alleges that respondent's associates could regularly expect to be considered for partnership at the end of their ""apprenticeships,"" and it appears that lawyers outside the firm were not routinely so considered.[9] Thus, the benefit of partnership consideration was allegedly linked directly with an associate's status as an employee, and this linkage was far more than coincidental: petitioner alleges that respondent explicitly used the prospect of ultimate partnership to induce young lawyers to join the firm. Indeed, the importance of the partnership decision to a lawyer's status as an associate is underscored by the allegation that associates' employment is terminated if they are not elected to become partners. These allegations, if proved at trial, would suffice to show that partnership consideration was a term, condition, or privilege of an associate's employment at respondent's firm, and accordingly that partnership consideration must be without regard to sex.


*77 B
Respondent contends that advancement to partnership may never qualify as a term, condition, or privilege of employment for purposes of Title VII. First, respondent asserts that elevation to partnership entails a change in status from an ""employee"" to an ""employer."" However, even if respondent is correct that a partnership invitation is not itself an offer of employment, Title VII would nonetheless apply and preclude discrimination on the basis of sex. The benefit a plaintiff is denied need not be employment to fall within Title VII's protection; it need only be a term, condition, or privilege of employment. It is also of no consequence that employment as an associate necessarily ends when an associate becomes a partner. A benefit need not accrue before a person's employment is completed to be a term, condition, or privilege of that employment relationship. Pension benefits, for example, qualify as terms, conditions, or privileges of employment even though they are received only after employment terminates. Arizona Governing Committee for Tax Deferred Annuity & Deferred Compensation Plans v. Norris, 463 U.S. 1073, 1079 (1983) (opinion of MARSHALL, J.). Accordingly, nothing in the change in status that advancement to partnership might entail means that partnership consideration falls outside the terms of the statute. See Lucido v. Cravath, Swaine & Moore, 425 F. Supp. 123, 128-129 (SDNY 1977).
Second, respondent argues that Title VII categorically exempts partnership decisions from scrutiny. However, respondent points to nothing in the statute or the legislative history that would support such a per se exemption.[10] When *78 Congress wanted to grant an employer complete immunity, it expressly did so.[11]
Third, respondent argues that application of Title VII in this case would infringe constitutional rights of expression or association. Although we have recognized that the activities of lawyers may make a ""distinctive contribution . . . to the ideas and beliefs of our society,"" NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 431 (1963), respondent has not shown how its ability to fulfill such a function would be inhibited by a requirement that it consider petitioner for partnership on her merits. Moreover, as we have held in another context, ""[i]nvidious private discrimination may be characterized as a form of exercising freedom of association protected by the First Amendment, but it has never been accorded affirmative constitutional protections."" Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U.S. 455, 470 (1973). There is no constitutional right, for example, to discriminate in the selection of who may attend a private school or join a labor union. Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160 (1976); Railway Mail Assn. v. Corsi, 326 U.S. 88, 93-94 (1945).

III
We conclude that petitioner's complaint states a claim cognizable under Title VII. Petitioner therefore is entitled to *79 her day in court to prove her allegations. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered."
23165,Justice Powell,concurring,False,Hishon v. King & Spalding,,1984,2.0,"I join the Court's opinion holding that petitioner's complaint alleges a violation of Title VII and that the motion to dismiss should not have been granted. Petitioner's complaint avers that the law firm violated its promise that she would be considered for partnership on a ""fair and equal basis"" within the time span that associates generally are so considered.[1] Petitioner is entitled to the opportunity to prove these averments.
I write to make clear my understanding that the Court's opinion should not be read as extending Title VII to the management of a law firm by its partners. The reasoning of the Court's opinion does not require that the relationship among partners be characterized as an ""employment"" relationship to which Title VII would apply. The relationship among law partners differs markedly from that between employer and employee  including that between the partnership and its associates.[2] The judgmental and sensitive decisions that must be made among the partners embrace a wide range of subjects.[3] The essence of the law partnership is the common *80 conduct of a shared enterprise. The relationship among law partners contemplates that decisions important to the partnership normally will be made by common agreement, see, e. g., Memorandum of Agreement, King & Spalding, App. 153-164 (respondent's partnership agreement), or consent among the partners.
Respondent contends that for these reasons application of Title VII to the decision whether to admit petitioner to the firm implicates the constitutional right to association. But here it is alleged that respondent as an employer is obligated by contract to consider petitioner for partnership on equal terms without regard to sex. I agree that enforcement of this obligation, voluntarily assumed, would impair no right of association.[4]
*81 In admission decisions made by law firms, it is now widely recognized  as it should be  that in fact neither race nor sex is relevant. The qualities of mind, capacity to reason logically, ability to work under pressure, leadership, and the like are unrelated to race or sex. This is demonstrated by the success of women and minorities in law schools, in the practice of law, on the bench, and in positions of community, state, and national leadership. Law firms  and, of course, society  are the better for these changes.
"
26560,Justice Burger,dissenting,False,Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,,1986,2.0,"I agree with much of JUSTICE WHITE's and JUSTICE O'CONNOR's dissents. In my concurrence in the companion case to Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, in 1973, I noted:
""I do not read the Court's holdings today as having the sweeping consequences attributed to them by the dissenting Justices; the dissenting views discount the reality that the vast majority of physicians observe the standards of their profession, and act only on the basis of carefully deliberated medical judgments relating to life and health. Plainly, the Court today rejects any claim that the Constitution requires abortions on demand."" Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 208 (1973).
Later, in Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 481 (1977), I stated my view that
""[t]he Court's holdings in Roe . . . and Doe v. Bolton . . . simply require that a State not create an absolute barrier to a woman's decision to have an abortion.""
I based my concurring statements in Roe and Maher on the principle expressed in the Court's opinion in Roe that the right to an abortion ""is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation."" 410 U.S., at 154-155. In short, every Member of the Roe Court rejected the idea of abortion on demand. The Court's opinion today, however, plainly undermines that important *783 principle, and I regretfully conclude that some of the concerns of the dissenting Justices in Roe, as well as the concerns I expressed in my separate opinion, have now been realized.
The extent to which the Court has departed from the limitations expressed in Roe is readily apparent. In Roe, the Court emphasized
""that the State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman . . . ."" Id., at 162.
Yet today the Court astonishingly goes so far as to say that the State may not even require that a woman contemplating an abortion be provided with accurate medical information concerning the risks inherent in the medical procedure which she is about to undergo and the availability of state-funded alternatives if she elects not to run those risks. Can anyone doubt that the State could impose a similar requirement with respect to other medical procedures? Can anyone doubt that doctors routinely give similar information concerning risks in countless procedures having far less impact on life and health, both physical and emotional than an abortion, and risk a malpractice lawsuit if they fail to do so?
Yet the Court concludes that the State cannot impose this simple information-dispensing requirement in the abortion context where the decision is fraught with serious physical, psychological, and moral concerns of the highest order. Can it possibly be that the Court is saying that the Constitution forbids the communication of such critical information to a woman?[*] We have apparently already passed the point at *784 which abortion is available merely on demand. If the statute at issue here is to be invalidated, the ""demand"" will not even have to be the result of an informed choice.
The Court in Roe further recognized that the State ""has still another important and legitimate interest"" which is ""separate and distinct"" from the interest in protecting maternal health, i. e., an interest in ""protecting the potentiality of human life."" Ibid. The point at which these interests become ""compelling"" under Roe is at viability of the fetus. Id., at 163. Today, however, the Court abandons that standard and renders the solemnly stated concerns of the 1973 Roe opinion for the interests of the states mere shallow rhetoric. The statute at issue in this case requires that a second physician be present during an abortion performed after viability, so that the second physician can ""take control of the child and. . . provide immediate medical care . . . taking all reasonable steps necessary, in his judgment, to preserve the child's life and health."" 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 3210(c) (1982).
Essentially this provision simply states that a viable fetus is to be cared for, not destroyed. No governmental power exists to say that a viable fetus should not have every protection required to preserve its life. Undoubtedly the Pennsylvania Legislature added the second-physician requirement on the mistaken assumption that this Court meant what it said in Roe concerning the ""compelling interest"" of the states in potential life after viability.
The Court's opinion today is but the most recent indication of the distance traveled since Roe. Perhaps the first important road marker was the Court's holding in Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52 (1976), in which the Court held (over the dissent of JUSTICE WHITE *785A joined by JUSTICE REHNQUIST and myself) that the State may not require that minors seeking an abortion first obtain parental consent. Parents, not judges or social workers, have the inherent right and responsibility to advise their children in matters of this sensitivity and consequence. Can one imagine a surgeon performing an amputation or even an appendectomy on a 14-year-old girl without the consent of a parent or guardian except in an emergency situation?
Yet today the Court goes beyond Danforth by remanding for further consideration of the provisions of Pennsylvania's statute requiring that a minor seeking an abortion without parental consent petition the appropriate court for authorization. Even if I were to agree that the Constitution requires that the states may not provide that a minor receive parental consent before undergoing an abortion, I would certainly hold that judicial approval may be required. This is in keeping with the longstanding common-law principle that courts may function in loco parentis when parents are unavailable or neglectful, even though courts are not very satisfactory substitutes when the issue is whether a 12-, 14-, or 16-year-old unmarried girl should have an abortion. In my view, no remand is necessary on this point because the statutory provision in question is constitutional.
In discovering constitutional infirmities in state regulations of abortion that are in accord with our history and tradition, we may have lured judges into ""roaming at large in the constitutional field."" Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 502 (1965) (Harlan, J., concurring). The soundness of our holdings must be tested by the decisions that purport to follow them. If Danforth and today's holding really mean what they seem to say, I agree we should reexamine Roe."
26559,Justice Stevens,concurring,False,Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,,1986,2.0,"The scope of the individual interest in liberty that is given protection by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is a matter about which conscientious judges have long disagreed. Although I believe that that interest is significantly broader than JUSTICE WHITE does,[1] I have always *773 had the highest respect for his views on this subject.[2] In this case, although our ultimate conclusions differ, it may be useful to emphasize some of our areas of agreement in order to ensure that the clarity of certain fundamental propositions not be obscured by his forceful rhetoric.
Let me begin with a reference to Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), the case holding that a State may not totally forbid the use of birth control devices. Although the Court's opinion relied on a ""right of marital privacy"" within the ""penumbra"" of the Bill of Rights, id., at 481-486, JUSTICE WHITE's concurring opinion went right to the heart of the issue. He wrote:
""It would be unduly repetitious, and belaboring the obvious, to expound on the impact of this statute on the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment against arbitrary or capricious denials or on the nature of this liberty. Suffice it to say that this is not the first time this Court has had occasion to articulate that the liberty entitled to protection under the Fourteenth Amendment includes the right `to marry, establish a home and bring up children,' Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399, and `the liberty . . . to direct the upbringing and education of children,' Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 534-535, and that these are among `the basic civil rights of man.' Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541. These decisions affirm that there is a `realm of family life which the state cannot enter' without substantial justification. Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166. Surely the right invoked in this case, to be free of regulation of the intimacies of the marriage relationship, `come[s] to this Court with a momentum for respect lacking when appeal is made to liberties which derive merely from shifting economic arrangements.' *774 Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77, 95 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.)."" Id., at 502-503 (WHITE, J., concurring in the judgment).
He concluded that the statute could not be constitutionally applied to married persons, explaining:
""I find nothing in this record justifying the sweeping scope of this statute, with its telling effect on the freedoms of married persons, and therefore conclude that it deprives such persons of liberty without due process of law."" Id., at 507.
That conclusion relied in part on the fact that the statute involved ""sensitive areas of liberty""[3] and in part on the absence of any colorable justification for applying the statute to married couples.
In Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972), JUSTICE WHITE concluded that a similar Massachusetts statute was invalid as applied to a person whom the record did not identify as either married or unmarried, id., at 464-465, and in Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U.S. 678 (1977), he subscribed to this explanation of the holdings in Griswold and Eisenstadt:
""The fatal fallacy in [the appellants'] argument is that it overlooks the underlying premise of those decisions that the Constitution protects `the right of the individual *775. . . to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into . . . the decision whether to bear or beget a child.' [Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S.] at 453. Griswold did state that by `forbidding the use of contraceptives rather than regulating their manufacture or sale,' the Connecticut statute there had `a maximum destructive impact' on privacy rights. 381 U.S., at 485. This intrusion into `the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms' made that statute particularly `repulsive.' Id., at 485-486. But subsequent decisions have made clear that the constitutional protection of individual autonomy in matters of childbearing is not dependent on that element. Eisenstadt v. Baird, holding that the protection is not limited to married couples, characterized the protected right as the `decision whether to bear or beget a child.' 405 U.S., at 453 (emphasis added). Similarly, Roe v. Wade, held that the Constitution protects `a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.' 410 U.S., at 153 (emphasis added). See also Whalen v. Roe, [429 U.S. 589,] 599-600, and n. 26. These decisions put Griswold in proper perspective. Griswold may no longer be read as holding only that a State may not prohibit a married couple's use of contraceptives. Read in light of its progeny, the teaching of Griswold is that the Constitution protects individual decisions in matters of childbearing from unjustified intrusion by the State."" 431 U.S., at 687; id., at 702 (WHITE, J., concurring in pertinent part and concurring in result).
Thus, the aspect of liberty at stake in this case is the freedom from unwarranted governmental intrusion into individual decisions in matters of childbearing. As JUSTICE WHITE explained in Griswold, that aspect of liberty comes to this Court with a momentum for respect that is lacking when appeal is made to liberties which derive merely from shifting economic arrangements.
*776 Like the birth control statutes involved in Griswold and Baird, the abortion statutes involved in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and in the case before us today apply equally to decisions made by married persons and by unmarried persons. Consistently with his views in those cases, JUSTICE WHITE agrees that ""a woman's ability to choose an abortion is a species of `liberty' that is subject to the general protections of the Due Process Clause."" Post, at 790. His agreement with that ""indisputable"" proposition, ibid., is not qualified or limited to decisions made by pregnant women who are married and, indeed, it would be a strange form of liberty if it were so limited.
Up to this point in JUSTICE WHITE's analysis, his opinion is fully consistent with the accepted teachings of the Court and with the major premises of Roe v. Wade. For reasons that are not entirely clear, however, JUSTICE WHITE abruptly announces that the interest in ""liberty"" that is implicated by a decision not to bear a child that is made a few days after conception is less fundamental than a comparable decision made before conception. Post, at 791-792. There may, of course, be a significant difference in the strength of the countervailing state interest, but I fail to see how a decision on childbearing becomes less important the day after conception than the day before. Indeed, if one decision is more ""fundamental"" to the individual's freedom than the other, surely it is the postconception decision that is the more serious. Thus, it is difficult for me to understand how JUSTICE WHITE reaches the conclusion that restraints upon this aspect of a woman's liberty do not ""call into play anything more than the most minimal judicial scrutiny."" Post, at 790.[4]
*777 If JUSTICE WHITE were correct in regarding the post-conception decision of the question whether to bear a child as a relatively unimportant, second-class sort of interest, I might agree with his view that the individual should be required to conform her decision to the will of the majority. But if that decision commands the respect that is traditionally associated with the ""sensitive areas of liberty"" protected by the Constitution, as JUSTICE WHITE characterized reproductive decisions in Griswold, 381 U. S., at 503, no individual should be compelled to surrender the freedom to make that decision for herself simply because her ""value preferences"" are not shared by the majority.[5] In a sense, the basic question is whether the ""abortion decision"" should be made by the individual or by the majority ""in the unrestrained imposition *778 of its own, extraconstitutional value preferences."" Post, at 794. But surely JUSTICE WHITE is quite wrong in suggesting that the Court is imposing value preferences on anyone else. Ibid.[6]
JUSTICE WHITE is also surely wrong in suggesting that the governmental interest in protecting fetal life is equally compelling during the entire period from the moment of conception until the moment of birth. Post, at 795. Again, I recognize that a powerful theological argument can be made for that position, but I believe our jurisdiction is limited to the evaluation of secular state interests.[7] I should think it obvious that the State's interest in the protection of an embryo  even if that interest is defined as ""protecting those who will be citizens,"" ibid.  increases progressively and dramatically as the organism's capacity to feel pain, to experience pleasure, to survive, and to react to its surroundings increases day by day. The development of a fetus  and pregnancy itself  are not static conditions, and the assertion that the government's interest is static simply ignores this reality.
*779 Nor is it an answer to argue that life itself is not a static condition, and that ""there is no nonarbitrary line separating a fetus from a child, or indeed, an adult human being,"" post, at 792. For, unless the religious view that a fetus is a ""person"" is adopted  a view JUSTICE WHITE refuses to embrace, ibid.  there is a fundamental and well-recognized difference between a fetus and a human being; indeed, if there is not such a difference, the permissibility of terminating the life of a fetus could scarcely be left to the will of the state legislatures.[8] And if distinctions may be drawn between a fetus and a human being in terms of the state interest in their protection  even though the fetus represents one of ""those who will be citizens""  it seems to me quite odd to argue that distinctions may not also be drawn between the state interest in protecting the freshly fertilized egg and the state interest in protecting the 9-month-gestated, fully sentient fetus on the eve of birth. Recognition of this distinction is supported not only by logic, but also by history[9] and by our shared experiences.
Turning to JUSTICE WHITE's comments on stare decisis, he is of course correct in pointing out that the Court ""has not hesitated to overrule decisions, or even whole lines of cases, where experience, scholarship, and reflection demonstrated that their fundamental premises were not to be found in the Constitution."" Post, at 787. But JUSTICE WHITE has not disavowed the ""fundamental premises"" on which the decision in Roe v. Wade rests. He has not disavowed the Court's prior approach to the interpretation of the word ""liberty"" or, more narrowly, the line of cases that culminated in the unequivocal holding, applied to unmarried persons and married persons alike, ""that the Constitution protects individual decisions in matters of childbearing from unjustified intrusion by *780 the State."" Carey, 431 U. S., at 687; id., at 702 (WHITE, J., concurring in pertinent part).[10]
Nor does the fact that the doctrine of stare decisis is not an absolute bar to the reexamination of past interpretations of the Constitution mean that the values underlying that doctrine may be summarily put to one side. There is a strong public interest in stability, and in the orderly conduct of our *781 affairs, that is served by a consistent course of constitutional adjudication. Acceptance of the fundamental premises that underlie the decision in Roe v. Wade, as well as the application of those premises in that case, places the primary responsibility for decision in matters of childbearing squarely in the private sector of our society.[11] The majority remains free to preach the evils of birth control and abortion and to persuade others to make correct decisions while the individual faced with the reality of a difficult choice having serious and personal consequences of major importance to her own future  perhaps to the salvation of her own immortal soul  remains free to seek and to obtain sympathetic guidance from those who share her own value preferences.
In the final analysis, the holding in Roe v. Wade presumes that it is far better to permit some individuals to make incorrect decisions than to deny all individuals the right to make decisions that have a profound effect upon their destiny. Arguably a very primitive society would have been protected from evil by a rule against eating apples; a majority familiar with Adam's experience might favor such a rule. But the lawmakers who placed a special premium on the protection of *782 individual liberty have recognized that certain values are more important than the will of a transient majority.["
26561,Justice White,second_dissenting,False,Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,,1986,2.0,"Today the Court carries forward the ""difficult and continuing venture in substantive due process,"" Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52 (1976) *786 (WHITE, J., dissenting), that began with the decision in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and has led the Court further and further afield in the 13 years since that decision was handed down. I was in dissent in Roe v. Wade and am in dissent today. In Part I below, I state why I continue to believe that this venture has been fundamentally misguided since its inception. In Part II, I submit that even accepting Roe v. Wade, the concerns underlying that decision by no means command or justify the results reached today. Indeed, in my view, our precedents in this area, applied in a manner consistent with sound principles of constitutional adjudication, require reversal of the Court of Appeals on the ground that the provisions before us are facially constitutional.[1]

The rule of stare decisis is essential if case-by-case judicial decisionmaking is to be reconciled with the principle of the *787 rule of law, for when governing legal standards are open to revision in every case, deciding cases becomes a mere exercise of judicial will, with arbitrary and unpredictable results. But stare decisis is not the only constraint upon judicial decisionmaking. Cases  like this one  that involve our assumed power to set aside on grounds of unconstitutionality a state or federal statute representing the democratically expressed will of the people call other considerations into play. Because the Constitution itself is ordained and established by the people of the United States, constitutional adjudication by this Court does not, in theory at any rate, frustrate the authority of the people to govern themselves through institutions of their own devising and in accordance with principles of their own choosing. But decisions that find in the Constitution principles or values that cannot fairly be read into that document usurp the people's authority, for such decisions represent choices that the people have never made and that they cannot disavow through corrective legislation. For this reason, it is essential that this Court maintain the power to restore authority to its proper possessors by correcting constitutional decisions that, on reconsideration, are found to be mistaken.
The Court has therefore adhered to the rule that stare decisis is not rigidly applied in cases involving constitutional issues, see Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 543 (1962) (opinion of Harlan, J.), and has not hesitated to overrule decisions, or even whole lines of cases, where experience, scholarship, and reflection demonstrated that their fundamental premises were not to be found in the Constitution. Stare decisis did not stand in the way of the Justices who, in the late 1930's, swept away constitutional doctrines that had placed unwarranted restrictions on the power of the State and Federal Governments to enact social and economic legislation, see United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100 (1941); West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379 (1937). Nor did stare decisis deter a different set of Justices, some 15 years *788 later, from rejecting the theretofore prevailing view that the Fourteenth Amendment permitted the States to maintain the system of racial segregation. Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). In both instances, history has been far kinder to those who departed from precedent than to those who would have blindly followed the rule of stare decisis. And only last Term, the author of today's majority opinion reminded us once again that ""when it has become apparent that a prior decision has departed from a proper understanding"" of the Constitution, that decision must be overruled. Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U.S. 528, 557 (1985).
In my view, the time has come to recognize that Roe v. Wade, no less than the cases overruled by the Court in the decisions I have just cited, ""departs from a proper understanding"" of the Constitution and to overrule it. I do not claim that the arguments in support of this proposition are new ones or that they were not considered by the Court in Roe or in the cases that succeeded it. Cf. Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416, 419-420 (1983). But if an argument that a constitutional decision is erroneous must be novel in order to justify overruling that precedent, the Court's decisions in Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45 (1905), and Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896), would remain the law, for the doctrines announced in those decisions were nowhere more eloquently or incisively criticized than in the dissenting opinions of Justices Holmes (in Lochner) and Harlan (in both cases). That the flaws in an opinion were evident at the time it was handed down is hardly a reason for adhering to it.

A
Roe v. Wade posits that a woman has a fundamental right to terminate her pregnancy, and that this right may be restricted only in the service of two compelling state interests: the interest in maternal health (which becomes compelling *789 only at the stage in pregnancy at which an abortion becomes more hazardous than carrying the pregnancy to term) and the interest in protecting the life of the fetus (which becomes compelling only at the point of viability). A reader of the Constitution might be surprised to find that it encompassed these detailed rules, for the text obviously contains no references to abortion, nor, indeed, to pregnancy or reproduction generally; and, of course, it is highly doubtful that the authors of any of the provisions of the Constitution believed that they were giving protection to abortion. As its prior cases clearly show, however, this Court does not subscribe to the simplistic view that constitutional interpretation can possibly be limited to the ""plain meaning"" of the Constitution's text or to the subjective intention of the Framers. The Constitution is not a deed setting forth the precise metes and bounds of its subject matter; rather, it is a document announcing fundamental principles in value-laden terms that leave ample scope for the exercise of normative judgment by those charged with interpreting and applying it. In particular, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which forbids the deprivation of ""life, liberty, or property without due process of law,"" has been read by the majority of the Court to be broad enough to provide substantive protection against state infringement of a broad range of individual interests. See Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 541-552 (1977) (WHITE, J., dissenting).
In most instances, the substantive protection afforded the liberty or property of an individual by the Fourteenth Amendment is extremely limited: State action impinging on individual interests need only be rational to survive scrutiny under the Due Process Clause, and the determination of rationality is to be made with a heavy dose of deference to the policy choices of the legislature. Only ""fundamental"" rights are entitled to the added protection provided by strict judicial scrutiny of legislation that impinges upon them. See id., at 499 (opinion of POWELL, J.); id., at 537 (Stewart, J., joined by *790 REHNQUIST, J., dissenting); id., at 547-549 (WHITE, J., dissenting). I can certainly agree with the proposition  which I deem indisputable  that a woman's ability to choose an abortion is a species of ""liberty"" that is subject to the general protections of the Due Process Clause. I cannot agree, however, that this liberty is so ""fundamental"" that restrictions upon it call into play anything more than the most minimal judicial scrutiny.
Fundamental liberties and interests are most clearly present when the Constitution provides specific textual recognition of their existence and importance. Thus, the Court is on relatively firm ground when it deems certain of the liberties set forth in the Bill of Rights to be fundamental and therefore finds them incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee that no State may deprive any person of liberty without due process of law. When the Court ventures further and defines as ""fundamental"" liberties that are nowhere mentioned in the Constitution (or that are present only in the so-called ""penumbras"" of specifically enumerated rights), it must, of necessity, act with more caution, lest it open itself to the accusation that, in the name of identifying constitutional principles to which the people have consented in framing their Constitution, the Court has done nothing more than impose its own controversial choices of value upon the people.
Attempts to articulate the constraints that must operate upon the Court when it employs the Due Process Clause to protect liberties not specifically enumerated in the text of the Constitution have produced varying definitions of ""fundamental liberties."" One approach has been to limit the class of fundamental liberties to those interests that are ""implicit in the concept of ordered liberty"" such that ""neither liberty nor justice would exist if [they] were sacrificed."" Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325, 326 (1937); see Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S., at 537 (Stewart, J., joined by REHNQUIST, J., dissenting). Another, broader approach is *791 to define fundamental liberties as those that are ""deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition."" Id., at 503 (opinion of POWELL, J.); see also Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 501 (1965) (Harlan, J., concurring). These distillations of the possible approaches to the identification of unenumerated fundamental rights are not and do not purport to be precise legal tests or ""mechanical yardstick[s],"" Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 544 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting). Their utility lies in their effort to identify some source of constitutional value that reflects not the philosophical predilections of individual judges, but basic choices made by the people themselves in constituting their system of government  ""the balance struck by this country,"" id., at 542 (emphasis added)  and they seek to achieve this end through locating fundamental rights either in the traditions and consensus of our society as a whole or in the logical implications of a system that recognizes both individual liberty and democratic order. Whether either of these approaches can, as Justice Harlan hoped, prevent ""judges from roaming at large in the constitutional field,"" Griswold, supra, at 502, is debatable. What for me is not subject to debate, however, is that either of the basic definitions of fundamental liberties, taken seriously, indicates the illegitimacy of the Court's decision in Roe v. Wade.
The Court has justified the recognition of a woman's fundamental right to terminate her pregnancy by invoking decisions upholding claims of personal autonomy in connection with the conduct of family life, the rearing of children, marital privacy, the use of contraceptives, and the preservation of the individual's capacity to procreate. See Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U.S. 678 (1977); Moore v. East Cleveland, supra; Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972); Griswold v. Connecticut, supra; Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535 (1942); Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923). Even if each of these cases was correctly decided *792 and could be properly grounded in rights that are ""implicit in the concept of ordered liberty"" or ""deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition,"" the issues in the cases cited differ from those at stake where abortion is concerned. As the Court appropriately recognized in Roe v. Wade, ""[t]he pregnant woman cannot be isolated in her privacy,"" 410 U.S., at 159; the termination of a pregnancy typically involves the destruction of another entity: the fetus. However one answers the metaphysical or theological question whether the fetus is a ""human being"" or the legal question whether it is a ""person"" as that term is used in the Constitution, one must at least recognize, first, that the fetus is an entity that bears in its cells all the genetic information that characterizes a member of the species homo sapiens and distinguishes an individual member of that species from all others, and second, that there is no nonarbitrary line separating a fetus from a child or, indeed, an adult human being. Given that the continued existence and development  that is to say, the life  of such an entity are so directly at stake in the woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy, that decision must be recognized as sui generis, different in kind from the others that the Court has protected under the rubric of personal or family privacy and autonomy.[2] Accordingly, the *793 decisions cited by the Court both in Roe and in its opinion today as precedent for the fundamental nature of the liberty to choose abortion do not, even if all are accepted as valid, dictate the Court's classification.
If the woman's liberty to choose an abortion is fundamental, then, it is not because any of our precedents (aside from Roe itself) command or justify that result; it can only be because protection for this unique choice is itself ""implicit in the concept of ordered liberty"" or, perhaps, ""deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition."" It seems clear to me that it is neither. The Court's opinion in Roe itself convincingly refutes the notion that the abortion liberty is deeply rooted in the history or tradition of our people, as does the continuing and deep division of the people themselves over the question of abortion. As for the notion that choice in the matter of abortion is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, it seems apparent to me that a free, egalitarian, and democratic society does not presuppose any particular rule or set of rules with respect to abortion. And again, the fact that many men and women of good will and high commitment to constitutional government place themselves on both sides of the abortion controversy strengthens my own conviction that the values animating the Constitution do not compel recognition *794 of the abortion liberty as fundamental. In so denominating that liberty, the Court engages not in constitutional interpretation, but in the unrestrained imposition of its own, extraconstitutional value preferences.[3]

B
A second, equally basic error infects the Court's decision in Roe v. Wade. The detailed set of rules governing state restrictions on abortion that the Court first articulated in Roe and has since refined and elaborated presupposes not only that the woman's liberty to choose an abortion is fundamental, but also that the State's countervailing interest in protecting fetal life (or, as the Court would have it, ""potential human life,"" 410 U.S., at 159) becomes ""compelling"" only at the point at which the fetus is viable. As JUSTICE O'CONNOR pointed out three years ago in her dissent in Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S., at 461, the Court's choice of viability as the point at which the State's interest becomes compelling is entirely arbitrary. The Court's ""explanation"" for the line it has drawn is that the State's interest becomes compelling at viability ""because the fetus then presumably has the capacity of meaningful life outside the mother's womb."" 410 U.S., at 163. As one critic *795 of Roe has observed, this argument ""mistakes a definition for a syllogism."" Ely, The Wages of Crying Wolf: A Comment on Roe v. Wade, 82 Yale L. J. 920, 924 (1973).
The governmental interest at issue is in protecting those who will be citizens if their lives are not ended in the womb. The substantiality of this interest is in no way dependent on the probability that the fetus may be capable of surviving outside the womb at any given point in its development, as the possibility of fetal survival is contingent on the state of medical practice and technology, factors that are in essence morally and constitutionally irrelevant. The State's interest is in the fetus as an entity in itself, and the character of this entity does not change at the point of viability under conventional medical wisdom. Accordingly, the State's interest, if compelling after viability, is equally compelling before viability.[4]


*796 C
Both the characterization of the abortion liberty as fundamental and the denigration of the State's interest in preserving the lives of nonviable fetuses are essential to the detailed set of constitutional rules devised by the Court to limit the States' power to regulate abortion. If either or both of these facets of Roe v. Wade were rejected, a broad range of limitations on abortion (including outright prohibition) that are now unavailable to the States would again become constitutional possibilities.
In my view, such a state of affairs would be highly desirable from the standpoint of the Constitution. Abortion is a hotly contested moral and political issue. Such issues, in our society, are to be resolved by the will of the people, either as expressed through legislation or through the general principles they have already incorporated into the Constitution they have adopted.[5]Roe v. Wade implies that the people *797 have already resolved the debate by weaving into the Constitution the values and principles that answer the issue. As I have argued, I believe it is clear that the people have never  not in 1787, 1791, 1868, or at any time since  done any such thing. I would return the issue to the people by overruling Roe v. Wade.

II
As it has evolved in the decisions of this Court, the freedom recognized by the Court in Roe v. Wade and its progeny is essentially a negative one, based not on the notion that abortion is a good in itself, but only on the view that the legitimate goals that may be served by state coercion of private choices regarding abortion are, at least under some circumstances, outweighed by the damage to individual autonomy and privacy that such coercion entails. In other words, the evil of abortion does not justify the evil of forbidding it. Cf. Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557 (1969). But precisely because Roe v. Wade is not premised on the notion that abortion is itself desirable (either as a matter of constitutional entitlement or of social policy), the decision does not command the States to fund or encourage abortion, or even to approve *798 of it. Rather, we have recognized that the States may legitimately adopt a policy of encouraging normal childbirth rather than abortion so long as the measures through which that policy is implemented do not amount to direct compulsion of the woman's choice regarding abortion. Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980); Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464 (1977); Beal v. Doe, 432 U.S. 438 (1977). The provisions before the Court today quite obviously represent the State's effort to implement such a policy.
The majority's opinion evinces no deference toward the State's legitimate policy. Rather, the majority makes it clear from the outset that it simply disapproves of any attempt by Pennsylvania to legislate in this area. The history of the state legislature's decade-long effort to pass a constitutional abortion statute is recounted as if it were evidence of some sinister conspiracy. See ante, at 751-752. In fact, of course, the legislature's past failure to predict the evolution of the right first recognized in Roe v. Wade is understandable and is in itself no ground for condemnation. Moreover, the legislature's willingness to pursue permissible policies through means that go to the limits allowed by existing precedents is no sign of mens rea. The majority, however, seems to find it necessary to respond by changing the rules to invalidate what before would have seemed permissible. The result is a decision that finds no justification in the Court's previous holdings, departs from sound principles of constitutional and statutory interpretation, and unduly limits the State's power to implement the legitimate (and in some circumstances compelling) policy of encouraging normal childbirth in preference to abortion.

A
The Court begins by striking down statutory provisions designed to ensure that the woman's choice of an abortion is fully informed  that is, that she is aware not only of the reasons for having an abortion, but also of the risks associated with an abortion and the availability of assistance that might *799 make the alternative of normal childbirth more attractive than it might otherwise appear. At first blush, the Court's action seems extraordinary: after all, Roe v. Wade purports to be about freedom of choice, and statutory provisions requiring that a woman seeking an abortion be afforded information regarding her decision not only do not limit her ability to choose abortion, but also would appear to enhance her freedom of choice by helping to ensure that her decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy is an informed one. Indeed, maximization of the patient's freedom of choice  not restriction of his or her liberty  is generally perceived to be the principal value justifying the imposition of disclosure requirements upon physicians:
""The root premise is the concept, fundamental in American jurisprudence, that `[e]very human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body. . . .' True consent to what happens to one's self is the informed exercise of a choice, and that entails an opportunity to evaluate knowledgeably the options available and the risks attendant upon each. The average patient has little or no understanding of the medical arts, and ordinarily has only his physician to whom he can look for enlightenment with which to reach an intelligent decision. From these almost axiomatic considerations springs the need, and in turn the requirement, of a reasonable divulgence by physician to patient to make such a decision possible."" Canterbury v. Spence, 150 U. S. App. D. C. 263, 271, 464 F.2d 772, 780 (1972).
One searches the majority's opinion in vain for a convincing reason why the apparently laudable policy of promoting informed consent becomes unconstitutional when the subject is abortion. The majority purports to find support in Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416 (1983). But Akron is not controlling. The informed-consent *800 provisions struck down in that case, as characterized by the majority, required the physician to advance tendentious statements concerning the unanswerable question of when human life begins, to offer merely speculative descriptions of the anatomical features of the fetus carried by the woman seeking the abortion, and to recite a ""parade of horribles"" suggesting that abortion is ""a particularly dangerous procedure."" Id., at 444-445. I have no quarrel with the general proposition, for which I read Akron to stand, that a campaign of state-promulgated disinformation cannot be justified in the name of ""informed consent"" or ""freedom of choice."" But the Pennsylvania statute before us cannot be accused of sharing the flaws of the ordinance at issue in Akron. As the majority concedes, the statute does not, on its face, require that the patient be given any information that is false or unverifiable. Moreover, it is unquestionable that all of the information required would be relevant in many cases to a woman's decision whether or not to obtain an abortion.
Why, then, is the statute unconstitutional? The majority's argument, while primarily rhetorical, appears to offer three answers. First, the information that must be provided will in some cases be irrelevant to the woman's decision. This is true. Its pertinence to the question of the statute's constitutionality, however, is beyond me. Legislators are ordinarily entitled to proceed on the basis of rational generalizations about the subject matter of legislation, and the existence of particular cases in which a feature of a statute performs no function (or is even counterproductive) ordinarily does not render the statute unconstitutional or even constitutionally suspect. Only where the statute is subject to heightened scrutiny by virtue of its impingement on some fundamental right or its employment of a suspect classification does the imprecision of the ""fit"" between the statute's ends and means become potentially damning. Here, there is nothing to trigger such scrutiny, for the statute does not directly *801 infringe the allegedly fundamental right at issue  the woman's right to choose an abortion. Indeed, I fail to see how providing a woman with accurate information  whether relevant or irrelevant  could ever be deemed to impair any constitutionally protected interest (even if, as the majority hypothesizes, the information may upset her). Thus, the majority's observation that the statute may require the provision of irrelevant information in some cases is itself an irrelevancy.
Second, the majority appears to reason that the informed-consent provisions are invalid because the information they require may increase the woman's ""anxiety"" about the procedure and even ""influence"" her in her choice. Again, both observations are undoubtedly true; but they by no means cast the constitutionality of the provisions into question. It is in the very nature of informed-consent provisions that they may produce some anxiety in the patient and influence her in her choice. This is in fact their reason for existence, and  provided that the information required is accurate and nonmisleading  it is an entirely salutary reason. If information may reasonably affect the patient's choice, the patient should have that information; and, as one authority has observed, ""the greater the likelihood that particular information will influence [the patient's] decision, the more essential the information arguably becomes for securing her informed consent."" Appleton, Doctors, Patients and the Constitution, 63 Wash. U. L. Q. 183, 211 (1985). That the result of the provision of information may be that some women will forgo abortions by no means suggests that providing the information is unconstitutional, for the ostensible objective of Roe v. Wade is not maximizing the number of abortions, but maximizing choice. Moreover, our decisions in Maher, Beal, and Harris v. McRae all indicate that the State may encourage women to make their choice in favor of childbirth rather than abortion, and the provision of accurate information regarding abortion *802 and its alternatives is a reasonable and fair means of achieving that objective.
Third, the majority concludes that the informed-consent provisions are invalid because they ""intrud[e] upon the discretion of the pregnant woman's physician,"" ante, at 762, violate ""the privacy of the informed-consent dialogue between the woman and her physician,"" ibid., and ""officially structur[e]"" that dialogue, ante, at 763. The provisions thus constitute ""state medicine"" that ""infringes upon [the physician's] professional responsibilities."" Ibid. This is nonsensical. I can concede that the Constitution extends its protection to certain zones of personal autonomy and privacy, see Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S., at 502 (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment), and I can understand, if not share, the notion that that protection may extend to a woman's decision regarding abortion. But I cannot concede the possibility that the Constitution provides more than minimal protection for the manner in which a physician practices his or her profession or for the ""dialogues"" in which he or she chooses to participate in the course of treating patients. I had thought it clear that regulation of the practice of medicine, like regulation of other professions and of economic affairs generally, was a matter peculiarly within the competence of legislatures, and that such regulation was subject to review only for rationality. See, e. g., Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc., 348 U.S. 483 (1955).
Were the Court serious about the need for strict scrutiny of regulations that infringe on the ""judgment"" of medical professionals, ""structure"" their relations with their patients, and amount to ""state medicine,"" there is no telling how many state and federal statutes (not to mention principles of state tort law) governing the practice of medicine might be condemned. And of course, there would be no reason why a concern for professional freedom could be confined to the medical profession: nothing in the Constitution indicates a preference for the liberty of doctors over that of lawyers, *803 accountants, bakers, or brickmakers. Accordingly, if the State may not ""structure"" the dialogue between doctor and patient, it should also follow that the State may not, for example, require attorneys to disclose to their clients information concerning the risks of representing the client in a particular proceeding. Of course, we upheld such disclosure requirements only last Term. See Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel, 471 U.S. 626 (1985).
The rationale for state efforts to regulate the practice of a profession or vocation is simple: the government is entitled not to trust members of a profession to police themselves, and accordingly the legislature may for the most part impose such restrictions on the practice of a profession or business as it may find necessary to the protection of the public. This is precisely the rationale for infringing the professional freedom of doctors by imposing disclosure requirements upon them: ""Respect for the patient's right of self-determination on particular therapy demands a standard set by law for physicians rather than one which physicians may or may not impose upon themselves."" Canterbury v. Spence, 150 U. S. App. D. C., at 275, 464 F.2d, at 784. Unless one is willing to recast entirely the law with respect to the legitimacy of state regulation of professional conduct, the obvious rationality of the policy of promoting informed patient choice on the subject of abortion must defeat any claim that the disclosure requirements imposed by Pennsylvania are invalid because they infringe on ""professional freedom"" or on the ""physician-patient relationship.""
I do not really believe that the Court's invocation of professional freedom signals a retreat from the principle that the Constitution is largely unconcerned with the substantive aspects of governmental regulation of professional and business relations. Clearly, the majority is uninterested in undermining the edifice of post-New Deal constitutional law by extending its holding to cases that do not concern the issue of abortion. But if one assumes, as I do, that the majority *804 is unwilling to commit itself to the implications of that part of its rhetoric which smacks of economic due process rights for physicians, it becomes obvious that the talk of ""infringement of professional responsibility"" is mere window dressing for a holding that must stand or fall on other grounds. And because the informed-consent provisions do not infringe the essential right at issue  the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion  the majority's conclusion that the provisions are unconstitutional is without foundation.

B
The majority's decision to strike down the reporting requirements of the statute is equally extraordinary. The requirements obviously serve legitimate purposes. The information contained in the reports is highly relevant to the State's efforts to enforce § 3210(a) of the statute, which forbids abortion of viable fetuses except when necessary to the mother's health. The information concerning complications plainly serves the legitimate goal of advancing the state of medical knowledge concerning maternal and fetal health. See Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U. S., at 80. Given that the subject of abortion is a matter of considerable public interest and debate (constrained to some extent, of course, by the pre-emptive effect of this Court's ill-conceived constitutional decisions), the collection and dissemination of demographic information concerning abortions is clearly a legitimate goal of public policy. Moreover, there is little reason to believe that the required reports, though fairly detailed, would impose an undue burden on physicians and impede the ability of their patients to obtain abortions, as all of the information required would necessarily be readily available to a physician who had performed an abortion. Accordingly, under this Court's prior decisions in this area, the reporting requirements are constitutional. Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Missouri, Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U.S. 476, 486-490 (1983) (opinion of POWELL, *805 J.); id., at 505 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.); Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, supra, at 79-81.
Nonetheless, the majority strikes down the reporting requirements because it finds that notwithstanding the explicit statutory command that the reports be made public only in a manner ensuring anonymity, ""the amount of information about [the patient] and the circumstances under which she had an abortion are so detailed that identification is likely,"" ante, at 767, and that ""[i]dentification is the obvious purpose of these extreme reporting requirements,"" ibid. Where these ""findings"" come from is mysterious, to say the least. The Court of Appeals did not make any such findings on the record before it, and the District Court expressly found that ""the requirements of confidentiality in § 3214(e) regarding the identity of both patient and physician prevent any invasion of privacy which could present a legally significant burden on the abortion decision."" 552 F. Supp. 791, 804 (ED Pa. 1982). Rather than pointing to anything in the record that demonstrates that the District Court's conclusion is erroneous, the majority resorts to the handy, but mistaken, solution of substituting its own view of the facts and strikes down the statute.
I can accept the proposition that a statute whose purpose and effect are to allow harassment and intimidation of citizens for their constitutionally protected conduct is unconstitutional, but the majority's action in striking down the Pennsylvania statute on this basis is procedurally and substantively indefensible. First, it reflects a complete disregard for the principle, embodied in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), that an appellate court must defer to a trial court's findings of facts unless those findings are clearly erroneous. The Rule is expressly applicable to findings of fact that constitute the grounds for a district court's action granting or refusing a preliminary injunction, and, of course, the Rule limits this Court to the same degree as it does any other *806 federal appellate court, see United States v. General Dynamics Corp., 415 U.S. 486 (1974).
Second, the majority has seriously erred in purporting to make a final determination of fact, conclusive of the constitutionality of the statute, on a motion for preliminary injunction. In so doing, the Court overlooks the principle that although a district court's findings of fact on a motion for a preliminary injunction are entitled to deference on appeal from the grant or denial of preliminary relief, ""the findings of fact . . . made by a court granting a preliminary injunction are not binding at trial on the merits"" because ""a preliminary injunction is customarily granted on the basis of procedures that are less formal and evidence that is less complete than in a trial on the merits."" University of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981) (emphasis added). What Camenisch stated to be true customarily is also true in this case: the record on which the motion for preliminary injunction was decided in the trial court consisted solely of affidavits and a stipulation of undisputed facts, none of which provides a sufficient basis for a conclusive finding on the complex question of the motive and effect of the reporting requirements and the adequacy of the statute's protection of the anonymity of doctors and patients. Issuing what amounts to a final declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of the statute under these circumstances is highly inappropriate.
Finally, in addition to being procedurally flawed, the majority's holding is substantively suspect. The information contained in the reports identifies the patient on the basis of age, race, marital status, and ""political subdivision"" of residence; the remainder of the information included in the reports concerns the medical aspects of the abortion. It is implausible that a particular patient could be identified on the basis of the combination of the general identifying information and the specific medical information in these reports by anyone who did not already know (at a minimum) that the woman had been pregnant and obtained an abortion. *807 Accordingly, the provisions pose little or no threat to the woman's privacy.
In sum, there is no basis here even for a preliminary injunction against the reporting provisions of the statute, much less for a final determination that the provisions are unconstitutional.

C
The majority resorts to linguistic nit-picking in striking down the provision requiring physicians aborting viable fetuses to use the method of abortion most likely to result in fetal survival unless that method would pose a ""significantly greater medical risk to the life or health of the pregnant woman"" than would other available methods. The majority concludes that the statute's use of the word ""significantly"" indicates that the statute represents an unlawful ""trade-off"" between the woman's health and the chance of fetal survival. Not only is this conclusion based on a wholly unreasonable interpretation of the statute, but the statute would also be constitutional even if it meant what the majority says it means.
The majority adopts the Court of Appeals' view that the statute's use of the term ""significantly"" renders it "" `not susceptible to a construction that does not require the mother to bear an increased medical risk in order to save her viable fetus.' "" Ante, at 769 (quoting 737 F.2d 283, 300 (CA3 1984)). The term ""significant"" in this context, however, is most naturally read as synonymous with the terms ""meaningful,"" ""cognizable,"" ""appreciable,"" or ""nonnegligible."" That is, the statute requires only that the risk be a real and identifiable one. Surely, if the State's interest in preserving the life of a viable fetus is, as Roe purported to recognize, a compelling one, the State is at the very least entitled to demand that that interest not be subordinated to a purported maternal health risk that is in fact wholly insubstantial. The statute, on its face, demands no more than this of a doctor performing an abortion of a viable fetus.
*808 Even if the Pennsylvania statute is properly interpreted as requiring a pregnant woman seeking abortion of a viable fetus to endure a method of abortion chosen to protect the health of the fetus despite the existence of an alternative that in some substantial degree is more protective of her own health, I am not convinced that the statute is unconstitutional. The Court seems to read its earlier opinion in Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379 (1979), as incorporating a holding that tradeoffs between the health of the pregnant woman and the survival of her viable fetus are constitutionally impermissible under Roe v. Wade. Of course, Colautti held no such thing: the Court there stated only that it did not address the ""serious ethical and constitutional difficulties"" that such a tradeoff would present. 439 U.S., at 400.[6] Nothing in Colautti or any of the Court's previous abortion decisions compels the per se ""tradeoff"" rule the Court adopts today.
The Court's ruling in this respect is not even consistent with its decision in Roe v. Wade. In Roe, the Court conceded that the State's interest in preserving the life of a viable fetus is a compelling one, and the Court has never disavowed that concession. The Court now holds that this compelling interest cannot justify any regulation that imposes a quantifiable medical risk upon the pregnant woman who seeks to abort a viable fetus: if attempting to save the fetus imposes any additional risk of injury to the woman, she must be permitted to kill it. This holding hardly accords with the usual understanding of the term ""compelling interest,"" which we have used to describe those governmental interests that are so weighty as to justify substantial and ordinarily impermissible impositions on the individual  impositions that, I had thought, could include the infliction of *809 some degree of risk of physical harm. The most obvious illustration of this principle may be found in the opinion of the elder Justice Harlan in Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 29 (1905): ""The liberty secured by the Fourteenth Amendment . . . consists, in part, in the right of a person `to live and work where he will,' Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U.S. 578; and yet he may be compelled, by force if need be, against his will and without regard to his personal wishes or his pecuniary interests, . . . to take his place in the ranks of the army of his country and risk the chance of being shot down in its defense."" The actual holding of Jacobson provides another illustration, more pertinent to this particular case: the Court there sustained a regulation requiring all adult citizens of Cambridge, Massachusetts, to be vaccinated against smallpox, notwithstanding that exposure to vaccination carried with it a statistical possibility of serious illness and even death. If, as I believe these examples demonstrate, a compelling state interest may justify the imposition of some physical danger upon an individual, and if, as the Court has held, the State has a compelling interest in the preservation of the life of a viable fetus, I find the majority's unwillingness to tolerate the imposition of any nonnegligible risk of injury to a pregnant woman in order to protect the life of her viable fetus in the course of an abortion baffling.
The Court's ruling today that any tradeoff between the woman's health and fetal survival is impermissible is not only inconsistent with Roe's recognition of a compelling state interest in viable fetal life; it directly contradicts one of the essential holdings of Roe  that is, that the State may forbid all postviability abortions except when necessary to protect the life or health of the pregnant woman. As is evident, this holding itself involves a tradeoff between maternal health and protection of the fetus, for it plainly permits the State to forbid a postviability abortion even when such an abortion may be statistically safer than carrying the pregnancy to *810 term, provided that the abortion is not medically necessary.[7] The tradeoff contained in the Pennsylvania statute, even as interpreted by the majority, is no different in kind: the State has simply required that when an abortion of some kind is medically necessary, it shall be conducted so as to spare the fetus (to the greatest degree possible) unless a method less protective of the fetus is itself to some degree medically necessary for the woman. That this choice may involve the imposition of some risk on the woman undergoing the abortion should be no more troublesome than that a prohibition on nonnecessary postviability abortions may involve the imposition of some risk on women who are thereby forced to continue their pregnancies to term; yet for some reason, the Court concludes that whereas the tradeoffs it devises are compelled by the Constitution, the essentially indistinguishable tradeoff the State has attempted is foreclosed. This cannot be the law.
The framework of rights and interests devised by the Court in Roe v. Wade indicates that just as a State may prohibit a postviability abortion unless it is necessary to protect the life or health of the woman, the State may require that postviability abortions be conducted using the method most protective of the fetus unless a less protective method is necessary to protect the life or health of the woman. Under this standard, the Pennsylvania statute  which does not require the woman to accept any significant health risks to protect the fetus  is plainly constitutional.

D
The Court strikes down the statute's second-physician requirement because, in its view, the existence of a medical emergency requiring an immediate abortion to save the life of the pregnant woman would not be a defense to a prosecution *811 under the statute. The Court does not question the proposition, established in the Ashcroft case, that a second-physician requirement accompanied by an exception for emergencies is a permissible means of vindicating the compelling state interest in protecting the lives of viable fetuses. Accordingly, the majority's ruling on this issue does not on its face involve a substantial departure from the Court's previous decisions.
What is disturbing about the Court's opinion on this point is not the general principle on which it rests, but the manner in which that principle is applied. The Court brushes aside the fact that the section of the statute in which the second-physician requirement is imposed states that ""[i]t shall be a complete defense to any charge brought against a physician for violating the requirements of this section that he had concluded, in good faith, in his best medical judgment, . . . that the abortion was necessary to preserve maternal life or health"" (emphasis added). 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 3210(a) (1982). This language is obviously susceptible of the construction the State advances: namely, that it is a defense to a charge of violating the second-physician requirement that the physician performing the abortion believed that performing an abortion in the absence of a second physician was necessary to the life or health of the mother.
The Court's rejection of this construction is based on its conclusion that the statutory language ""does not relate to the second-physician requirement"" and that ""its words are not words of emergency."" Ante, at 771. This reasoning eludes me. The defense of medical necessity ""relates"" to any charge that a doctor has violated one of the requirements of the section in which it appears, and the second-physician requirement is imposed by that section. The defense thus quite evidently ""relates"" to the second-physician requirement. True, the ""words"" of the defense are not ""words of emergency,"" but words of necessity. Why this should make a difference is unclear: a defense of medical necessity is fully as protective of the interests of the pregnant woman as a defense of *812 ""emergency."" The Court falls back, ibid., on the notion that the legislature ""knows how to provide a medical-emergency exception when it chooses to do so."" No doubt. But the legislature obviously also ""knows how"" to provide a medical-necessity exception, and it has done so. Why this exception is insufficient is unexplained and inexplicable.
The Court's rejection of a perfectly plausible reading of the statute flies in the face of the principle  which until today I had thought applicable to abortion statutes as well as to other legislative enactments  that ""[w]here fairly possible, courts should construe a statute to avoid a danger of unconstitutionality."" Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Missouri, Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U. S., at 493. The Court's reading is obviously based on an entirely different principle: that in cases involving abortion, a permissible reading of a statute is to be avoided at all costs. Not sharing this viewpoint, I cannot accept the majority's conclusion that the statute does not provide for the equivalent of a defense of emergency.[8]

E
Finally, the majority refuses to vacate the preliminary injunction entered against the enforcement of the parental notice and consent provisions of the statute. See ante, at 758, n. 9. The reason offered is that the propriety of the injunction depends upon the adequacy of the rules, recently promulgated by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, setting forth *813 procedures by which a minor desiring an abortion may speedily and confidentially obtain either judicial approval of her decision to obtain an abortion or a judicial determination that she herself is capable of an informed consent to the procedure. The Court concludes that review of the rules is best carried out in the first instance in the District Court.
The Court's decision in Ashcroft, however, compels the conclusion that the Third Circuit erred in directing that the operation of the parental notice and consent provisions be enjoined pending promulgation of the required rules; accordingly, the injunction should be vacated irrespective of the adequacy of those rules. As the Court of Appeals apparently recognized, the Pennsylvania statute, on its face, is substantively identical to that upheld by the Court in Ashcroft; thus, the sole basis for the injunction ordered by the Court of Appeals was the absence of procedural rules implementing the statute. What the Court of Appeals failed to recognize was that this Court denied relief to the plaintiffs challenging the statute in Ashcroft despite the same purported defect: in that case, as in this, the State Supreme Court had not yet promulgated rules establishing the expedited procedures called for by the statute. Nonetheless, as JUSTICE POWELL's opinion explained, the plaintiffs were not entitled to any relief against enforcement of the statutory scheme, as ""[t]here is no reason to believe that [the State] will not expedite any appeal consistent with the mandate in our prior opinions."" 462 U.S., at 491, n. 16. Similarly, there was no reason here for the Court of Appeals to believe that Pennsylvania would not provide for the adequate, expedited procedures contemplated by the statute; thus, its entry of an injunction against enforcement of the statute was erroneous.

III
The decision today appears symptomatic of the Court's own insecurity over its handiwork in Roe v. Wade and the cases following that decision. Aware that in Roe it essentially *814A created something out of nothing and that there are many in this country who hold that decision to be basically illegitimate, the Court responds defensively. Perceiving, in a statute implementing the State's legitimate policy of preferring childbirth to abortion, a threat to or criticism of the decision in Roe v. Wade, the majority indiscriminately strikes down statutory provisions that in no way contravene the right recognized in Roe. I do not share the warped point of view of the majority, nor can I follow the tortuous path the majority treads in proceeding to strike down the statute before us. I dissent.
*814B JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE REHNQUIST joins, dissenting.
This Court's abortion decisions have already worked a major distortion in the Court's constitutional jurisprudence. See Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416, 452 (1983) (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). Today's decision goes further, and makes it painfully clear that no legal rule or doctrine is safe from ad hoc nullification by this Court when an occasion for its application arises in a case involving state regulation of abortion. The permissible scope of abortion regulation is not the only constitutional issue on which this Court is divided, but  except when it comes to abortion  the Court has generally refused to let such disagreements, however longstanding or deeply felt, prevent it from evenhandedly applying uncontroversial legal doctrines to cases that come before it. See Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 838 (1985); id., at 839-840, n. 2 (BRENNAN, J., concurring) (differences over the validity of the death penalty under the Eighth Amendment should not influence the Court's consideration of a question of statutory administrative law). That the Court's unworkable scheme for constitutionalizing the regulation of abortion has had this institutionally debilitating effect should not be surprising, however, since the Court is not suited to the expansive role it *815 has claimed for itself in the series of cases that began with Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973).
The Court today holds that ""[t]he Court of Appeals correctly invalidated the specified provisions of Pennsylvania's 1982 Abortion Control Act."" Ante, at 772. In so doing, the Court prematurely decides serious constitutional questions on an inadequate record, in contravention of settled principles of constitutional adjudication and procedural fairness. The constitutionality of the challenged provisions was not properly before the Court of Appeals, and is not properly before this Court. There has been no trial on the merits, and appellants have had no opportunity to develop facts that might have a bearing on the constitutionality of the statute. The only question properly before the Court is whether or not a preliminary injunction should have been issued to restrain enforcement of the challenged provisions pending trial on the merits. This Court's decisions in Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, supra, Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Missouri, Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U.S. 476 (1983), and Simopoulos v. Virginia, 462 U.S. 506 (1983), do not establish a likelihood that appellees would succeed on the merits of their constitutional claims sufficient to warrant overturning the District Court's denial of a preliminary injunction. Under the approach to abortion regulation outlined in my dissenting opinion in Akron, to which I adhere, it is even clearer that no preliminary injunction should have issued. I therefore dissent.

I
The only issue before the District Court in this case was whether to grant appellees' motion for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of Pennsylvania's Abortion Control Act. The limited record before the District Court consisted of affidavits submitted by appellees, the parties' memoranda of law, the Act itself, including the findings of the Pennsylvania Legislature, and a stipulation of uncontested facts. As *816 the District Judge noted, this stipulation ""was entered into solely for the purpose of the motion for preliminary injunction."" 552 F. Supp. 791, 794, n. 1 (ED Pa. 1982). Indeed, the parties expressly provided that the stipulation should be ""without prejudice to any party's right to controvert any facts or to prove any additional facts at any later proceeding in this action."" App. 9a-10a. In light of the stipulation of uncontested facts, no testimony or evidence was submitted at the hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction.
In these circumstances, the District Judge's consideration of the motion before him was governed by the black letter law recapitulated in University of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981):
""The purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held. Given this limited purpose, and given the haste that is often necessary if those positions are to be preserved, a preliminary injunction is customarily granted on the basis of procedures that are less formal and evidence that is less complete than in a trial on the merits. A party thus is not required to prove his case in full at a preliminary injunction hearing, and the findings of fact and conclusions of law made by a court granting a preliminary injunction are not binding at trial on the merits. In light of these considerations, it is generally inappropriate for a federal court at the preliminary-injunction stage to give a final judgment on the merits.
""Should an expedited decision on the merits be appropriate, Rule 65(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides a means of securing one. That Rule permits a court to `order the trial of the action on the merits to be advanced and consolidated with the hearing of the application.' Before such an order may issue, however, the courts have commonly required that `the parties should normally receive clear and unambiguous notice [of *817 the court's intent to consolidate the trial and the hearing] either before the hearing commences or at a time which will still afford the parties a full opportunity to present their respective cases' "" (citations omitted).
The District Judge scrupulously adhered to these settled principles. He granted the preliminary injunction as to one provision of the Act, and denied preliminary relief as to all the other challenged provisions. Having seen no occasion to issue a Rule 65 order, he properly refrained from rendering final judgment on the merits by declaratory judgment or otherwise. That the District Judge understood the preliminary nature of the proceedings, and ruled accordingly, is incontrovertible:
""I have applied the traditional criteria applicable to a motion for preliminary injunction: likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm if the relief is not granted, possibility of harm to the non-moving party, and where relevant, harm to the public. Given the importance of the right involved in this litigation, I have assumed that if the plaintiffs were able to show likelihood of success on the merits, then the irreparable harm requirement would be met. I conclude that in only one instance, the 24-hour waiting period, did the plaintiffs carry their burden of demonstrating likelihood of success on the merits.
.....
""My adjudication is limited to the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. It is circumscribed by the record produced by the parties and the arguments advanced in the briefs on this motion. After applying the criteria for a preliminary injunction, I conclude that the only portion of the Act which the plaintiffs have demonstrated should be preliminarily enjoined is the 24-hour waiting period. In all other respects, the plaintiffs have failed to show a right to a preliminary injunction pending *818 the outcome of the trial on the merits."" 552 F. Supp., at 811 (emphasis in original).
The District Judge correctly discerned that ""[t]he traditional standard for granting a preliminary injunction requires a plaintiff to show that in the absence of its issuance he will suffer irreparable injury and also that he is likely to prevail on the merits."" Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U.S. 922, 931 (1975). Unsurprisingly, the likelihood of success on the merits emerged, in the District Judge's view, as the most important factor in determining whether an injunction should issue in this case. In sum, when the District Judge denied appellees' motion for a preliminary injunction, he faithfully applied uncontroversial criteria for ruling on such motions and rendered a decision that ""was not in any sense intended as a final decision as to the constitutionality of the challenged statute."" Brown v. Chote, 411 U.S. 452, 456 (1973).
When the appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, that court's review should have been limited to determining whether the District Court had abused its discretion in denying preliminary relief. Doran, supra, at 931-932; Brown, supra, at 457. If the Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court had committed legal errors that infected its assessment of the likelihood that appellees would succeed on the merits, the Court of Appeals should then have addressed the remaining factors that make up the preliminary injunction inquiry. If it concluded that denial of the preliminary injunction was an abuse of discretion, it should have entered judgment providing for entry of a preliminary injunction. What it should not have done, and what it did do, was to issue a final, binding declaration on the merits of appellees' constitutional claims.
The Court concedes that a court of appeals should ordinarily review the denial of a preliminary injunction under an abuse of discretion standard, and it concedes that a court of appeals should ordinarily confine itself to assessing the ""probability that the plaintiffs would succeed on the merits."" *819 Ante, at 755. But the Court purports to find an exception to this rule in the decisions in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), and Smith v. Vulcan Iron Works, 165 U.S. 518 (1897). It asserts that these cases indicate that ""if a district court's ruling rests solely on a premise as to the applicable rule of law, and the facts are established or of no controlling relevance, that ruling may be reviewed even though the appeal is from the entry of a preliminary injunction."" Ante, at 757. The Court then announces that the requirement that appellate review proceed under the deferential abuse of discretion standard is ""a rule of orderly judicial administration, not a limit on judicial power."" Ibid. Postulating that the Court of Appeals had a ""full record before it on the issues now before us,"" ibid., the Court concludes that this ""full record,"" and the fact that this Court's decisions in Akron, Ashcroft, and Simopoulos were handed down during the pendency of the appeal, justified the Court of Appeals ""in proceeding to plenary review of those issues."" Ante, at 757.
This analysis mischaracterizes the proceedings in the District Court and is unsupported by precedent or logic. No one doubts that the legal premises on which the District Judge proceeded were reviewable. But the fact is that the District Judge did not make the final, definitive ""ruling"" on the merits the Court imputes to him. The only ""ruling"" the Court of Appeals had before it with respect to the merits was a determination of ""likelihood of success"" based on facts which were stipulated only for purposes of the preliminary injunction motion, and on arguments framed with a view toward only those facts. Nor was there a ""full record"" upon which the Court of Appeals could decide the merits. The Court falls into precisely the error pointed out in Camenisch, 451 U. S., at 394, where this Court unanimously rejected the proposition that determinations on the propriety of preliminary relief are ""tantamount to decisions on the underlying merits,"" because that view ""improperly equates `likelihood of *820 success' with `success,' and what is more important, . . . ignores the significant procedural differences between preliminary and permanent injunctions.""
The Court of Appeals was convinced that the District Judge, in reliance on the decisions of the Courts of Appeals that were later reviewed in Akron and Ashcroft, had taken a view of the applicable law which this Court's decisions in those cases demonstrated to be erroneous. Citing Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp., 714 F.2d 1240, 1242 (CA3 1983), cert. dism'd under this Court's Rule 53, 464 U.S. 1033 (1984), the Court of Appeals stated that ""[t]he customary discretion accorded to a district court's ruling on a preliminary injunction yields to our plenary scope of review as to the applicable law."" 737 F.2d 283, 290 (1984). Apple Computer, in turn, relied on Judge Friendly's opinion for the Second Circuit in Donovan v. Bierwirth, 680 F.2d 263, 269, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1069 (1982): ""Despite oft repeated statements that the issuance of a preliminary injunction rests in the discretion of the trial judge whose decisions will be reversed only for `abuse', a court of appeals must reverse if the district court has proceeded on the basis of an erroneous view of the applicable law, or of the standards governing the granting or denial of interlocutory relief"" (citations omitted).
Donovan's reasoning, however, goes only to the standard of appellate review, not to the extent of the issues to be reviewed. Whether or not Donovan's approach is sound, it is clear that a district court does not have discretion to rule on the basis of a misapprehension of controlling law. But even assuming, arguendo, that, where a court of appeals detects such an error, it may then engage in de novo review of the determination whether a preliminary injunction should issue, see 680 F.2d, at 270, such discretion does not ordinarily extend to deciding the merits of the controversy with finality. Judge Friendly did no such thing in Donovan, id., *821 at 276, nor did the Third Circuit in Apple Computer, see 714 F.2d, at 1242.
What is at issue here is a matter of legal principle. As JUSTICE BLACKMUN has observed on a previous occasion: ""The distinction between the preliminary and final injunction stages of a proceeding is more than mere formalism. The time pressures involved in a request for a preliminary injunction require courts to make determinations without the aid of full briefing or factual development, and make all such determinations necessarily provisional."" Firefighters v. Stotts, 467 U.S. 561, 603-604, n. 7 (1984) (dissenting opinion). The holding of the Court today thus comes at the expense of the basic principle underlying the framework set out in Camenisch for ruling on a motion for a preliminary injunction: that fairness to the parties and reliable adjudication of disputes require final, binding rulings on the merits of a controversy to be made only after each side has had an opportunity to establish its version of the disputed facts or to establish that the facts are not in dispute.
Equally neglected by the Court is a second principle, closely related to the first:
""Ordinarily an appellate court does not give consideration to issues not raised below. For our procedural scheme contemplates that parties shall come to issue in the trial forum vested with authority to determine questions of fact. This is essential in order that parties may have the opportunity to offer all the evidence they believe relevant to the issues which the trial tribunal is alone competent to decide; it is equally essential in order that litigants may not be surprised on appeal by final decision there of issues upon which they have had no opportunity to introduce evidence."" Hormel v. Helvering, 312 U.S. 552, 556 (1941).
See also Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 120-121 (1976); cf. Fountain v. Filson, 336 U.S. 681, 683 (1949) (per curiam) (reversing a summary judgment order ""made on appeal on a *822 new issue as to which the opposite party had no opportunity to present a defense before the trial court""). The cases on which the Court relies simply do not support the short shrift the Court gives these basic principles.
In Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co., President Truman, invoking an immediate threat to the national defense precipitated by a threatened nationwide strike in the steel industry, ordered the Secretary of Commerce to seize the steel mills and keep them running. 343 U.S., at 583. The steel companies sought a declaratory judgment, a preliminary injunction, and a permanent injunction against the seizure, on the grounds that the President had no authority to order it. Ibid. Although the District Court had before it only ""motions for temporary injunctions"" when it ruled, 103 F. Supp. 569, 572 (DC 1952), ""in the light of the facts presented, the District Court saw no reason for delaying decision of the constitutional validity of the orders."" Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co., supra, at 585. Indeed, the District Court had ""com[e] to a fixed conclusion . . . that defendant's acts are illegal. . . . Nothing that could be submitted at such trial on the facts would alter the legal conclusion I have reached."" 103 F. Supp., at 576.
Thus, the District Court's preliminary injunction in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. rested on what amounted to a declaratory judgment that the orders were constitutionally invalid. That in itself was a pronounced departure from normal practice, although one that this Court found proper in the highly unusual circumstances presented in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co., where time was manifestly of the essence,[*] and there was no contention that the Government had been deprived of an opportunity to present facts that could have *823 altered the resolution of the constitutional question. To the contrary, when ""[p]laintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction before answer or hearing, [d]efendant opposed the motion, filing uncontroverted affidavits of Government officials describing the facts underlying the President's order."" 343 U.S., at 678 (Vinson, C. J., dissenting).
Neither of the foregoing justifications for the District Court's unusual decision to reach the merits in Youngstown Sheet & Tube is present here. No emergency remotely comparable to the one in Youngstown Sheet & Tube confronted the Court of Appeals, which granted appellees' motion to enjoin enforcement of the entire Act pending appeal, and withheld judgment until after this Court had ruled in Akron and its companion cases. 737 F.2d, at 290. Appellants conceded in the Court of Appeals that several provisions of the Abortion Act were unconstitutional in the wake of those decisions, but appellants did not concede that the provisions on which the Court of Appeals dispositively ruled were unconstitutional. Nor is there any suggestion that appellants conceded in the Court of Appeals that there were no factual issues that could have a bearing on the constitutionality of these provisions. Consequently, even if a preliminary injunction should have issued, the proper course would have been to remand for final determination of the merits.
Indeed, since Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. was decided this Court has expressly reaffirmed that ""a state statute should not be declared unconstitutional by a district court if a preliminary injunction is granted a plaintiff to protect his interests during the ensuing litigation."" Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 43 (1975). See Mayo v. Lakeland Highlands Canning Co., 309 U.S. 310 (1940). If it is improper for a district court to enter such a declaratory judgment when it grants a preliminary injunction, then a fortiori it is improper for a court of appeals to do so when the district court has only appraised the likelihood of success on the merits. What happened here is even more extreme: the Court of Appeals, reviewing *824 the denial of a preliminary injunction, held in the first instance that nothing that could be submitted at a trial on the merits would alter its conclusion that ""most of the provisions attacked by appellants are unconstitutional as a matter of law."" 737 F.2d, at 287. Nothing in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. remotely suggests that it was proper for the Court of Appeals to take this extraordinary step. ""Camenisch makes clear that a determination of a party's entitlement to a preliminary injunction is a separate issue from the determination of the merits of the party's underlying legal claim, and that a reviewing court should not confuse the two."" Stotts, 467 U. S., at 603 (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting).
The Court strays even further afield when it invokes Smith v. Vulcan Iron Works in defense of the Court of Appeals' decision to reach and resolve the merits despite the fact that the District Court had not done so and without giving the parties ""the benefit . . . of a full opportunity to present their cases."" Camenisch, 451 U. S., at 396. The trial court in Smith, ""upon a bill in equity for the infringement of a patent for an invention . . . entered an interlocutory decree, adjudging that the patent was valid and had been infringed, granting an injunction, and referring the case to a master to take an account of profits and damages."" 165 U.S., at 518 (emphasis added). The defendant challenged the trial court's alleged ""error in holding that the patent was valid, and that it had been infringed."" Ibid. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree, rejecting the plaintiff's contention that it could rule only on ""whether an injunction should be awarded."" Ibid. This Court held that under the plain language of the statute conferring jurisdiction on the Circuit Court of Appeals, an appeal was authorized ""from the whole of such interlocutory order or decree, and not from that part of it only which grants or continues an injunction,"" and consequently the statute conferred ""authority to consider and decide the case upon its merits."" Id., at 525. The trial court, of course, had already done precisely that, deciding the issue *825 of liability after the parties had joined issue on the merits, while referring the matter of damages to a master. Reliance on Smith in this case is therefore misplaced, for, to repeat, the District Court did not decide  and could not properly have decided  the merits of appellees' constitutional claims when it refused to grant a preliminary injunction.
The Court also seeks comfort in an analogy to the rule that a federal court need not abstain, pending state-court review, from reviewing a constitutional challenge to the validity of a state statute that is not fairly subject to an interpretation that will avoid the constitutional question. Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241, 251, and n. 14 (1967). When a federal district court declines to abstain, however, it does not in so doing decide the merits of the constitutional question even if the parties have not had a full opportunity to air them. The court simply proceeds to decide the case in accordance with the normal procedural requirements that safeguard the parties' rights to be heard. A refusal to abstain therefore infringes neither the principle that final judgment should follow a full opportunity to be heard on the factual and legal merits of the case, nor the principle that ""parties shall come to issue in the trial forum vested with authority to determine questions of fact."" Hormel, 312 U. S., at 556. The same cannot be said of what the Court of Appeals did here.
Whatever the exceptions which would justify a district court in finally resolving an issue on the merits at the preliminary injunction stage, no such exception was applicable here. Nor is this a case in which the court of appeals was justified in resolving an issue not passed on in the district court because proper resolution was beyond any doubt or grave injustice might result from failure to do so. See Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U. S., at 121. The Court of Appeals not only decided to stand in the shoes of the District Court by ruling on an issue not passed upon below  it ruled on an issue on which, absent extraordinary circumstances, the District Court could not have ruled without "" `clear and unambiguous *826 notice' "" that would "" `afford the parties a full opportunity to present their respective cases.' "" Camenisch, supra, at 395. The Court attempts to veil the impropriety of its decision to affirm on the merits despite the procedural posture of this case by implying that the challenged provisions are patently unconstitutional. But this claim too is unsupported in this Court's decisions concerning state regulation of abortion.
The discretionary exception the Court fashions today will also prove vexatious to administer. Parties now face the risk that a final ruling on the merits will be entered against them by a court of appeals when an appeal is taken from the grant or denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction, although the district court made only an initial assessment of the likelihood that the moving party would succeed on the merits. It is predictable that parties will respond by attempting to turn preliminary injunction proceedings into contests over summary judgment or full-scale trials on the merits. That tendency will make the preliminary injunction less useful in serving its intended function of preserving the status quo pending final judgment on the merits, while making litigation more expensive, less reliable, and less fair. If this case did not involve state regulation of abortion, it may be doubted that the Court would entertain, let alone adopt, such a departure from its precedents.

II
In this Court, appellants argue that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be vacated and the District Court's denial of a preliminary injunction sustained. Appellants have stated that they ""intend to present to the District Court a complete factual record which . . . could affect the disposition of this case,"" and have indicated some of the specific factual propositions they would seek to establish. Brief for Appellants 44-48. At oral argument, counsel for appellants reiterated that, with the exception of the second-physician requirement, ""there are additional justifications by way of *827 facts that we can offer"" as to each of the challenged provisions. Tr. of Oral Arg. 13. These assertions alone would justify vacating the judgment of the Court of Appeals insofar as that court did more than direct the entry of a preliminary injunction. In Singleton v. Wulff, supra, at 120, for example, this Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision to reach the merits of that case, even though this Court had ""no idea what evidence, if any, petitioner would, or could, offer in defense of this statute,"" because it was clear that ""petitioner has had no opportunity to proffer such evidence."" I would apply that reasoning here even if I were not persuaded that as to several of the challenged provisions additional factual development  for example, facts concerning the costs associated with the reporting and informed consent provisions, and the extent of the problems Pennsylvania was seeking to correct  could affect the decision on the merits. Appellants should not have to prove that they are entitled to an opportunity to be heard.
Since it rendered ""what amounts to a final declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of the statute,"" ante, at 806 (WHITE, J., dissenting), the Court of Appeals necessarily believed that in light of Akron and its companion cases appellees had established a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits to warrant issuance of a preliminary injunction. Pennsylvania contends that this ruling is erroneous even under the supervening decisions of this Court. In the alternative, Pennsylvania suggests that the facial constitutionality of the challenged provisions of its Abortion Act may be sustained on this record.
I agree with much of what JUSTICE WHITE has written in Part II of his dissenting opinion, and the arguments he has framed might well suffice to show that the provisions at issue are facially constitutional. Nonetheless, I believe the proper course is to decide this case as the Court of Appeals should have decided it, lest appellees suffer the very prejudice the Court sees fit to inflict on appellants. For me, then, the *828 question is not one of ""success"" but of the ""likelihood of success."" In addition, because Pennsylvania has not asked the Court to reconsider or overrule Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), I do not address that question.
I do, however, remain of the views expressed in my dissent in Akron, 462 U. S., at 459-466. The State has compelling interests in ensuring maternal health and in protecting potential human life, and these interests exist ""throughout pregnancy."" Id., at 461 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). Under this Court's fundamental-rights jurisprudence, judicial scrutiny of state regulation of abortion should be limited to whether the state law bears a rational relationship to legitimate purposes such as the advancement of these compelling interests, with heightened scrutiny reserved for instances in which the State has imposed an ""undue burden"" on the abortion decision. Id., at 461-463 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). An undue burden will generally be found ""in situations involving absolute obstacles or severe limitations on the abortion decision,"" not wherever a state regulation ""may `inhibit' abortions to some degree."" Id., at 464 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). And if a state law does interfere with the abortion decision to an extent that is unduly burdensome, so that it becomes ""necessary to apply an exacting standard of review,"" id., at 467 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting), the possibility remains that the statute will withstand the stricter scrutiny. See id., at 473-474 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting); Ashcroft, 462 U. S., at 505 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).
These principles for evaluating state regulation of abortion were not newly minted in my dissenting opinion in Akron. Apart from Roe's outmoded trimester framework, the ""unduly burdensome"" standard had been articulated and applied with fair consistency by this Court in cases such as Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 314 (1980), Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 473 (1977), Beal v. Doe, 432 U.S. 438, 446 (1977), and Bellotti v. Baird, 428 U.S. 132, 147 (1976). In Akron and *829 Ashcroft the Court, in my view, distorted and misapplied this standard, see Akron, 462 U. S., at 452-453 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting), but made no clean break with precedent and indeed ""follow[ed] this approach"" in assessing some of the regulations before it in those cases. Id., at 463 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting).
The Court today goes well beyond mere distortion of the ""unduly burdensome"" standard. By holding that each of the challenged provisions is facially unconstitutional as a matter of law, and that no conceivable facts appellants might offer could alter this result, the Court appears to adopt as its new test a per se rule under which any regulation touching on abortion must be invalidated if it poses ""an unacceptable danger of deterring the exercise of that right."" Ante, at 767. Under this prophylactic test, it seems that the mere possibility that some women will be less likely to choose to have an abortion by virtue of the presence of a particular state regulation suffices to invalidate it. Simultaneously, the Court strains to discover ""the anti-abortion character of the statute,"" ante, at 764, and, as JUSTICE WHITE points out, invents an unprecedented canon of construction under which ""in cases involving abortion, a permissible reading of a statute is to be avoided at all costs."" Ante, at 812 (dissenting). I shall not belabor the dangerous extravagance of this dual approach, because I hope it represents merely a temporary aberration rather than a portent of lasting change in settled principles of constitutional law. Suffice it to say that I dispute not only the wisdom but also the legitimacy of the Court's attempt to discredit and pre-empt state abortion regulation regardless of the interests it serves and the impact it has.
Under the ""unduly burdensome"" test, the District Judge's conclusion that appellees were not entitled to a preliminary injunction was clearly correct. Indeed, the District Judge applied essentially that test, after suggesting that no ""meaningful distinction can be made between the plaintiffs' `legally *830 significant burden' and defendants' `undue burden.' "" 552 F. Supp., at 796. I begin, as does the Court, with the Act's informed consent provisions.
The Court condemns some specific features of the informed consent provisions of § 3205, and issues a blanket condemnation of the provisions in their entirety as irrelevant or distressing in some cases and as intruding on the relationship between the woman and her physician. JUSTICE WHITE convincingly argues that none of the Court's general criticisms is appropriate, since the information is clearly relevant in many cases and is calculated to inform rather than intimidate, and since all informed consent requirements must, from the very rationale for their existence, intrude to some extent on the physician's discretion to be the sole judge of what his or her patient needs to know. The ""parade of horribles"" the Court invalidated in Akron, supra, at 445, is missing here. For example, § 3205(a)(iii) requires that the woman be informed, ""when medically accurate,"" of the risks associated with a particular abortion procedure, and § 3205(a)(v) requires the physician to inform the woman of ""[t]he medical risks associated with carrying her child to term."" This is the kind of balanced information I would have thought all could agree is relevant to a woman's informed consent.
I do not dismiss the possibility that requiring the physician or counselor to read aloud the State's printed materials if the woman wishes access to them but cannot read raises First Amendment concerns. Even the requirement that women who can read be informed of the availability of those materials, and furnished with them on request, may create some possibility that the physician or counselor is being required to ""communicate [the State's] ideology."" Akron, supra, at 472, n. 16 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting); see Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705 (1977). Since the Court of Appeals did not reach appellees' First Amendment claim, and since appellees do not raise it here, I need not decide whether this potential problem would be sufficiently serious to warrant issuance of a *831 preliminary injunction as to those portions of § 3205 that incorporate the printed information provisions of § 3208. I note, however, that this is one of many points on which fuller factual development, including the actual contents of the printed materials, could affect resolution of the merits.
The Court singles out for specific criticism the required description, in the printed materials, of fetal characteristics at 2-week intervals. These materials, of course, will be shown to the woman only if she chooses to inspect them. If the materials were sufficiently inflammatory and inaccurate the fact that the woman must ask to see them would not necessarily preclude finding an undue burden, but there is no indication that this is true of the description of fetal characteristics the statute contemplates. Accordingly, I think it unlikely that appellees could succeed in making the threshold showing of an undue burden on this point, and the information is certainly rationally related to the State's interests in ensuring informed consent and in protecting potential human life. Similarly, I see little chance that appellees can establish that the abortion decision is unduly burdened by § 3205's requirements that the woman be informed of the availability of medical assistance benefits and of the father's legal responsibility. Here again, the information is indisputably relevant in many cases and would not appear to place a severe limitation on the abortion decision.
The Court's rationale for striking down the reporting requirements of § 3214, as JUSTICE WHITE shows, rests on an unsupported finding of fact by this Court to the effect that ""[i]dentification is the obvious purpose of these extreme reporting requirements."" Ante, at 767 (opinion of the Court). The Court's ""finding,"" which is contrary to the preliminary finding of the District Judge that the statute's confidentiality requirements protected against any invasion of privacy that could burden the abortion decision, see 552 F. Supp., at 804, is simply another consequence of the Court's determination to prevent the parties from developing the facts. I do not *832 know whether JUSTICE WHITE is correct in stating that ""the provisions pose little or no threat to the woman's privacy,"" ante, at 807 (dissenting), and I would leave that determination for the District Court, which can hear evidence on this point before making its findings. I do not, however, see a substantial threat of identification on the face of the statute, which does not require disclosure of the woman's identity to anyone, and which provides that reports shall be disclosed to the public only in ""a form which will not lead to the disclosure of the identity of any person filing a report."" § 3214(e)(2). I therefore conclude that the District Judge correctly ruled that appellees are unlikely to succeed in establishing an undue burden on the abortion decision stemming from the possibility of identification.
I fully agree with JUSTICE WHITE that the Court has misconstrued the intended meaning of § 3210(b)'s requirement that physicians employ the abortion method that is most likely to save the fetus unless, in the physician's good-faith judgment, that method ""would present a significantly greater risk to the life or health of the pregnant woman."" Since § 3210(b) can fairly be read to require ""only that the risk be a real and identifiable one,"" ante, at 807 (WHITE, J., dissenting), there is little possibility that a woman's abortion decision will be unduly burdened by risks falling below that threshold. Accordingly, § 3210(b) should not be preliminarily enjoined, and I express no opinion as to the point at which a ""trade-off"" between the health of the woman and the survival of the fetus would rise to the level of an undue burden.
Since appellants and appellees agree that no further factfinding is needed concerning appellees' challenge to § 3210(c)'s second-physician requirement, I am willing to assume that the merits of that challenge are properly before us. I have nothing to add to JUSTICE WHITE'S demonstration that this provision is constitutional under Ashcroft because the Act effectively provides for an exception making this requirement inapplicable in emergency situations. I likewise agree *833 with JUSTICE WHITE that the preliminary injunction entered against enforcement of the Act's parental notice and consent provisions should be vacated, since, as in Ashcroft, there is no reason here to believe that the State will not provide for the expedited procedures called for by its statute. See Ashcroft, 462 U. S., at 491, n. 16 (opinion of POWELL, J.). I add only that the Court's explanation for its refusal to follow Ashcroft  that the new rules ""should be considered by the District Court in the first instance,"" ante, at 758, n. 9  does not square with its insistence on resolving the rest of this case without giving the District Court an opportunity to do so.
In my view, today's decision makes bad constitutional law and bad procedural law. The "" `undesired and uncomfortable straitjacket' "" in this case, ante, at 762, is not the one the Court purports to discover in Pennsylvania's statute; it is the one the Court has tailored for the 50 States. I respectfully dissent.
"
26558,Justice Blackmun,majority,False,Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,,1986,2.0,"This is an appeal from a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reviewing the District Court's rulings upon a motion for a preliminary injunction. The Court of Appeals held unconstitutional several provisions of Pennsylvania's current Abortion Control Act, 1982 Pa. Laws, Act No. 138, now codified as 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 3201 et seq. (1982).[1] Among the provisions ruled invalid by the Court of Appeals were portions of § 3205, relating to ""informed consent""; § 3208, concerning ""printed information""; §§ 3210(b) and (c), having to do with postviability abortions; and § 3211(a) and §§ 3214(a) and (h), regarding reporting requirements.[2]


*751 I
The Abortion Control Act was approved by the Governor of the Commonwealth on June 11, 1982. By its own terms, however, see § 7 of the Act, it was to become effective only 180 days thereafter, that is, on the following December 8. It had been offered as an amendment to a pending bill to regulate paramilitary training.
The 1982 Act was not the Commonwealth's first attempt, after this Court's 1973 decisions in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, and Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, to impose abortion restraints. The State's first post-1973 Abortion Control Act, 1974 Pa. Laws, Act No. 209, was passed in 1974 over the Governor's veto. After extensive litigation, various provisions of the 1974 statute were ruled unconstitutional, including those relating to spousal or parental consent, to the choice of procedure for a postviability abortion, and to the proscription of abortion advertisements. See Planned Parenthood Assn. v. Fitzpatrick, 401 F. Supp. 554 (ED Pa. 1975), summarily aff'd in part sub nom. Franklin v. Fitzgerald, 428 U.S. 901 (1976), and summarily vacated in part and remanded sub nom. Beal v. Franklin, 428 U.S. 901 (1976), modified on remand (No. 74-2440) (ED Pa. 1977), aff'd sub nom. Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379 (1979). See also Doe v. Zimmerman, 405 F. Supp. 534 (MD Pa. 1975).
In 1978, the Pennsylvania Legislature attempted to restrict access to abortion by limiting medical-assistance funding for the procedure. 2 1978 Pa. Laws, Act No. 16A (pp. 1506-1507) and 1 1978 Pa. Laws, Act No. 148. This effort, too, was successfully challenged in federal court, Roe v. Casey, 464 F. Supp. 487 (ED Pa. 1978), and that judgment was affirmed by the Third Circuit. 623 F.2d 829 (1980).
In 1981, abortion legislation was proposed in the Pennsylvania House as an amendment to a pending Senate bill to outlaw *752 ""tough-guy competitions.""[3] The suggested amendment, aimed at limiting abortions, was patterned after a model statute developed by a Chicago-based, nonprofit anti-abortion organization. See Note, Toward Constitutional Abortion Control Legislation: The Pennsylvania Approach, 87 Dick. L. Rev. 373, 382, n. 84 (1983). The bill underwent further change in the legislative process but, when passed, was vetoed by the Governor. See 737 F.2d 283, 288-289 (CA3 1984). Finally, the 1982 Act was formulated, enacted, and approved.
After the passage of the Act, but before its effective date, the present litigation was instituted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The plaintiffs, who are the appellees here, were the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Pennsylvania Section; certain physicians licensed in Pennsylvania; clergymen; an individual who purchases from a Pennsylvania insurer health-care and disability insurance extending to abortions; and Pennsylvania abortion counselors and providers. Alleging that the Act violated the United States Constitution, the plaintiffs, pursuant to 42 U.S. C. § 1983, sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The defendants named in the complaint were the Governor of the Commonwealth, other Commonwealth officials, and the District Attorney for Montgomery County, Pa.
The plaintiffs promptly filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. Forty-one affidavits accompanied the motion. The defendants, on their part, submitted what the Court of Appeals described as ""an equally comprehensive opposing memorandum."" 737 F.2d, at 289. The District Court then ordered the parties to submit a ""stipulation of uncontested facts,"" as authorized by local rule. The parties produced a stipulation ""solely for purposes of a determination on plaintiffs' *753 motion for preliminary injunction,"" and ""without prejudice to any party's right to controvert any facts or to prove any additional facts at any later proceeding in this action."" App. 9a-10a.
Relying substantially on the opinions of the respective Courts of Appeals in Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc. v. City of Akron, 651 F.2d 1198 (CA6 1981), later aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 462 U.S. 416 (1983), and in Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City v. Ashcroft, 655 F.2d 848 (CA8 1981), later aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 462 U.S. 476 (1983), the District Court concluded that, with one exception, see n. 1, supra, the plaintiffs had failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits and thus were not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief. 552 F. Supp. 791 (1982).
Appellees appealed from the denial of the preliminary injunction, and appellants cross-appealed with respect to the single statutory provision as to which the District Court had allowed relief. The Third Circuit then granted appellees' motion to enjoin enforcement of the entire Act pending appeal. After expedited briefing and argument, the court withheld judgment pending the anticipated decisions by this Court in Akron, supra, Ashcroft, supra, and Simopoulos v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 1059, 277 S.E.2d 194 (1981), all of which had been accepted for review here, had been argued, and were under submission. Those three cases were decided by this Court on June 15, 1983. See Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416; Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Missouri, Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U.S. 476; Simopoulos v. Virginia, 462 U.S. 506. After reargument in light of those decisions, the Court of Appeals, with one judge concurring in part and dissenting in part, ruled that various provisions of the Act were unconstitutional. 737 F.2d 283 (1984). Appellants' petition for rehearing en banc was denied, with four judges voting to grant the petition. Id., at 316, 317. When a jurisdictional statement *754 was filed here, we postponed further consideration of the question of our jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits. 471 U.S. 1014 (1985).

II
We are confronted initially with the question whether we have appellate jurisdiction in this case. Appellants purport to have taken their appeal to this Court pursuant to 28 U.S. C. § 1254(2).[4] It seems clear, and the parties appear to agree, see Brief for Appellants 21, that the judgment of the Court of Appeals was not a final judgment in the ordinary meaning of that term. The court did not hold the entire Act unconstitutional, but ruled, instead, that some provisions were invalid under Akron, Ashcroft, and Simopoulos, and that the validity of other provisions might depend on evidence adduced at the trial, see 737 F.2d, at 299-300, or on procedural rules to be promulgated by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, see id., at 296-297. It remanded these features of the case to the District Court. Id., at 304.
Slaker v. O'Connor, 278 U.S. 188, 189-190 (1929), and McLish v. Roff, 141 U.S. 661, 665-666 (1891), surely suggest that, under these circumstances, we do not have appellate jurisdiction.[5] See also South Carolina Electric & Gas Co. v. Flemming, 351 U.S. 901 (1956). Although the authority of Slaker and South Carolina Electric has been questioned, the Court to date has found it unnecessary to put the issue to rest. See Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U.S. 922, 927 (1975); Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 43-44, n. 1 (1986). In some cases raising this issue of the *755 scope of appellate jurisdiction, the Court has found any finality requirement to have been satisfied in light of the facts. See, e. g., New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297, 302 (1976); Chicago v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 357 U.S. 77, 82-83 (1958). In other cases, the Court has avoided the issue by utilizing 28 U.S. C. § 2103 and granting certiorari. See, e. g., Doran, 422 U. S., at 927; El Paso v. Simmons, 379 U.S. 497, 503 (1965); see also Escambia County v. McMillan, 466 U.S. 48, 50, n. 4 (1984).
We have concluded that it is time that this undecided issue be resolved. We therefore hold, on the reasoning of McLish v. Roff, 141 U. S., at 665-668, that in a situation such as this one, where the judgment is not final, and where the case is remanded for further development of the facts, we have no appellate jurisdiction under § 1254(2).
We nevertheless treat appellants' jurisdictional statement as a petition for certiorari, grant the writ, and move on to the merits.[6]

III
Appellants assert that the Court of Appeals erred in holding portions of the Act unconstitutional since the scope of its review of the District Court's denial of a preliminary injunction as to those sections should have been limited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion in finding the presence or absence of irreparable harm and a probability that the plaintiffs would succeed on the merits. Such limited review normally is appropriate, see Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U. S., at 931-932; Brown v. Chote, 411 U.S. 452, 456-457 (1973), inasmuch as the primary purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the relative positions of the parties. See University of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). Further, the necessity for an expeditious resolution often means that the injunction is issued on a procedure *756 less stringent than that which prevails at the subsequent trial on the merits of the application for injunctive relief. See United States Steel Corp. v. Fraternal Assn. of Steelhaulers, 431 F.2d 1046, 1048 (CA3 1970); see also Mayo v. Lakeland Highlands Canning Co., 309 U.S. 310, 316 (1940).
This approach, however, is not inflexible. The Court on more than one occasion in this area has approved proceedings deviating from the stated norm. In Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), the District Court had issued a preliminary injunction restraining the Secretary of Commerce from seizing the Nation's steel mills. The Court of Appeals stayed the injunction. This Court found that the case was ripe for review, despite the early stage of the litigation, and went on to address the merits. Id., at 585. And in Smith v. Vulcan Iron Works, 165 U.S. 518 (1897), the District Court issued injunctions in two patent cases and referred them to a Master for accounting. The Court of Appeals reversed. This Court ruled that the Court of Appeals had acted properly in deciding the merits since review of interlocutory appeals was designed not only to permit the defendant to obtain immediate relief but also in certain cases to save the parties the expense of further litigation. Id., at 525.
The Third Circuit's decision to address the constitutionality of the Pennsylvania Act finds further support in this Court's decisions that when the unconstitutionality of the particular state action under challenge is clear, a federal court need not abstain from addressing the constitutional issue pending state-court review. See, e. g., Bailey v. Patterson, 369 U.S. 31, 33 (1962); Turner v. City of Memphis, 369 U.S. 350, 353 (1962); Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241, 251, n. 14 (1967). See also Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 121 (1976). See generally Spann, Simple Justice, 73 Geo. L. J. 1041, 1055, n. 77 (1985).[7]
*757 Thus, as these cases indicate, if a district court's ruling rests solely on a premise as to the applicable rule of law, and the facts are established or of no controlling relevance, that ruling may be reviewed even though the appeal is from the entry of a preliminary injunction.[8] The Court of Appeals in this case properly recognized and applied these principles when it observed:
""Thus, although this appeal arises from a ruling on a request for a preliminary injunction, we have before us an unusually complete factual and legal presentation from which to address the important constitutional issues at stake. The customary discretion accorded to a District Court's ruling on a preliminary injunction yields to our plenary scope of review as to the applicable law."" 737 F.2d, at 290.
That a court of appeals ordinarily will limit its review in a case of this kind to abuse of discretion is a rule of orderly judicial administration, not a limit on judicial power. With a full record before it on the issues now before us, and with the intervening decisions in Akron, Ashcroft, and Simopoulos at hand, the Court of Appeals was justified in proceeding to plenary review of those issues.

This case, as it comes to us, concerns the constitutionality of six provisions of the Pennsylvania Act that the Court of Appeals struck down as facially invalid: § 3205 (""informed consent""); § 3208 (""printed information""); §§ 3214(a) and (h) (reporting requirements); § 3211(a) (determination of viability); § 3210(b) (degree of care required in postviability abortions); and § 3210(c) (second-physician requirement). We have no reason to address the validity of the other sections of the Act challenged in the District Court.[9]


*759 A
Less than three years ago, this Court, in Akron, Ashcroft, and Simopoulos, reviewed challenges to state and municipal legislation regulating the performance of abortions. In Akron, the Court specifically reaffirmed Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973). See 462 U.S., at 420, 426-431. Again today, we reaffirm the general principles laid down in Roe and in Akron.
In the years since this Court's decision in Roe, States and municipalities have adopted a number of measures seemingly designed to prevent a woman, with the advice of her physician, from exercising her freedom of choice. Akron is but one example. But the constitutional principles that led this Court to its decisions in 1973 still provide the compelling reason for recognizing the constitutional dimensions of a woman's right to decide whether to end her pregnancy. ""[I]t should go without saying that the vitality of these constitutional principles cannot be allowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them."" Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 300 (1955). The States are not free, under the guise of protecting maternal health or potential life, to intimidate women into continuing pregnancies. Appellants claim that the statutory provisions before us today further legitimate compelling interests of the Commonwealth. Close analysis of those provisions, however, shows that they wholly subordinate constitutional privacy interests and concerns with maternal health in an effort to deter a woman from making a decision that, with her physician, is hers to make.

B
We turn to the challenged statutes:
1. Section 3205 (""informed consent"") and § 3208 (""printed information""). Section 3205(a) requires that the woman give her ""voluntary and informed consent"" to an abortion. Failure to observe the provisions of § 3205 subjects the physician to suspension or revocation of his license, and subjects any *760 other person obligated to provide information relating to informed consent to criminal penalties. § 3205(c). A requirement that the woman give what is truly a voluntary and informed consent, as a general proposition, is, of course, proper and is surely not unconstitutional. See Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 67 (1976). But the State may not require the delivery of information designed ""to influence the woman's informed choice between abortion or childbirth."" Akron, 462 U. S., at 443-444.
Appellants refer to the Akron ordinance, Brief for Appellants 67, as did this Court in Akron itself, 462 U.S., at 445, as ""a litany of information"" and as "" `a parade of horribles' "" of dubious validity plainly designed to influence the woman's choice. They would distinguish the Akron situation, however, from the Pennsylvania one. Appellants assert that statutes ""describing the general subject matter relevant to informed consent,"" ibid., and stating ""in general terms the information to be disclosed,"" id., at 447, are permissible, and they further assert that the Pennsylvania statutes do no more than that.
We do not agree. We conclude that, like Akron's ordinance, §§ 3205 and 3208 fail the Akron measurement. The two sections prescribe in detail the method for securing ""informed consent."" Seven explicit kinds of information must be delivered to the woman at least 24 hours before her consent is given, and five of these must be presented by the woman's physician. The five are: (a) the name of the physician who will perform the abortion, (b) the ""fact that there may be detrimental physical and psychological effects which are not accurately foreseeable,"" (c) the ""particular medical risks associated with the particular abortion procedure to be employed,"" (d) the probable gestational age, and (e) the ""medical risks associated with carrying her child to term."" The remaining two categories are (f) the ""fact that medical assistance benefits may be available for prenatal care, childbirth *761 and neonatal care,"" and (g) the ""fact that the father is liable to assist"" in the child's support, ""even in instances where the father has offered to pay for the abortion."" §§ 3205(a)(1) and (2). The woman also must be informed that materials printed and supplied by the Commonwealth that describe the fetus and that list agencies offering alternatives to abortion are available for her review. If she chooses to review the materials but is unable to read, the materials ""shall be read to her,"" and any answer she seeks must be ""provided her in her own language."" § 3205(a)(2)(iii). She must certify in writing, prior to the abortion, that all this has been done. § 3205(a)(3). The printed materials ""shall include the following statement"":
"" `There are many public and private agencies willing and able to help you to carry your child to term, and to assist you and your child after your child is born, whether you choose to keep your child or place her or him for adoption. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania strongly urges you to contact them before making a final decision about abortion. The law requires that your physician or his agent give you the opportunity to call agencies like these before you undergo an abortion.' "" § 3208(a)(1).
The materials must describe the ""probable anatomical and physiological characteristics of the unborn child at two-week gestational increments from fertilization to full term, including any relevant information on the possibility of the unborn child's survival."" § 3208(a)(2).
In Akron, this Court noted: ""The validity of an informed consent requirement thus rests on the State's interest in protecting the health of the pregnant woman."" 462 U.S., at 443. The Court went on to state:
""This does not mean, however, that a State has unreviewable authority to decide what information a woman must be given before she chooses to have an *762 abortion. It remains primarily the responsibility of the physician to ensure that appropriate information is conveyed to his patient, depending on her particular circumstances. Danforth's recognition of the State's interest in ensuring that this information be given will not justify abortion regulations designed to influence the woman's informed choice between abortion or childbirth."" Id., at 443-444.
The informational requirements in the Akron ordinance were invalid for two ""equally decisive"" reasons. Id., at 445. The first was that ""much of the information required is designed not to inform the woman's consent but rather to persuade her to withhold it altogether."" Id., at 444. The second was that a rigid requirement that a specific body of information be given in all cases, irrespective of the particular needs of the patient, intrudes upon the discretion of the pregnant woman's physician and thereby imposes the ""undesired and uncomfortable straitjacket"" with which the Court in Danforth, 428 U. S., at 67, n. 8, was concerned.
These two reasons apply with equal and controlling force to the specific and intrusive informational prescriptions of the Pennsylvania statutes. The printed materials required by §§ 3205 and 3208 seem to us to be nothing less than an outright attempt to wedge the Commonwealth's message discouraging abortion into the privacy of the informed-consent dialogue between the woman and her physician. The mandated description of fetal characteristics at 2-week intervals, no matter how objective, is plainly overinclusive. This is not medical information that is always relevant to the woman's decision, and it may serve only to confuse and punish her and to heighten her anxiety, contrary to accepted medical practice.[10] Even the listing of agencies in the printed Pennsylvania *763 form presents serious problems; it contains names of agencies that well may be out of step with the needs of the particular woman and thus places the physician in an awkward position and infringes upon his or her professional responsibilities. Forcing the physician or counselor to present the materials and the list to the woman makes him or her in effect an agent of the State in treating the woman and places his or her imprimatur upon both the materials and the list. See Women's Medical Center of Providence, Inc. v. Roberts, 530 F. Supp. 1136, 1154 (RI 1982). All this is, or comes close to being, state medicine imposed upon the woman, not the professional medical guidance she seeks, and it officially structures  as it obviously was intended to do  the dialogue between the woman and her physician.
The requirements of §§ 3205(a)(2)(i) and (ii) that the woman be advised that medical assistance benefits may be available, and that the father is responsible for financial assistance in the support of the child similarly are poorly disguised elements of discouragement for the abortion decision. Much of this would be nonmedical information beyond the physician's area of expertise and, for many patients, would be irrelevant and inappropriate. For a patient with a life-threatening pregnancy, the ""information"" in its very rendition may be cruel as well as destructive of the physician-patient relationship. As any experienced social worker or other counselor knows, theoretical financial responsibility often does not equate with fulfillment. And a victim of rape should not have to hear gratuitous advice that an unidentified perpetrator is liable for support if she continues the pregnancy to term. Under the guise of informed consent, the Act requires the dissemination of information that is not relevant to such consent, and, thus, it advances no legitimate state interest.
*764 The requirements of §§ 3205(a)(1)(ii) and (iii) that the woman be informed by the physician of ""detrimental physical and psychological effects"" and of all ""particular medical risks"" compound the problem of medical attendance, increase the patient's anxiety, and intrude upon the physician's exercise of proper professional judgment. This type of compelled information is the antithesis of informed consent. That the Commonwealth does not, and surely would not, compel similar disclosure of every possible peril of necessary surgery or of simple vaccination, reveals the anti-abortion character of the statute and its real purpose. Pennsylvania, like Akron, ""has gone far beyond merely describing the general subject matter relevant to informed consent."" Akron, 462 U. S., at 445. In addition, the Commonwealth would require the physician to recite its litany ""regardless of whether in his judgment the information is relevant to [the patient's] personal decision."" Ibid. These statutory defects cannot be saved by any facts that might be forthcoming at a subsequent hearing. Section 3205's informational requirements therefore are facially unconstitutional.[11]
Appellants assert, however, that even if this be so, the remedy is to allow the remainder of § 3205 to be severed and become effective. We rule otherwise. The radical dissection necessary for this would leave § 3205 with little resemblance to that intended by the Pennsylvania Legislature. We rejected a similar suggestion as to the ordinance in *765 Akron, 462 U. S, at 445, n. 37, despite the presence there of a broad severability clause. We reach the same conclusion here, where no such clause is present, and reject the plea for severance. See Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 312-313 (1936).
2. Sections 3214(a) and (h) (reporting) and § 3211(a) (determination of viability). Section 3214(a)(8), part of the general reporting section, incorporates § 3211(a). Section 3211(a) requires the physician to report the basis for his determination ""that a child is not viable."" It applies only after the first trimester. The report required by §§ 3214(a) and (h) is detailed and must include, among other things, identification of the performing and referring physicians and of the facility or agency; information as to the woman's political subdivision and State of residence, age, race, marital status, and number of prior pregnancies; the date of her last menstrual period and the probable gestational age; the basis for any judgment that a medical emergency existed; the basis for any determination of nonviability; and the method of payment for the abortion. The report is to be signed by the attending physician. § 3214(b).
Despite the fact that § 3214(e)(2) provides that such reports ""shall not be deemed public records,"" within the meaning of the Commonwealth's ""Right-to-Know Law,"" Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 65, § 66.1 et seq. (Purdon 1959 and Supp. 1985), each report ""shall be made available for public inspection and copying within 15 days of receipt in a form which will not lead to the disclosure of the identity of any person filing a report."" Similarly, the report of complications, required by § 3214(h), ""shall be open to public inspection and copying."" A willful failure to file a report required under § 3214 is ""unprofessional conduct"" and the noncomplying physician's license ""shall be subject to suspension or revocation."" § 3214(i)(1).
The scope of the information required and its availability to the public belie any assertions by the Commonwealth that it is advancing any legitimate interest. In Planned Parenthood *766 of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U. S., at 80, we recognized that recordkeeping and reporting provisions ""that are reasonably directed to the preservation of maternal health and that properly respect a patient's confidentiality and privacy are permissible."" But the reports required under the Act before us today go well beyond the health-related interests that served to justify the Missouri reports under consideration in Danforth. Pennsylvania would require, as Missouri did not, information as to method of payment, as to the woman's personal history, and as to the bases for medical judgments. The Missouri reports were to be used ""only for statistical purposes."" See id., at 87. They were to be maintained in confidence, with the sole exception of public health officers. In Akron, the Court explained its holding in Danforth when it said: ""The decisive factor was that the State met its burden of demonstrating that these regulations furthered important health-related state concerns."" 462 U.S., at 430.
The required Pennsylvania reports, on the other hand, while claimed not to be ""public,"" are available nonetheless to the public for copying. Moreover, there is no limitation on the use to which the Commonwealth or the public copiers may put them. The elements that proved persuasive for the ruling in Danforth are absent here. The decision to terminate a pregnancy is an intensely private one that must be protected in a way that assures anonymity. JUSTICE STEVENS, in his opinion concurring in the judgment in Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622 (1979), aptly observed:
""It is inherent in the right to make the abortion decision that the right may be exercised without public scrutiny and in defiance of the contrary opinion of the sovereign or other third parties."" Id., at 655.
A woman and her physician will necessarily be more reluctant to choose an abortion if there exists a possibility that her decision and her identity will become known publicly. Although the statute does not specifically require the reporting *767 of the woman's name, the amount of information about her and the circumstances under which she had an abortion are so detailed that identification is likely. Identification is the obvious purpose of these extreme reporting requirements.[12] The ""impermissible limits"" that Danforth mentioned and that Missouri approached, see 428 U.S., at 81, have been exceeded here.
We note, as we reach this conclusion, that the Court consistently has refused to allow government to chill the exercise of constitutional rights by requiring disclosure of protected, but sometimes unpopular, activities. See, e. g., Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U.S. 301 (1965) (invalidating Post Office requirement that addressee affirmatively request delivery of ""communist"" materials in order to receive them); Talley v. California, 362 U.S. 60, 64-65 (1960) (striking down municipal ban on unsigned handbills); NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 462-465 (1958) (invalidating compelled disclosure of NAACP membership list). Pennsylvania's reporting requirements raise the specter of public exposure and harassment of women who choose to exercise their personal, intensely private, right, with their physician, to end a pregnancy. Thus, they pose an unacceptable *768 danger of deterring the exercise of that right, and must be invalidated.
3. Section 3210(b) (degree of care for postviability abortions) and § 3210(c) (second-physician requirement when the fetus is possibly viable). Section 3210(b)[13] sets forth two independent requirements for a postviability abortion. First, it demands the exercise of that degree of care ""which such person would be required to exercise in order to preserve the life and health of any unborn child intended to be born and not aborted."" Second, ""the abortion technique employed shall be that which would provide the best opportunity for the unborn child to be aborted alive unless,"" in the physician's good-faith judgment, that technique ""would present a significantly greater medical risk to the life or health of the pregnant woman."" An intentional, knowing, or reckless violation of this standard is a felony of the third degree, and subjects the violator to the possibility of imprisonment for not more than seven years and to a fine of not more than $15,000. See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. §§ 1101(2) and 1103(3) (1982).
The Court of Appeals ruled that § 3210(b) was unconstitutional because it required a ""trade-off"" between the woman's health and fetal survival, and failed to require that maternal *769 health be the physician's paramount consideration. 737 F.2d, at 300, citing Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 397-401 (1979) (where Pennsylvania's 1974 Abortion Control Act was reviewed). In Colautti, this Court recognized the undesirability of any "" `trade-off' between the woman's health and additional percentage points of fetal survival."" Id., at 400.
Appellants do not take any real issue with this proposition. See Brief for Appellants 84-86. They argue instead, as did the District Court, see 552 F. Supp., at 806-807, that the statute's words ""significantly greater medical risk"" for the life or health of the woman do not mean some additional risk (in which case unconstitutionality apparently is conceded) but only a ""meaningfully increased"" risk. That interpretation, said the District Court, renders the statute constitutional. Id., at 807. The Court of Appeals disagreed, pointing out that such a reading is inconsistent with the statutory language and with the legislative intent reflected in that language; that the adverb ""significantly"" modifies the risk imposed on the woman; that the adverb is ""patently not surplusage""; and that the language of the statute ""is not susceptible to a construction that does not require the mother to bear an increased medical risk in order to save her viable fetus."" 737 F.2d, at 300. We agree with the Court of Appeals and therefore find the statute to be facially invalid.[14]
Section 3210(c)[15] requires that a second physician be present during an abortion performed when viability is possible. *770 The second physician is to ""take control of the child and. . . provide immediate medical care for the child, taking all reasonable steps necessary, in his judgment, to preserve the child's life and health."" Violation of this requirement is a felony of the third degree.
In Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Missouri, Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U.S. 476 (1983), the Court, by a 5-4 vote, but not by a controlling single opinion, ruled that a Missouri statute requiring the presence of a second physician during an abortion performed after viability was constitutional. JUSTICE POWELL, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, concluded that the State had a compelling interest in protecting the life of a viable fetus and that the second physician's presence provided assurance that the State's interest was protected more fully than with only one physician in attendance. Id., at 482-486.[16] JUSTICE POWELL recognized that, to pass constitutional muster, the statute must contain an exception for the situation where the health of the mother was endangered by delay in the arrival of the second physician. Recognizing that there was ""no clearly expressed exception"" on the face of the Missouri statute for the emergency situation, JUSTICE POWELL found the exception implicit in the statutory requirement that action be taken to preserve the fetus ""provided it does not pose an increased risk to the life or health of the woman."" Id., at 485, n. 8.
Like the Missouri statute, § 3210(c) of the Pennsylvania statute contains no express exception for an emergency situation. While the Missouri statute, in the view of JUSTICE POWELL, was worded sufficiently to imply an emergency exception, Pennsylvania's statute contains no such comforting or *771 helpful language and evinces no intent to protect a woman whose life may be at risk. Section 3210(a)[17] provides only a defense to criminal liability for a physician who concluded, in good faith, that a fetus was nonviable ""or that the abortion was necessary to preserve maternal life or health."" It does not relate to the second-physician requirement and its words are not words of emergency.
It is clear that the Pennsylvania Legislature knows how to provide a medical-emergency exception when it chooses to do so. It defined ""[m]edical emergency"" in general terms in § 3203, and it specifically provided a medical-emergency exception with respect to informational requirements, § 3205(b); for parental consent, § 3206; for post-first-trimester hospitalization, § 3209; and for a public official's issuance of an order for an abortion without the express voluntary consent of the woman, § 3215(f). We necessarily conclude that the legislature's failure to provide a medical-emergency exception in § 3210(c) was intentional. All the factors are here for chilling the performance of a late abortion, which, more than one performed at an earlier date, perhaps tends to be under emergency conditions.

V
Constitutional rights do not always have easily ascertainable boundaries, and controversy over the meaning of our Nation's most majestic guarantees frequently has been turbulent. As judges, however, we are sworn to uphold the law even when its content gives rise to bitter dispute. See Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1 (1958). We recognized at the very *772A beginning of our opinion in Roe, 410 U. S., at 116, that abortion raises moral and spiritual questions over which honorable persons can disagree sincerely and profoundly. But those disagreements did not then and do not now relieve us of our duty to apply the Constitution faithfully.
Our cases long have recognized that the Constitution embodies a promise that a certain private sphere of individual liberty will be kept largely beyond the reach of government. See, e. g., Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U.S. 678 (1977); Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494 (1977); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972); Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965); Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923). See also Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 598-600 (1977). That promise extends to women as well as to men. Few decisions are more personal and intimate, more properly private, or more basic to individual dignity and autonomy, than a woman's decision  with the guidance of her physician and within the limits specified in Roe  whether to end her pregnancy. A woman's right to make that choice freely is fundamental. Any other result, in our view, would protect inadequately a central part of the sphere of liberty that our law guarantees equally to all.
The Court of Appeals correctly invalidated the specified provisions of Pennsylvania's 1982 Abortion Control Act. Its judgment is affirmed.
It is so ordered."
17826,Justice O'Connor,concurring,False,Bowen v. Kendrick,,1988,1.0,"This litigation raises somewhat unusual questions involving a facially valid statute that appears to have been administered in a way that led to violations of the Establishment Clause. I agree with the Court's resolution of those questions, and I join its opinion. I write separately, however, to explain why I do not believe that the Court's approach reflects any tolerance for the kind of improper administration that seems to have occurred in the Government program at issue here.
The dissent says, and I fully agree, that ""[p]ublic funds may not be used to endorse the religious message."" Post, at *623 642. As the Court notes, ""there is no dispute that the record contains evidence of specific incidents of impermissible behavior by AFLA grantees."" Ante, at 620. Because the District Court employed an analytical framework that did not require a detailed discussion of the voluminous record, the extent of this impermissible behavior and the degree to which it is attributable to poor administration by the Executive Branch is somewhat less clear. In this circumstance, two points deserve to be emphasized. First, any use of public funds to promote religious doctrines violates the Establishment Clause. Second, extensive violations  if they can be proved in this case  will be highly relevant in shaping an appropriate remedy that ends such abuses. For that reason, appellees may yet prevail on remand, and I do not believe that the Court's approach entails a relaxation of ""the unwavering vigilance that the Constitution requires against any law `respecting an establishment of religion.' "" See post, at 648 (quoting U. S. Const., Amdt. 1); cf. post, at 630, n. 4.
The need for detailed factual findings by the District Court stems in part from the delicacy of the task given to the Executive Branch by the Adolescent Family Life Act (AFLA). Government has a strong and legitimate secular interest in encouraging sexual restraint among young people. At the same time, as the dissent rightly points out, ""[t]here is a very real and important difference between running a soup kitchen or a hospital, and counseling pregnant teenagers on how to make the difficult decisions facing them."" Post, at 641. Using religious organizations to advance the secular goals of the AFLA, without thereby permitting religious indoctrination, is inevitably more difficult than in other projects, such as ministering to the poor and the sick. I nonetheless agree with the Court that the partnership between governmental and religious institutions contemplated by the AFLA need not result in constitutional violations, despite an undeniably greater risk than is present in cooperative undertakings that involve less sensitive objectives. If the District Court finds *624 on remand that grants are being made in violation of the Establishment Clause, an appropriate remedy would take into account the history of the program's administration as well as the extent of any continuing constitutional violations."
17825,Justice Rehnquist,majority,False,Bowen v. Kendrick,,1988,1.0,"This litigation involves a challenge to a federal grant program that provides funding for services relating to adolescent sexuality and pregnancy. Considering the federal statute both ""on its face"" and ""as applied,"" the District Court ruled that the statute violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment insofar as it provided for the involvement of religious organizations in the federally funded programs. We conclude, however, that the statute is not unconstitutional on its face, and that a determination of whether any of the grants made pursuant to the statute violate the Establishment Clause requires further proceedings in the District Court.

I
The Adolescent Family Life Act (AFLA or Act), Pub. L. 97-35, 95 Stat. 578, 42 U.S. C. § 300z et seq. (1982 ed. and Supp. IV), was passed by Congress in 1981 in response to the ""severe adverse health, social, and economic consequences"" that often follow pregnancy and childbirth among unmarried adolescents. 42 U.S. C. § 300z(a)(5) (1982 ed., Supp. IV). Like its predecessor, the Adolescent Health Services and Pregnancy Prevention and Care Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95-626, Tit. VI, 92 Stat. 3595-3601 (Title VI), the AFLA is essentially a scheme for providing grants to public or nonprofit private organizations or agencies ""for services and research in the area of premarital adolescent sexual relations and pregnancy."" S. Rep. No. 97-161, p. 1 (1981) (hereinafter Senate Report). These grants are intended to serve several purposes, including the promotion of ""self discipline and other prudent approaches to the problem of adolescent premarital sexual relations,"" § 300z(b)(1), the promotion of adoption as an alternative for adolescent parents, § 300z(b)(2), the *594 establishment of new approaches to the delivery of care services for pregnant adolescents, § 300z(b)(3), and the support of research and demonstration projects ""concerning the societal causes and consequences of adolescent premarital sexual relations, contraceptive use, pregnancy, and child rearing,"" § 300z(b)(4).
In pertinent part, grant recipients are to provide two types of services: ""care services,"" for the provision of care to pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents, § 300z-1(a)(7), and ""prevention services,"" for the prevention of adolescent sexual relations, § 300z-1(a)(8).[1] While the AFLA leaves it up to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to define exactly what types of services a grantee must provide, see §§ 300z-1(a)(7), (8), 300z-1(b), the statute contains a listing of ""necessary services"" that may be funded. These services include pregnancy testing and maternity counseling, adoption counseling and referral services, prenatal and postnatal health care, nutritional information, counseling, child care, mental health services, and perhaps most importantly for present purposes, ""educational services relating to family life and problems associated with adolescent premarital sexual relations,"" § 300z-1(a)(4).[2]
*595 In drawing up the AFLA and determining what services to provide under the Act, Congress was well aware that ""the problems of adolescent premarital sexual relations, pregnancy, and parenthood are multiple and complex."" § 300z(a) (8)(A). Indeed, Congress expressly recognized that legislative or governmental action alone would be insufficient:
""[S]uch problems are best approached through a variety of integrated and essential services provided to adolescents and their families by other family members, religious and charitable organizations, voluntary associations, and other groups in the private sector as well as services provided by publicly sponsored initiatives."" § 300z(a)(8)(B).
*596 Accordingly, the AFLA expressly states that federally provided services in this area should promote the involvement of parents, and should ""emphasize the provision of support by other family members, religious and charitable organizations, voluntary associations, and other groups."" § 300z(a)(10)(C). The AFLA implements this goal by providing in § 300z-2 that demonstration projects funded by the government
""shall use such methods as will strengthen the capacity of families to deal with the sexual behavior, pregnancy, or parenthood of adolescents and to make use of support systems such as other family members, friends, religious and charitable organizations, and voluntary associations.""
In addition, AFLA requires grant applicants, among other things, to describe how they will, ""as appropriate in the provision of services[,] involve families of adolescents[, and] involve religious and charitable organizations, voluntary associations, and other groups in the private sector as well as services provided by publicly sponsored initiatives."" § 300z-5(a)(21). This broad-based involvement of groups outside of the government was intended by Congress to ""establish better coordination, integration, and linkages"" among existing programs in the community, § 300z(b)(3) (1982 ed., Supp. IV), to aid in the development of ""strong family values and close family ties,"" § 300z(a)(10)(A), and to ""help adolescents and their families deal with complex issues of adolescent premarital sexual relations and the consequences of such relations."" § 300z(a)(10)(C).
In line with its purposes, the AFLA also imposes limitations on the use of funds by grantees. First, the AFLA expressly states that no funds provided for demonstration projects under the statute may be used for family planning services (other than counseling and referral services) unless appropriate family planning services are not otherwise available in the community. § 300z-3(b)(1). Second, the AFLA restricts the awarding of grants to ""programs or projects *597 which do not provide abortions or abortion counseling or referral,"" except that the program may provide referral for abortion counseling if the adolescent and her parents request such referral. § 300z-10(a). Finally, the AFLA states that ""grants may be made only to projects or programs which do not advocate, promote, or encourage abortion."" § 300z-10(a).[3]
Since 1981, when the AFLA was adopted, the Secretary has received 1,088 grant applications and awarded 141 grants. Brief for Federal Appellant 8. Funding has gone to a wide variety of recipients, including state and local health agencies, private hospitals, community health associations, privately operated health care centers, and community and charitable organizations. It is undisputed that a number of grantees or subgrantees were organizations with institutional ties to religious denominations. See App. 748-756 (listing grantees).
In 1983, this lawsuit against the Secretary was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by appellees, a group of federal taxpayers, clergymen, and the American Jewish Congress. Seeking both declaratory and injunctive relief, appellees challenged the constitutionality of the AFLA on the grounds that on its face and as applied the statute violates the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment.[4] Following cross-motions for summary judgment, the *598 District Court held for appellees and declared that the AFLA was invalid both on its face and as applied ""insofar as religious organizations are involved in carrying out the programs and purposes of the Act."" 657 F. Supp. 1547, 1570 (DC 1987).
The court first found that under Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83 (1968), appellees had standing to challenge the statute both on its face and as applied. Turning to the merits, the District Court applied the three-part test for Establishment Clause cases set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971).[5] The court concluded that the AFLA has a valid secular purpose: the prevention of social and economic injury caused by teenage pregnancy and premarital sexual relations. In the court's view, however, the AFLA does not survive the second prong of the Lemon test because it has the ""direct and immediate"" effect of advancing religion insofar as it expressly requires grant applicants to describe how they will involve religious organizations in the provision of services. § 300z-5(a)(21)(B). The statute also permits religious organizations to be grantees and ""envisions a direct role for those organizations in the education and counseling components of AFLA grants."" 657 F. Supp., at 1562. As written, the AFLA makes it possible for religiously affiliated grantees to teach adolescents on issues that can be considered ""fundamental elements of religious doctrine."" The *599 AFLA does all this without imposing any restriction whatsoever against the teaching of ""religion qua religion"" or the inculcation of religious beliefs in federally funded programs. As the District Court put it, ""[t]o presume that AFLA counselors from religious organizations can put their beliefs aside when counseling an adolescent on matters that are part of religious doctrine is simply unrealistic."" Id., at 1563 (citing Grand Rapids School District v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373 (1985)).
The District Court then concluded that the statute as applied also runs afoul of the Lemon effects test.[6] The evidence presented by appellees revealed that AFLA grants had gone to various organizations that were affiliated with religious denominations and that had corporate requirements that the organizations abide by religious doctrines. Other AFLA grantees were not explicitly affiliated with organized religions, but were ""religiously inspired and dedicated to teaching the dogma that inspired them."" 657 F. Supp., at 1564. In the District Court's view, the record clearly established that the AFLA, as it has been administered by the Secretary, has in fact directly advanced religion, provided funding for institutions that were ""pervasively sectarian,"" or allowed federal funds to be used for education and counseling that ""amounts to the teaching of religion."" Ibid. As to the entanglement prong of Lemon, the court ruled that because AFLA funds are used largely for counseling and teaching, it would require overly intrusive monitoring or oversight to ensure that religion is not advanced by religiously affiliated AFLA grantees. Indeed, the court felt that ""it is impossible to comprehend entanglement more extensive and continuous *600 than that necessitated by the AFLA."" 657 F. Supp., at 1568.[7]
In a separate order, filed August 13, 1987, the District Court ruled that the ""constitutionally infirm language of the AFLA, namely its references to `religious organizations,' "" App. to Juris. Statement in No. 431, p. 53a, is severable from the Act pursuant to Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U.S. 678 (1987). The court also denied the Secretary's Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) motion to clarify what the court meant by ""religious organizations"" for purposes of determining the scope of its injunction. On the same day that this order was entered, appellants docketed their appeal on the merits directly with this Court pursuant to 28 U.S. C. § 1252. A separate appeal from the District Court's August 13 order was also docketed, as was a cross-appeal by appellees on the severability issue. On November 9, 1987, we noted probable jurisdiction in all three appeals and consolidated the cases for argument. 484 U.S. 942 (1987).

II
The District Court in this lawsuit held the AFLA unconstitutional both on its face and as applied. Few of our cases in the Establishment Clause area have explicitly distinguished between facial challenges to a statute and attacks on the statute as applied. Several cases have clearly involved challenges to a statute ""on its face."" For example, in Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578 (1987), we considered the validity of the Louisiana ""Creationism Act,"" finding the Act ""facially invalid."" Indeed, in that case it was clear that only a facial challenge could have been considered, as the Act had not been implemented. Id., at 581, n. 1. Other cases, as well, have considered the validity of statutes without the benefit of a record as to how the statute had actually been applied. *601 See Wolman v. Walter, 433 U.S. 229 (1977); Committee for Public Education & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756 (1973).
In other cases we have, in the course of determining the constitutionality of a statute, referred not only to the language of the statute but also to the manner in which it had been administered in practice. Levitt v. Committee for Public Education & Religious Liberty, 413 U.S. 472, 479 (1973); Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U.S. 349 (1975). See also Grand Rapids School District v. Ball, supra, at 377-379; Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U.S. 402 (1985). In several cases we have expressly recognized that an otherwise valid statute authorizing grants might be challenged on the grounds that the award of a grant in a particular case would be impermissible. Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734 (1973), involved a challenge to a South Carolina statute that provided for the issuance of revenue bonds to assist ""institutions of higher learning"" in constructing new facilities. The plaintiffs in that case did not contest the validity of the statute as a whole, but contended only that a statutory grant to a religiously affiliated college would be invalid. Id., at 736. In Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672 (1971), the Court reviewed a federal statute authorizing construction grants to colleges exclusively for secular educational purposes. We rejected the contention that the statute was invalid ""on its face"" and ""as applied"" to the four church-related colleges that were named as defendants in the case. However, we did leave open the possibility that the statute might authorize grants which could be invalid, stating that ""[i]ndividual projects can be properly evaluated if and when challenges arise with respect to particular recipients and some evidence is then presented to show that the institution does in fact possess"" sectarian characteristics that might make a grant of aid to the institution constitutionally impermissible. Id., at 682. See also Roemer v. Maryland Bd. of Public Works, 426 U.S. 736, 760-761 (1976) (upholding a similar statute authorizing grants to colleges against *602 a ""facial"" attack and pretermitting the question whether ""particular applications may result in unconstitutional use of funds"").
There is, then, precedent in this area of constitutional law for distinguishing between the validity of the statute on its face and its validity in particular applications. Although the Court's opinions have not even adverted to (to say nothing of explicitly delineated) the consequences of this distinction between ""on its face"" and ""as applied"" in this context, we think they do justify the District Court's approach in separating the two issues as it did here.
This said, we turn to consider whether the District Court was correct in concluding that the AFLA was unconstitutional on its face. As in previous cases involving facial challenges on Establishment Clause grounds, e. g., Edwards v. Aguillard, supra; Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388 (1983), we assess the constitutionality of an enactment by reference to the three factors first articulated in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). Under the Lemon standard, which guides ""[t]he general nature of our inquiry in this area,"" Mueller v. Allen, supra, at 394, a court may invalidate a statute only if it is motivated wholly by an impermissible purpose, Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 680 (1984); Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S. 39, 41 (1980), if its primary effect is the advancement of religion, Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, Inc., 472 U.S. 703, 708 (1985), or if it requires excessive entanglement between church and state, Lemon, supra, at 613; Walz v. Tax Comm'n, 397 U.S. 664, 674 (1970). We consider each of these factors in turn.
As we see it, it is clear from the face of the statute that the AFLA was motivated primarily, if not entirely, by a legitimate secular purpose  the elimination or reduction of social and economic problems caused by teenage sexuality, pregnancy, and parenthood. See §§ 300z(a), (b) (1982 ed. and Supp. IV). Appellees cannot, and do not, dispute that, on the whole, religious concerns were not the sole motivation *603 behind the Act, see Lynch, supra, at 680, nor can it be said that the AFLA lacks a legitimate secular purpose, see Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S., at 585. In the court below, however, appellees argued that the real purpose of the AFLA could only be understood in reference to the AFLA's predecessor, Title VI. Appellees contended that Congress had an impermissible purpose in adopting the AFLA because it specifically amended Title VI to increase the role of religious organizations in the programs sponsored by the Act. In particular, they pointed to the fact that the AFLA, unlike Title VI, requires grant applicants to describe how they will involve religious organizations in the programs funded by the AFLA. § 300z-5(a)(21)(B).
The District Court rejected this argument, however, reasoning that even if it is assumed that the AFLA was motivated in part by improper concerns, the parts of the statute to which appellees object were also motivated by other, entirely legitimate secular concerns. We agree with this conclusion. As the District Court correctly pointed out, Congress amended Title VI in a number of ways, most importantly for present purposes by attempting to enlist the aid of not only ""religious organizations,"" but also ""family members. . . , charitable organizations, voluntary associations, and other groups in the private sector,"" in addressing the problems associated with adolescent sexuality. § 300z(a)(8)(B); see also §§ 300z-5(a)(21)(A), (B). Cf. Title VI, § 601(a) (5) (""[T]he problems of adolescent [sexuality] . . . are best approached through a variety of integrated and essential services""). Congress' decision to amend the statute in this way reflects the entirely appropriate aim of increasing broad-based community involvement ""in helping adolescent boys and girls understand the implications of premarital sexual relations, pregnancy, and parenthood."" See Senate Report, at 2, 15-16. In adopting the AFLA, Congress expressly intended to expand the services already authorized by Title VI, to insure the increased participation of parents in education *604 and support services, to increase the flexibility of the programs, and to spark the development of new, innovative services. Id., at 7-9. These are all legitimate secular goals that are furthered by the AFLA's additions to Title VI, including the challenged provisions that refer to religious organizations. There simply is no evidence that Congress' ""actual purpose"" in passing the AFLA was one of ""endorsing religion."" See Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S., at 589-594. Nor are we in a position to doubt that Congress' expressed purposes are ""sincere and not a sham."" Id., at 587.[8]
As usual in Establishment Clause cases, see, e. g., Grand Rapids School District v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373 (1985); Mueller, supra, the more difficult question is whether the primary effect of the challenged statute is impermissible. Before we address this question, however, it is useful to review again just what the AFLA sets out to do. Simply stated, it authorizes grants to institutions that are capable of providing certain care and prevention services to adolescents. Because of the complexity of the problems that Congress sought to remedy, potential grantees are required to describe how they will involve other organizations, including religious organizations, in the programs funded by the federal grants. § 300z-5(a)(21)(B); see also § 300z-2(a). There is no requirement in the Act that grantees be affiliated with any religious denomination, although the Act clearly does not rule out grants to religious organizations.[9] The services to be provided *605 under the AFLA are not religious in character, see n. 2, supra, nor has there been any suggestion that religious institutions or organizations with religious ties are uniquely well qualified to carry out those services.[10] Certainly it is true that a substantial part of the services listed as ""necessary services"" under the Act involve some sort of education or counseling, see, e. g., §§ 300z-1(a)(4)(D), (G), (H), (J), (L), (M), (O), but there is nothing inherently religious about these activities and appellees do not contend that, by themselves, the AFLA's ""necessary services"" somehow have the primary effect of advancing religion. Finally, it is clear that the AFLA takes a particular approach toward dealing with adolescent sexuality and pregnancy  for example, two of its stated purposes are to ""promote self discipline and other prudent approaches to the problem of adolescent premarital sexual relations,"" § 300z(b)(1), and to ""promote adoption as an alternative,"" 300z(b)(2)  but again, that approach is not inherently religious, although it may coincide with the approach taken by certain religions.
Given this statutory framework, there are two ways in which the statute, considered ""on its face,"" might be said to have the impermissible primary effect of advancing religion. First, it can be argued that the AFLA advances religion by expressly recognizing that ""religious organizations have a role to play"" in addressing the problems associated with teenage *606 sexuality. Senate Report, at 16. In this view, even if no religious institution receives aid or funding pursuant to the AFLA, the statute is invalid under the Establishment Clause because, among other things, it expressly enlists the involvement of religiously affiliated organizations in the federally subsidized programs, it endorses religious solutions to the problems addressed by the Act, or it creates symbolic ties between church and state. Secondly, it can be argued that the AFLA is invalid on its face because it allows religiously affiliated organizations to participate as grantees or subgrantees in AFLA programs. From this standpoint, the Act is invalid because it authorizes direct federal funding of religious organizations which, given the AFLA's educational function and the fact that the AFLA's ""viewpoint"" may coincide with the grantee's ""viewpoint"" on sexual matters, will result unavoidably in the impermissible ""inculcation"" of religious beliefs in the context of a federally funded program.
We consider the former objection first. As noted previously, the AFLA expressly mentions the role of religious organizations in four places. It states (1) that the problems of teenage sexuality are ""best approached through a variety of integrated and essential services provided to adolescents and their families by[, among others,] religious organizations,"" § 300z(a)(8)(B), (2) that federally subsidized services ""should emphasize the provision of support by[, among others,] religious and charitable organizations,"" § 300z(a)(10)(C), (3) that AFLA programs ""shall use such methods as will strengthen the capacity of families . . . to make use of support systems such as . . . religious . . . organizations,"" § 300z-2(a), and (4) that grant applicants shall describe how they will involve religious organizations, among other groups, in the provision of services under the Act. § 300z-5(a)(21)(B).
Putting aside for the moment the possible role of religious organizations as grantees, these provisions of the statute reflect at most Congress' considered judgment that religious organizations can help solve the problems to which the *607 AFLA is addressed. See Senate Report, at 15-16. Nothing in our previous cases prevents Congress from making such a judgment or from recognizing the important part that religion or religious organizations may play in resolving certain secular problems. Particularly when, as Congress found, ""prevention of adolescent sexual activity and adolescent pregnancy depends primarily upon developing strong family values and close family ties,"" § 300z(a)(10)(A), it seems quite sensible for Congress to recognize that religious organizations can influence values and can have some influence on family life, including parents' relations with their adolescent children. To the extent that this congressional recognition has any effect of advancing religion, the effect is at most ""incidental and remote."" See Lynch, 465 U. S., at 683; Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, Inc., 472 U. S., at 710; Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 771. In addition, although the AFLA does require potential grantees to describe how they will involve religious organizations in the provision of services under the Act, it also requires grantees to describe the involvement of ""charitable organizations, voluntary associations, and other groups in the private sector,"" § 300z-5(a)(21)(B).[11] In our view, this reflects the statute's successful maintenance of ""a course of neutrality among religions, and between religion and non-religion,"" Grand Rapids School District v. Ball, 473 U. S., at 382.
*608 This brings us to the second ground for objecting to the AFLA: the fact that it allows religious institutions to participate as recipients of federal funds. The AFLA defines an ""eligible grant recipient"" as a ""public or nonprofit private organization or agency"" which demonstrates the capability of providing the requisite services. § 300z-1(a)(3). As this provision would indicate, a fairly wide spectrum of organizations is eligible to apply for and receive funding under the Act, and nothing on the face of the Act suggests it is anything but neutral with respect to the grantee's status as a sectarian or purely secular institution. See Senate Report, at 16 (""Religious affiliation is not a criterion for selection as a grantee . . .""). In this regard, then, the AFLA is similar to other statutes that this Court has upheld against Establishment Clause challenges in the past. In Roemer v. Maryland Bd. of Public Works, 426 U.S. 736 (1976), for example, we upheld a Maryland statute that provided annual subsidies directly to qualifying colleges and universities in the State, including religiously affiliated institutions. As the plurality stated, ""religious institutions need not be quarantined from public benefits that are neutrally available to all."" Id., at 746 (discussing Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1 (1947) (approving busing services equally available to both public and private school children), and Board of Education v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236 (1968) (upholding state provision of secular textbooks for both public and private school students)). Similarly, in Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672 (1971), we approved the federal Higher Educational Facilities Act, which was intended by Congress to provide construction grants to ""all colleges and universities regardless of any affiliation with or sponsorship by a religious body."" Id., at 676. And in Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734 (1973), we rejected a challenge to a South Carolina statute that made certain benefits ""available to all institutions of higher education in South Carolina, whether or not having a religious affiliation."" Id., at 741. In other cases involving indirect *609 grants of state aid to religious institutions, we have found it important that the aid is made available regardless of whether it will ultimately flow to a secular or sectarian institution. See, e. g., Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for Blind, 474 U.S. 481, 487 (1986); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S., at 398; Everson v. Board of Education, supra, at 17-18; Walz v. Tax Comm'n, 397 U. S., at 676.
We note in addition that this Court has never held that religious institutions are disabled by the First Amendment from participating in publicly sponsored social welfare programs. To the contrary, in Bradfield v. Roberts, 175 U.S. 291 (1899), the Court upheld an agreement between the Commissioners of the District of Columbia and a religiously affiliated hospital whereby the Federal Government would pay for the construction of a new building on the grounds of the hospital. In effect, the Court refused to hold that the mere fact that the hospital was ""conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church"" was sufficient to alter the purely secular legal character of the corporation, id., at 298, particularly in the absence of any allegation that the hospital discriminated on the basis of religion or operated in any way inconsistent with its secular charter. In the Court's view, the giving of federal aid to the hospital was entirely consistent with the Establishment Clause, and the fact that the hospital was religiously affiliated was ""wholly immaterial."" Ibid. The propriety of this holding, and the long history of cooperation and interdependency between governments and charitable or religious organizations is reflected in the legislative history of the AFLA. See S. Rep. No. 98-496, p. 10 (1984) (""Charitable organizations with religious affiliations historically have provided social services with the support of their communities and without controversy"").
Of course, even when the challenged statute appears to be neutral on its face, we have always been careful to ensure that direct government aid to religiously affiliated institutions does not have the primary effect of advancing religion. *610 One way in which direct government aid might have that effect is if the aid flows to institutions that are ""pervasively sectarian."" We stated in Hunt that
""[a]id normally may be thought to have a primary effect of advancing religion when it flows to an institution in which religion is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission. . . ."" 413 U.S., at 743.
The reason for this is that there is a risk that direct government funding, even if it is designated for specific secular purposes, may nonetheless advance the pervasively sectarian institution's ""religious mission."" See Grand Rapids School District v. Ball, 473 U. S., at 385 (discussing how aid to religious schools may impermissibly advance religion). Accordingly, a relevant factor in deciding whether a particular statute on its face can be said to have the improper effect of advancing religion is the determination of whether, and to what extent, the statute directs government aid to pervasively sectarian institutions. In Grand Rapids School District, for example, the Court began its ""effects"" inquiry with ""a consideration of the nature of the institutions in which the [challenged] programs operate."" Id., at 384.
In this lawsuit, nothing on the face of the AFLA indicates that a significant proportion of the federal funds will be disbursed to ""pervasively sectarian"" institutions. Indeed, the contention that there is a substantial risk of such institutions receiving direct aid is undercut by the AFLA's facially neutral grant requirements, the wide spectrum of public and private organizations which are capable of meeting the AFLA's requirements, and the fact that, of the eligible religious institutions, many will not deserve the label of ""pervasively sectarian.""[12] This is not a case like Grand Rapids, where the *611 challenged aid flowed almost entirely to parochial schools. In that case the State's ""Shared Time"" program was directed specifically at providing certain classes for nonpublic schools, and 40 of 41 of the schools that actually participated in the program were found to be ""pervasively sectarian."" Id., at 385. See also Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 768 ("" `all or practically all' "" of the schools entitled to receive grants were religiously affiliated); Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S., at 371. Instead, this litigation more closely resembles Tilton and Roemer, where it was foreseeable that some proportion of the recipients of government aid would be religiously affiliated, but that only a small portion of these, if any, could be considered ""pervasively sectarian."" In those cases we upheld the challenged statutes on their face and as applied to the institutions named in the complaints, but left open the consequences which would ensue if they allowed federal aid to go to institutions that were in fact pervasively sectarian. Tilton, 403 U. S., at 682; Roemer, 426 U. S., at 760. As in Tilton and Roemer, we do not think the possibility that AFLA grants may go to religious institutions that can be considered ""pervasively sectarian"" is sufficient to conclude that no grants whatsoever can be given under the statute to religious organizations. We think that the District Court was wrong in concluding otherwise.
Nor do we agree with the District Court that the AFLA necessarily has the effect of advancing religion because the religiously affiliated AFLA grantees will be providing educational and counseling services to adolescents. Of course, we have said that the Establishment Clause does ""prohibit government-financed or government-sponsored indoctrination into the beliefs of a particular religious faith,"" Grand *612 Rapids, supra, at 385, and we have accordingly struck down programs that entail an unacceptable risk that government funding would be used to ""advance the religious mission"" of the religious institution receiving aid. See, e. g., Meek, supra, at 370. But nothing in our prior cases warrants the presumption adopted by the District Court that religiously affiliated AFLA grantees are not capable of carrying out their functions under the AFLA in a lawful, secular manner. Only in the context of aid to ""pervasively sectarian"" institutions have we invalidated an aid program on the grounds that there was a ""substantial"" risk that aid to these religious institutions would, knowingly or unknowingly, result in religious indoctrination. E. g., Grand Rapids, supra, at 387-398; Meek, supra, at 371. In contrast, when the aid is to flow to religiously affiliated institutions that were not pervasively sectarian, as in Roemer, we refused to presume that it would be used in a way that would have the primary effect of advancing religion. Roemer, we refused to presume that it would be used in a way that would have the primary effect of advancing religion. Roemer, 426 U. S., at 760 (""We must assume that the colleges . . . will exercise their delegated control over use of the funds in compliance with the statutory, and therefore the constitutional, mandate""). We think that the type of presumption that the District Court applied in this case is simply unwarranted. As we stated in Roemer: ""It has not been the Court's practice, in considering facial challenges to statutes of this kind, to strike them down in anticipation that particular applications may result in unconstitutional use of funds."" Id., at 761; see also Tilton, supra, at 682.
We also disagree with the District Court's conclusion that the AFLA is invalid because it authorizes ""teaching"" by religious grant recipients on ""matters [that] are fundamental elements of religious doctrine,"" such as the harm of premarital sex and the reasons for choosing adoption over abortion. 657 F. Supp., at 1562. On an issue as sensitive and important as teenage sexuality, it is not surprising that the Government's secular concerns would either coincide or conflict *613 with those of religious institutions. But the possibility or even the likelihood that some of the religious institutions who receive AFLA funding will agree with the message that Congress intended to deliver to adolescents through the AFLA is insufficient to warrant a finding that the statute on its face has the primary effect of advancing religion. See Lynch, 465 U. S., at 682; id., at 715-716 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting); Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 319-320 (1980). Nor does the alignment of the statute and the religious views of the grantees run afoul of our proscription against ""fund[ing] a specifically religious activity in an otherwise substantially secular setting."" Hunt, 413 U. S., at 743. The facially neutral projects authorized by the AFLA  including pregnancy testing, adoption counseling and referral services, prenatal and postnatal care, educational services, residential care, child care, consumer education, etc.  are not themselves ""specifically religious activities,"" and they are not converted into such activities by the fact that they are carried out by organizations with religious affiliations.
As yet another reason for invalidating parts of the AFLA, the District Court found that the involvement of religious organizations in the Act has the impermissible effect of creating a ""crucial symbolic link"" between government and religion. 657 F. Supp., at 1564 (citing, e. g., Grand Rapids, 473 U. S., at 390). If we were to adopt the District Court's reasoning, it could be argued that any time a government aid program provides funding to religious organizations in an area in which the organization also has an interest, an impermissible ""symbolic link"" could be created, no matter whether the aid was to be used solely for secular purposes. This would jeopardize government aid to religiously affiliated hospitals, for example, on the ground that patients would perceive a ""symbolic link"" between the hospital  part of whose ""religious mission"" might be to save lives  and whatever government entity is subsidizing the purely secular medical services provided to the patient. We decline to adopt the *614 District Court's reasoning and conclude that, in this litigation, whatever ""symbolic link"" might in fact be created by the AFLA's disbursement of funds to religious institutions is not sufficient to justify striking down the statute on its face.
A final argument that has been advanced for striking down the AFLA on ""effects"" grounds is the fact that the statute lacks an express provision preventing the use of federal funds for religious purposes.[13] Cf. Tilton, 403 U. S., at 675; Roemer, supra, at 740-741. Clearly, if there were such a provision in this statute, it would be easier to conclude that the statute on its face could not be said to have the primary effect of advancing religion, see, e. g., Roemer, supra, at 760, but we have never stated that a statutory restriction is constitutionally required. The closest we came to such a holding was in Tilton, where we struck down a provision of the statute that would have eliminated Government sanctions for violating the statute's restrictions on religious uses of funds after 20 years. 403 U.S., at 683. The reason we did so, however, was because the 20-year limit on sanctions created a risk that the religious institution would, after the 20 years were up, act as if there were no longer any constitutional or statutory limitations on its use of the federally funded building. This aspect of the decision in Tilton was thus intended to indicate that the constitutional limitations on use of federal funds, as embodied in the statutory restriction, could not simply ""expire"" at some point during the economic life of the benefit that the grantee received from the Government. In this litigation, although there is no express statutory limitation on religious use of funds, there is also no intimation in the statute that at some point, or for some grantees, religious uses are permitted. To the contrary, the 1984 Senate Report on the AFLA states that ""the use of Adolescent Family Life Act funds to *615 promote religion, or to teach the religious doctrines of a particular sect, is contrary to the intent of this legislation."" S. Rep. No. 98-496, p. 10 (1984). We note in addition that the AFLA requires each grantee to undergo evaluations of the services it provides, § 300z-5(b)(1), and also requires grantees to ""make such reports concerning its use of Federal funds as the Secretary may require,"" § 300z-5(c). The application requirements of the Act, as well, require potential grantees to disclose in detail exactly what services they intend to provide and how they will be provided. § 300z-5(a). These provisions, taken together, create a mechanism whereby the Secretary can police the grants that are given out under the Act to ensure that federal funds are not used for impermissible purposes. Unlike some other grant programs, in which aid might be given out in one-time grants without ongoing supervision by the Government, the programs established under the authority of the AFLA can be monitored to determine whether the funds are, in effect, being used by the grantees in such a way as to advance religion. Given this statutory scheme, we do not think that the absence of an express limitation on the use of federal funds for religious purposes means that the statute, on its face, has the primary effect of advancing religion.
This, of course, brings us to the third prong of the Lemon Establishment Clause ""test""  the question whether the AFLA leads to "" `an excessive government entanglement with religion.' "" Lemon, 403 U. S., at 613 (quoting Walz v. Tax Comm'n, 397 U. S., at 674). There is no doubt that the monitoring of AFLA grants is necessary if the Secretary is to ensure that public money is to be spent in the way that Congress intended and in a way that comports with the Establishment Clause. Accordingly, this litigation presents us with yet another ""Catch-22"" argument: the very supervision of the aid to assure that it does not further religion renders the statute invalid. See Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S., at 421 (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting); id., at 418 (Powell, J., concurring) *616 (interaction of entanglement and effects tests forces schools ""to tread an extremely narrow line""); Roemer, 426 U. S., at 768-769 (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment). For this and other reasons, the ""entanglement"" prong of the Lemon test has been much criticized over the years. See, e. g., Aguilar v. Felton, supra, at 429 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting); Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 109-110 (1985) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting); Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S., at 689 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring); Lemon, supra, at 666-668 (WHITE, J., concurring and dissenting). Most of the cases in which the Court has divided over the ""entanglement"" part of the Lemon test have involved aid to parochial schools; in Aguilar v. Felton, for example, the Court's finding of excessive entanglement rested in large part on the undisputed fact that the elementary and secondary schools receiving aid were ""pervasively sectarian"" and had "" `as a substantial purpose the inculcation of religious values.' "" 473 U.S., at 411 (quoting Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 768); see also 473 U.S., at 411 (expressly distinguishing Roemer, Hunt, and Tilton as cases involving aid to institutions that were not pervasively sectarian). In Aguilar, the Court feared that an adequate level of supervision would require extensive and permanent on-site monitoring, 473 U.S., at 412-413, and would threaten both the ""freedom of religious belief of those who [were] not adherents of that denomination"" and the ""freedom of . . . the adherents of the denomination."" Id., at 409-410.
Here, by contrast, there is no reason to assume that the religious organizations which may receive grants are ""pervasively sectarian"" in the same sense as the Court has held parochial schools to be. There is accordingly no reason to fear that the less intensive monitoring involved here will cause the Government to intrude unduly in the day-to-day operation of the religiously affiliated AFLA grantees. Unquestionably, the Secretary will review the programs set up and run by the AFLA grantees, and undoubtedly this will involve a review of, for example, the educational materials that a *617 grantee proposes to use. The Secretary may also wish to have Government employees visit the clinics or offices where AFLA programs are being carried out to see whether they are in fact being administered in accordance with statutory and constitutional requirements. But in our view, this type of grant monitoring does not amount to ""excessive entanglement,"" at least in the context of a statute authorizing grants to religiously affiliated organizations that are not necessarily ""pervasively sectarian.""[14]
In sum, in this somewhat lengthy discussion of the validity of the AFLA on its face, we have concluded that the statute has a valid secular purpose, does not have the primary effect of advancing religion, and does not create an excessive entanglement of church and state. We note, as is proper given the traditional presumption in favor of the constitutionality of statutes enacted by Congress, that our conclusion that the statute does not violate the Establishment Clause is consistent with the conclusion Congress reached in the course of its deliberations on the AFLA. As the Senate Committee Report states:
""In the committee's view, provisions for the involvement of religious organizations [in the AFLA] do not violate the constitutional separation between church and state. Recognizing the limitations of Government in dealing with a problem that has complex moral and social dimensions, the committee believes that promoting the involvement of religious organizations in the solution to *618 these problems is neither inappropriate or illegal."" Senate Report, at 15-16.
For the foregoing reasons we conclude that the AFLA does not violate the Establishment Clause ""on its face.""

III
We turn now to consider whether the District Court correctly ruled that the AFLA was unconstitutional as applied. Our first task in this regard is to consider whether appellees had standing to raise this claim. In Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83 (1968), we held that federal taxpayers have standing to raise Establishment Clause claims against exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending power of Article I, § 8, of the Constitution. Although we have considered the problem of standing and Article III limitations on federal jurisdiction many times since then, we have consistently adhered to Flast and the narrow exception it created to the general rule against taxpayer standing established in Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447 (1923). Accordingly, in this case there is no dispute that appellees have standing to raise their challenge to the AFLA on its face. What is disputed, however, is whether appellees also have standing to challenge the statute as applied. The answer to this question turns on our decision in Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464 (1982). In Valley Forge, we ruled that taxpayers did not have standing to challenge a decision by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) to dispose of certain property pursuant to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 377, as amended, 40 U.S. C. § 471 et seq. We rejected the taxpayers' claim of standing for two reasons: first, because ""the source of their complaint is not a congressional action, but a decision by HEW to transfer a parcel of federal property,"" 454 U.S., at 479, and second, because ""the property transfer about which [the taxpayers] complain was not an exercise of *619 authority conferred by the Taxing and Spending Clause of Art. I, § 8,"" id., at 480. Appellants now contend that appellees' standing in this case is deficient for the former reason; they argue that a challenge to the AFLA ""as applied"" is really a challenge to executive action, not to an exercise of congressional authority under the Taxing and Spending Clause. We do not think, however, that appellees' claim that AFLA funds are being used improperly by individual grantees is any less a challenge to congressional taxing and spending power simply because the funding authorized by Congress has flowed through and been administered by the Secretary. Indeed, Flast itself was a suit against the Secretary of HEW, who had been given the authority under the challenged statute to administer the spending program that Congress had created. In subsequent cases, most notably Tilton, we have not questioned the standing of taxpayer plaintiffs to raise Establishment Clause challenges, even when their claims raised questions about the administratively made grants. See Tilton, 403 U. S., at 676; see also Hunt, 413 U. S., at 735-736 (not questioning standing of state taxpayer to file suit against state executive in an ""as applied"" challenge); Roemer, 426 U. S., at 744 (same). This is not a case like Valley Forge, where the challenge was to an exercise of executive authority pursuant to the Property Clause of Article IV, § 3, see 454 U.S., at 480, or Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208, 228 (1974), where the plaintiffs challenged the executive decision to allow Members of Congress to maintain their status as officers of the Armed Forces Reserve. See also United States v. Richardson, 418 U.S. 166, 175 (1974) (rejecting standing in challenge to statutes regulating the Central Intelligence Agency's accounting and reporting requirements). Nor is this, as we stated in Flast, a challenge to ""an incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute."" 392 U.S., at 102. The AFLA is at heart a program of disbursement of funds pursuant to Congress' *620 taxing and spending powers, and appellees' claims call into question how the funds authorized by Congress are being disbursed pursuant to the AFLA's statutory mandate. In this litigation there is thus a sufficient nexus between the taxpayer's standing as a taxpayer and the congressional exercise of taxing and spending power, notwithstanding the role the Secretary plays in administering the statute.[15]
On the merits of the ""as applied"" challenge, it seems to us that the District Court did not follow the proper approach in assessing appellees' claim that the Secretary is making grants under the Act that violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Although the District Court stated several times that AFLA aid had been given to religious organizations that were ""pervasively sectarian,"" see 657 F. Supp., at 1564, 1565, 1567, it did not identify which grantees it was referring to, nor did it discuss with any particularity the aspects of those organizations which in its view warranted classification as ""pervasively sectarian.""[16] The District Court did identify certain instances in which it felt AFLA funds were used for constitutionally improper purposes, but in our view the court did not adequately design its remedy to address the specific problems it found in the Secretary's administration of the statute. Accordingly, although there is no dispute that the record contains evidence of specific incidents of impermissible behavior by AFLA grantees, we feel that this lawsuit should be remanded to the District *621 Court for consideration of the evidence presented by appellees insofar as it sheds light on the manner in which the statute is presently being administered. It is the latter inquiry to which the court must direct itself on remand.
In particular, it will be open to appellees on remand to show that AFLA aid is flowing to grantees that can be considered ""pervasively sectarian"" religious institutions, such as we have held parochial schools to be. See Hunt, supra, at 743. As our previous discussion has indicated, and as Tilton, Hunt, and Roemer make clear, it is not enough to show that the recipient of a challenged grant is affiliated with a religious institution or that it is ""religiously inspired.""
The District Court should also consider on remand whether in particular cases AFLA aid has been used to fund ""specifically religious activit[ies] in an otherwise substantially secular setting."" Hunt, supra, at 743. In Hunt, for example, we deemed it important that the conditions on which the aid was granted were sufficient to preclude the possibility that funds would be used for the construction of a building used for religious purposes. Here it would be relevant to determine, for example, whether the Secretary has permitted AFLA grantees to use materials that have an explicitly religious content or are designed to inculcate the views of a particular religious faith. As we have pointed out in our previous discussion, evidence that the views espoused on questions such as premarital sex, abortion, and the like happen to coincide with the religious views of the AFLA grantee would not be sufficient to show that the grant funds are being used in such a way as to have a primary effect of advancing religion.
If the District Court concludes on the evidence presented that grants are being made by the Secretary in violation of the Establishment Clause, it should then turn to the question of the appropriate remedy. We deal here with a funding statute with respect to which Congress has expressed the view that the use of funds by grantees to promote religion, *622A or to teach religious doctrines of a particular sect, would be contrary to the intent of the statute. See S. Rep. No. 98-496, p. 10 (1984). The Secretary has promulgated a series of conditions to each grant, including a prohibition against teaching or promoting religion. See App. 757. While these strictures may not be coterminous with the requirements of the Establishment Clause, they make it very likely that any particular grant which would violate the Establishment Clause would also violate the statute and the grant conditions imposed by the Secretary. Should the court conclude that the Secretary has wrongfully approved certain AFLA grants, an appropriate remedy would require the Secretary to withdraw such approval.

IV
We conclude, first, that the District Court erred in holding that the AFLA is invalid on its face, and second, that the court should consider on remand whether particular AFLA grants have had the primary effect of advancing religion. Should the court conclude that the Secretary's current practice does allow such grants, it should devise a remedy to insure that grants awarded by the Secretary comply with the Constitution and the statute. The judgment of the District Court is accordingly
Reversed."
17827,Justice Blackmun,dissenting,False,Bowen v. Kendrick,,1988,1.0,"In 1981, Congress enacted the Adolescent Family Life Act (AFLA), 95 Stat. 578, 42 U.S. C. § 300z et seq. (1982 ed. and Supp. IV), thereby ""involv[ing] families[,] . . . religious and charitable organizations, voluntary associations, and other groups,"" § 300z-5(a)(21), in a broad-scale effort to alleviate some of the problems associated with teenage pregnancy. It is unclear whether Congress ever envisioned that public funds would pay for a program during a session of which parents and teenagers would be instructed:
""You want to know the church teachings on sexuality.. . . You are the church. You people sitting here are the body of Christ. The teachings of you and the things you value are, in fact, the values of the Catholic Church."" App. 226.
Or of curricula that taught:
""The Church has always taught that the marriage act, or intercourse, seals the union of husband and wife, (and is a representation of their union on all levels.) Christ commits Himself to us when we come to ask for the sacrament of marriage. We ask Him to be active in our life. God is love. We ask Him to share His love in ours, and God procreates with us, He enters into our physical union with Him, and we begin new life."" Id., at 372.
Or the teaching of a method of family planning described on the grant application as ""not only a method of birth regulation but also a philosophy of procreation,"" id., at 143, and promoted as helping ""spouses who are striving . . . to transform their married life into testimony[,] . . . to cultivate their matrimonial spirituality[, and] to make themselves better instruments *626 in God's plan,"" and as ""facilitat[ing] the evangelization of homes."" Id., at 385.
Whatever Congress had in mind, however, it enacted a statute that facilitated and, indeed, encouraged the use of public funds for such instruction, by giving religious groups a central pedagogical and counseling role without imposing any restraints on the sectarian quality of the participation. As the record developed thus far in this litigation makes all too clear, federal tax dollars appropriated for AFLA purposes have been used, with Government approval, to support religious teaching. Today the majority upholds the facial validity of this statute and remands the action to the District Court for further proceedings concerning appellees' challenge to the manner in which the statute has been applied. Because I am firmly convinced that our cases require invalidating this statutory scheme, I dissent.

I
The District Court, troubled by the lack of express guidance from this Court as to the appropriate manner in which to examine Establishment Clause challenges to an entire statute as well as to specific instances of its implementation, reluctantly proceeded to analyze the AFLA both ""on its face"" and ""as applied."" Thereafter, on cross-motions for summary judgment supported by an extensive record of undisputed facts, the District Court applied the three-pronged analysis of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), and declared the AFLA unconstitutional both facially and as applied. 657 F. Supp. 1547 (DC 1987). The majority acknowledges that this Court in some cases has passed on the facial validity of a legislative enactment and in others limited its analysis to the particular applications at issue; yet, while confirming that the District Court was justified in analyzing the AFLA both ways, the Court fails to elaborate on the consequences that flow from the analytical division.
*627 While the distinction is sometimes useful in constitutional litigation, the majority misuses it here to divide and conquer appellees' challenge.[1] By designating appellees' broad attack on the statute as a ""facial"" challenge, the majority justifies divorcing its analysis from the extensive record developed in the District Court, and thereby strips the challenge of much of its force and renders the evaluation of the Lemon ""effects"" prong particularly sterile and meaningless. By characterizing appellees' objections to the real-world operation of the AFLA an ""as-applied"" challenge, the Court risks misdirecting the litigants and the lower courts toward piece-meal litigation continuing indefinitely throughout the life of the AFLA. In my view, a more effective way to review Establishment Clause challenges is to look to the type of relief *628 prayed for by the plaintiffs, and the force of the arguments and supporting evidence they marshal. Whether we denominate a challenge that focuses on the systematically unconstitutional operation of a statute a ""facial"" challenge  because it goes to the statute as a whole  or an ""as-applied"" challenge  because we rely on real-world events  the Court should not blind itself to the facts revealed by the undisputed record.[2]
As is evident from the parties' arguments, the record compiled below, and the decision of the District Court, this law-suit has been litigated primarily as a broad challenge to the statutory scheme as a whole, not just to the awarding of grants to a few individual applicants. The thousands of pages of depositions, affidavits, and documentary evidence were not intended to demonstrate merely that particular grantees should not receive further funding. Indeed, because of the 5-year grant cycle, some of the original grantees are no longer AFLA participants. This record was designed to show that the AFLA had been interpreted and implemented by the Government in a manner that was clearly unconstitutional, and appellees sought declaratory and injunctive relief as to the entire statute.
*629 In discussing appellees' as-applied challenge, the District Court recognized that their objections went further than the validity of the particular grants under review:
""The undisputed record before the Court transforms the inherent conflicts between the AFLA and the Constitution into reality. . . . While the Court will not engage in an exhaustive recitation of the record, references to representative portions of the record reveal the extent to which the AFLA has in fact `directly and immediately' advanced religion, funded `pervasively sectarian' institutions, or permitted the use of federal tax dollars for education and counseling that amounts to the teaching of religion."" 657 F. Supp., at 1564 (footnote omitted).
The majority declines to accept the District Court's characterization of the record, yet fails to review it independently, relying instead on its assumptions and casual observations about the character of the grantees and potential grantees.[3]*630 See ante, at 610, 611-612, 616-617. In doing so, the Court neglects its responsibilities under the Establishment Clause and gives uncharacteristically short shrift to the District Court's understanding of the facts.[4]

II
Before proceeding to apply Lemon's three-part analysis to the AFLA, I pause to note a particular flaw in the majority's method. A central premise of the majority opinion seems to be that the primary means of ascertaining whether a statute that appears to be neutral on its face in fact has the effect of advancing religion is to determine whether aid flows to ""pervasively sectarian"" institutions. See ante, at 609-610, 616, 621. This misplaced focus leads the majority to ignore the substantial body of case law the Court has developed in analyzing programs providing direct aid to parochial schools, *631 and to rely almost exclusively on the few cases in which the Court has upheld the supplying of aid to private colleges, including religiously affiliated institutions.
""Pervasively sectarian,"" a vaguely defined term of art, has its roots in this Court's recognition that government must not engage in detailed supervision of the inner workings of religious institutions, and the Court's sensible distaste for the ""picture of state inspectors prowling the halls of parochial schools and auditing classroom instruction,"" Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S., at 650 (BRENNAN, J., concurring); see also Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U.S. 402, 411 (1985); Roemer v. Maryland Public Works Board, 426 U.S. 736, 762 (1976) (plurality opinion). Under the ""effects"" prong of the Lemon test, the Court has used one variant or another of the pervasively sectarian concept to explain why any but the most indirect forms of government aid to such institutions would necessarily have the effect of advancing religion. For example, in Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U.S. 349, 365 (1975), the Court explained:
""[I]t would simply ignore reality to attempt to separate secular educational functions from the predominantly religious role performed by many of Pennsylvania's church-related elementary and secondary schools and to then characterize Act 195 as channeling aid to the secular without providing direct aid to the sectarian.""
See also Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 743 (1973).
The majority first skews the Establishment Clause analysis by adopting a cramped view of what constitutes a pervasively sectarian institution. Perhaps because most of the Court's decisions in this area have come in the context of aid to parochial schools, which traditionally have been characterized as pervasively sectarian, the majority seems to equate the characterization with the institution.[5] In support of that *632 illusion, the majority relies heavily on three cases in which the Court has upheld direct government funding to liberal arts colleges with some religious affiliation, noting that such colleges were not ""pervasively sectarian."" But the happenstance that the few cases in which direct-aid statutes have been upheld have concerned religiously affiliated liberal arts colleges no more suggests that only parochial schools should be considered ""pervasively sectarian,"" than it suggests that the only religiously affiliated institutions that may ever receive direct government funding are private liberal arts colleges. In fact, the cases on which the majority relies have stressed that the institutions' ""predominant higher education mission is to provide their students with a secular education."" Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672, 687 (1971) (emphasis added); see Roemer v. Maryland Public Works Board, 426 U. S., at 755 (noting ""high degree of institutional autonomy"" and that ""the encouragement of spiritual development is only one secondary objective of each college"") (internal quotations omitted); Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S., at 744 (finding ""no basis to conclude that the College's operations are oriented significantly towards sectarian rather than secular education""). In sharp contrast, the District Court here concluded that AFLA grantees and participants included ""organizations with institutional ties to religious denominations and corporate requirements that the organizations abide by and not contradict religious doctrines. In addition, other recipients of AFLA funds, while not explicitly affiliated with a religious denomination, are religiously inspired and dedicated to teaching the dogma that inspired them"" (emphasis *633 added). 657 F. Supp., at 1564. On a continuum of ""sectarianism"" running from parochial schools at one end to the colleges funded by the statutes upheld in Tilton, Hunt, and Roemer at the other, the AFLA grantees described by the District Court clearly are much closer to the former than to the latter.
More importantly, the majority also errs in suggesting that the inapplicability of the label is generally dispositive. While a plurality of the Court has framed the inquiry as ""whether an institution is so `pervasively sectarian' that it may receive no direct state aid of any kind,"" Roemer v. Maryland Public Works Board, 426 U. S., at 758, the Court never has treated the absence of such a finding as a license to disregard the potential for impermissible fostering of religion. The characterization of an institution as ""pervasively sectarian"" allows us to eschew further inquiry into the use that will be made of direct government aid. In that sense, it is a sufficient, but not a necessary, basis for a finding that a challenged program creates an unacceptable Establishment Clause risk. The label thus serves in some cases as a proxy for a more detailed analysis of the institution, the nature of the aid, and the manner in which the aid may be used.
The voluminous record compiled by the parties and reviewed by the District Court illustrates the manner in which the AFLA has been interpreted and implemented by the agency responsible for the aid program, and eliminates whatever need there might be to speculate about what kind of institutions might receive funds and how they might be selected; the record explains the nature of the activities funded with Government money, as well as the content of the educational programs and materials developed and disseminated. There is no basis for ignoring the volumes of depositions, pleadings, and undisputed facts reviewed by the District Court simply because the recipients of the Government funds may not in every sense resemble parochial schools.


*634 III
As is often the case, it is the effect of the statute, rather than its purpose, that creates Establishment Clause problems. Because I have no meaningful disagreement with the majority's discussion of the AFLA's essentially secular purpose, and because I find the statute's effect of advancing religion dispositive, I turn to that issue directly.

A
The majority's holding that the AFLA is not unconstitutional on its face marks a sharp departure from our precedents. While aid programs providing nonmonetary, verifiably secular aid have been upheld notwithstanding the indirect effect they might have on the allocation of an institution's own funds for religious activities, see, e. g., Board of Education v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236 (1968) (lending secular textbooks to parochial schools); Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1 (1947) (providing bus services to parochial schools), direct cash subsidies have always required much closer scrutiny into the expected and potential uses of the funds, and much greater guarantees that the funds would not be used inconsistently with the Establishment Clause. Parts of the AFLA prescribing various forms of outreach, education, and counseling services[6] specifically authorize the expenditure of funds in ways previously held unconstitutional. For example, the Court has upheld the use of public funds to support a parochial school's purchase of secular textbooks already approved for use in public schools, see Wolman v. Walter, 433 U.S. 229, 236-238 (1977); Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S., at 359-362, or its grading and administering of state-prepared tests, Committee for Public Education & Religious Liberty v. Regan, 444 U.S. 646 (1980). When the books, teaching materials, or examinations were to *635 be selected or designed by the private schools themselves, however, the Court consistently has held that such government aid risked advancing religion impermissibly. See, e. g., Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S., at 248-251; Levitt v. Committee for Public Education & Religious Liberty, 413 U.S. 472 (1973); Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S., at 620-621. The teaching materials that may be purchased, developed, or disseminated with AFLA funding are in no way restricted to those already selected and approved for use in secular contexts.[7]
Notwithstanding the fact that Government funds are paying for religious organizations to teach and counsel impressionable adolescents on a highly sensitive subject of considerable religious significance, often on the premises of a church or parochial school and without any effort to remove religious symbols from the sites, 657 F. Supp., at 1565-1566, the majority concludes that the AFLA is not facially invalid. The majority acknowledges the constitutional proscription on *636 government-sponsored religious indoctrination but, on the basis of little more than an indefensible assumption that AFLA recipients are not pervasively sectarian and consequently are presumed likely to comply with statutory and constitutional mandates, dismisses as insubstantial the risk that indoctrination will enter counseling. Ante, at 611-612. Similarly, the majority rejects the District Court's conclusion that the subject matter renders the risk of indoctrination unacceptable, and does so, it says, because ""the likelihood that some of the religious institutions who receive AFLA funding will agree with the message that Congress intended to deliver to adolescents through the AFLA"" does not amount to the advancement of religion. Ante, at 613. I do not think the statute can be so easily and conveniently saved.

(1)
The District Court concluded that asking religious organizations to teach and counsel youngsters on matters of deep religious significance, yet expect them to refrain from making reference to religion is both foolhardy and unconstitutional. The majority's rejection of this view is illustrative of its doctrinal misstep in relying so heavily on the college-funding cases. The District Court reasoned:
""To presume that AFLA counselors from religious organizations can put their beliefs aside when counseling an adolescent on matters that are part of religious doctrine is simply unrealistic. . . . Even if it were possible, government would tread impermissibly on religious liberty merely by suggesting that religious organizations instruct on doctrinal matters without any conscious or unconscious reference to that doctrine. Moreover, the statutory scheme is fraught with the possibility that religious beliefs might infuse instruction and never be detected by the impressionable and unlearned adolescent to whom the instruction is directed"" (emphasis in original). 657 F. Supp., at 1563.
*637 The majority rejects the District Court's assumptions as unwarranted outside the context of a pervasively sectarian institution. In doing so, the majority places inordinate weight on the nature of the institution receiving the funds, and ignores altogether the targets of the funded message and the nature of its content.
I find it nothing less than remarkable that the majority relies on statements expressing confidence that administrators of religiously affiliated liberal arts colleges would not breach statutory proscriptions and use government funds earmarked ""for secular purposes only,"" to finance theological instruction or religious worship, see ante, at 612, citing Roemer, 426 U. S., at 760-761, and Tilton, 403 U. S., at 682, in order to reject a challenge based on the risk of indoctrination inherent in ""educational services relating to family life and problems associated with adolescent premarital sexual relations,"" or ""outreach services to families of adolescents to discourage sexual relations among unemancipated minors."" §§ 300z-1(a)(4)(G), (O). The two situations are simply not comparable.[8]
*638 The AFLA, unlike any statute this Court has upheld, pays for teachers and counselors, employed by and subject to the direction of religious authorities, to educate impressionable young minds on issues of religious moment. Time and again we have recognized the difficulties inherent in asking even the best-intentioned individuals in such positions to make ""a total separation between secular teaching and religious doctrine."" Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S., at 619. Accord, Levitt v. Committee for Public Education & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S., at 481; Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S., at 370-371; Roemer v. Maryland Public Works Board, 426 U. S., at 749 (plurality opinion); Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S., at 254; Grand Rapids School District v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 388 (1985). Where the targeted audience is composed of children, of course, the Court's insistence on adequate safeguards has always been greatest. See, e. g., Grand Rapids School District v. Ball, 473 U. S., at 383, 390; Committee for Public Education & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756, 796-798 (1973), Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S., at 622-624. In those cases in which funding of colleges with religious affiliations has been upheld, the Court has relied on the assumption that ""college students are less impressionable and less susceptible to religious indoctrination.. . . The skepticism of the college student is not an inconsiderable barrier to any attempt or tendency to subvert the congressional objectives and limitations"" (footnote omitted). Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S., at 686 (plurality opinion). See also Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 274, n. 14 (1981) (""University students are, of course, young adults. They are less impressionable than younger students and should be able to appreciate that the University's policy is one of neutrality toward religion"").

(2)
By observing that the alignment of the statute and the religious views of the grantees do not render the AFLA a statute which funds ""specifically religious activity,"" the majority *639 makes light of the religious significance in the counseling provided by some grantees. Yet this is a dimension that Congress specifically sought to capture by enlisting the aid of religious organizations in battling the problems associated with teenage pregnancy. See S. Rep. No. 97-161, pp. 15-16 (1981); S. Rep. No. 98-496, pp. 9-10 (1984). Whereas there may be secular values promoted by the AFLA, including the encouragement of adoption and premarital chastity and the discouragement of abortion, it can hardly be doubted that when promoted in theological terms by religious figures, those values take on a religious nature. Not surprisingly, the record is replete with observations to that effect.[9] It *640 should be undeniable by now that religious dogma may not be employed by government even to accomplish laudable secular purposes such as ""the promotion of moral values, the contradiction to the materialistic trends of our times, the perpetuation of our institutions and the teaching of literature."" Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 223 (1963) (holding unconstitutional daily reading of Bible verses and recitation of the Lord's Prayer in public schools); Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S. 39 (1980) (holding unconstitutional posting of Ten Commandments despite notation explaining secular application thereof).[10]
It is true, of course, that the Court has recognized that the Constitution does not prohibit the government from supporting secular social-welfare services solely because they are provided by a religiously affiliated organization. See ante, at 609. But such recognition has been closely tied to the nature of the subsidized social service: ""the State may send a *641 cleric, indeed even a clerical order, to perform a wholly secular task"" (emphasis added). Roemer v. Maryland Public Works Board, 426 U. S., at 746 (plurality opinion). There is a very real and important difference between running a soup kitchen or a hospital, and counseling pregnant teenagers on how to make the difficult decisions facing them. The risk of advancing religion at public expense, and of creating an appearance that the government is endorsing the medium and the message, is much greater when the religious organization is directly engaged in pedagogy, with the express intent of shaping belief and changing behavior, than where it is neutrally dispensing medication, food, or shelter.[11]
There is also, of course, a fundamental difference between government's employing religion because of its unique appeal to a higher authority and the transcendental nature of its message, and government's enlisting the aid of religiously committed individuals or organizations without regard to their sectarian motivation. In the latter circumstance, religion plays little or no role; it merely explains why the individual or organization has chosen to get involved in the publicly funded program. In the former, religion is at the core of the subsidized activity, and it affects the manner in which the ""service"" is dispensed. For some religious organizations, *642 the answer to a teenager's question ""Why shouldn't I have an abortion?"" or ""Why shouldn't I use barrier contraceptives?"" will undoubtedly be different from an answer based solely on secular considerations.[12] Public funds may not be used to endorse the religious message.

B
The problems inherent in a statutory scheme specifically designed to involve religious organizations in a government-funded pedagogical program are compounded by the lack of any statutory restrictions on the use of federal tax dollars to promote religion. Conscious of the remarkable omission from the AFLA of any restriction whatsoever on the use of public funds for sectarian purposes, the Court disingenuously argues that we have ""never stated that a statutory restriction is constitutionally required."" Ante, at 614. In Tilton v. Richardson, this Court upheld a statute providing grants and loans to colleges for the construction of academic facilities because it ""expressly prohibit[ed] their use for religious instruction, training, or worship . . . and the record show[ed] that some church-related institutions ha[d] been required to disgorge benefits for failure to obey"" the restriction, 403 U.S., at 679-680, but severed and struck a provision of the statute that permitted the restriction to lapse after 20 years. The Tilton Court noted that the statute required applicants to *643 provide assurances only that use of the funded facility would be limited to secular purposes for the initial 20-year period, and that this limitation, ""obviously opens the facility to use for any purpose at the end of that period."" Id., at 683. Because they expired after 20 years, ""the statute's enforcement provisions [were] inadequate to ensure that the impact of the federal aid will not advance religion."" Id., at 682.
The majority interprets Tilton ""to indicate that the constitutional limitations on use of federal funds, as embodied in the statutory restriction, could not simply `expire' "" after 20 years, but concludes that the absence of a statutory restriction in the AFLA is not troubling, because ""there is also no intimation in the statute that at some point, or for some grantees, religious uses are permitted."" Ante, at 614. Although there is something to the notion that the lifting of a pre-existing restriction may be more likely to be perceived as affirmative authorization than would the absence of any restriction at all, there was in Tilton no provision that stated that after 20 years facilities built under the aid program could be converted into chapels. What there was in Tilton was an express statutory provision, which lapsed, leaving no restrictions; it was that vacuum that the Court found constitutionally impermissible. In the AFLA, by way of contrast, there is a vacuum right from the start.[13]
*644 If Tilton were indeed the only indication that cash-grant programs must include prohibitions on the use of public funds to advance or endorse religion, one might argue more plausibly that ordinary reporting requirements, in conjunction with some presumption that Government agencies administer federal programs in a constitutional fashion,[14] might suffice to *645 protect a statute against facial challenge. That, however, is simply not the case. In Committee for Public Education & Religious Liberty v. Regan, 444 U.S. 646 (1980), for example, the Court upheld a state program whereby private schools were reimbursed for the actual cost of administering state-required tests. The statute specifically required that no payments be made for religious instruction and incorporated an extensive auditing system. The Court warned, however: ""Of course, under the relevant cases the outcome would likely be different were there no effective means for insuring that the cash reimbursements would cover only secular services."" Id., at 659. In this regard, the Regan Court merely echoed and reaffirmed what was already well established. In Committee for Public Education & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, the Court explained:
""Nothing in the statute, for instance, bars a qualifying school from paying out of state funds the salaries of employees who maintain the school chapel, or the cost of renovating classrooms in which religion is taught, or the cost of heating and lighting those same facilities. Absent appropriate restrictions on expenditures for these and similar purposes, it simply cannot be denied that this section has a primary effect that advances religion in that it subsidizes directly the religious activities of sectarian elementary and secondary schools"" (emphasis added). 413 U.S., at 774.
*646 See id., at 780 (""In the absence of an effective means of guaranteeing that the state aid derived from public funds will be used exclusively for secular, neutral, and nonideological purposes, it is clear from our cases that direct aid in whatever form is invalid""); Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S., at 621 (""The history of government grants of a continuing cash subsidy indicates that such programs have almost always been accompanied by varying measures of control and surveillance""). See also Roemer v. Maryland Public Works Board, 426 U. S., at 760 (upholding grant program containing statutory restriction on using state funds for ""sectarian purposes""); Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S., at 744 (noting that the statute at issue ""specifically states that a project `shall not include' any buildings or facilities used for religious purposes"").[15]
Despite the glaring omission of a restriction on the use of funds for religious purposes, the Court attempts to resurrect the AFLA by noting a legislative intent not to promote religion, and observing that various reporting provisions of the statute ""create a mechanism whereby the Secretary can police the grants."" Ante, at 615. However effective this ""mechanism"" might prove to be in enforcing clear statutory directives, it is of no help where, as here, no restrictions are found on the face of the statute, and the Secretary has not promulgated any by regulation. Indeed, the only restriction *647 on the use of AFLA funds for religious purposes is found in the Secretary's ""Notice of Grant Award"" sent to grantees, which specifies that public funds may not be used to ""teach or promote religion,"" 657 F. Supp., at 1563, n. 13, and apparently even that clause was not inserted until after this litigation was underway. Furthermore, the ""enforcement"" of the limitation on sectarian use of AFLA funds, such as it is, lacks any bite. There is no procedure pursuant to which funds used to promote religion must be refunded to the Government, as there was, for example, in Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S., at 682.
Indeed, nothing in the AFLA precludes the funding of even ""pervasively sectarian"" organizations, whose work by definition cannot be segregated into religious and secular categories. And, unlike a pre-enforcement challenge, where there is no record to review, or a limited challenge to a specific grant, where the Court is reluctant to invalidate a statute ""in anticipation that particular applications may result in unconstitutional use of funds,"" Roemer v. Maryland Public Works Board, 426 U. S., at 761, in this litigation the District Court expressly found that funds have gone to pervasively sectarian institutions and tax dollars have been used for the teaching of religion. 657 F. Supp., at 1564. Moreover, appellees have specifically called into question the manner in which the grant program was administered and grantees were selected. See n. 14, supra. These objections cannot responsibly be answered by reliance on the Secretary's enforcement mechanism. See, e. g., Levitt v. Committee for Public Education & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S., at 480 (""[T]he State is constitutionally compelled to assure that the state-supported activity is not being used for religious indoctrination""); Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S., at 619 (""The State must be certain, given the Religion Clauses, that subsidized teachers do not inculcate religion"").


*648 C
By placing unsupportable weight on the ""pervasively sectarian"" label, and recharacterizing appellees' objections to the statute, the Court attempts to create an illusion of consistency between our prior cases and its present ruling that the AFLA is not facially invalid. But the Court ignores the unwavering vigilance that the Constitution requires against any law ""respecting an establishment of religion,"" U. S. Const., Amdt. 1, which, as we have recognized time and again, calls for fundamentally conservative decisionmaking: our cases do not require a plaintiff to demonstrate that a government action necessarily promotes religion, but simply that it creates such a substantial risk. See, e. g., Grand Rapids School District v. Ball, 473 U. S., at 387 (observing a ""substantial risk that, overtly or subtly, the religious message . . . will infuse the supposedly secular classes""); Committee for Public Education & Religious Liberty v. Regan, 444 U. S., at 656 (describing as ""minimal"" the chance that religious bias would enter process of grading state-drafted tests in secular subjects, given ""complete"" state safeguards); Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S., at 254 (noting ""unacceptable risk of fostering of religion"" as ""an inevitable byproduct"" of teacher-accompanied field trips); Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S., at 372 (finding ""potential for impermissible fostering of religion""); Levitt v. Committee for Public Education & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S., at 480 (finding dispositive ""the substantial risk that. . . examinations, prepared by teachers under the authority of religious institutions, will be drafted with an eye, unconsciously or otherwise, to inculcate students in the religious precepts of the sponsoring church""); Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S., at 619 (finding ""potential for impermissible fostering of religion""). Given the nature of the subsidized activity, the lack of adequate safeguards, and the chronicle of past experience with this statute, there is no room for doubt that the AFLA creates a substantial risk of impermissible fostering of religion.


*649 IV
While it is evident that the AFLA does not pass muster under Lemon's ""effects"" prong, the unconstitutionality of the statute becomes even more apparent when we consider the unprecedented degree of entanglement between Church and State required to prevent subsidizing the advancement of religion with AFLA funds. The majority's brief discussion of Lemon's ""entanglement"" prong is limited to (a) criticizing it as a ""Catch-22,"" and (b) concluding that because there is ""no reason to assume that the religious organizations which may receive grants are `pervasively sectarian' in the same sense as the Court has held parochial schools to be,"" there is no need to be concerned about the degree of monitoring which will be necessary to ensure compliance with the AFLA and the Establishment Clause. Ante, at 615-616. As to the former, although the majority is certainly correct that the Court's entanglement analysis has been criticized in the separate writings of some Members of the Court, the question whether a government program leads to "" `an excessive government entanglement with religion' "" nevertheless is and remains a part of the applicable constitutional inquiry. Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S., at 613, quoting Walz v. Tax Comm'n, 397 U.S. 664, 674 (1970). I accept the majority's conclusion that ""[t]here is no doubt that the monitoring of AFLA grants is necessary . . . to ensure that public money is to be spent . . . in a way that comports with the Establishment Clause,"" ante, at 615, but disagree with its easy characterization of entanglement analysis as a ""Catch-22."" To the extent any metaphor is helpful, I would be more inclined to characterize the Court's excessive entanglement decisions as concluding that to implement the required monitoring, we would have to kill the patient to cure what ailed him. See, e. g., Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S., at 614-615; Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S., at 370; Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S., at 413-414.
*650 As to the Court's conclusion that our precedents do not indicate that the Secretary's monitoring will have to be exceedingly intensive or entangling, because the grant recipients are not sufficiently like parochial schools, I must disagree. As discussed above, the majority's excessive reliance on the distinction between the Court's parochial-school-aid cases and college-funding cases is unwarranted. Lemon, Meek, and Aguilar cannot be so conveniently dismissed solely because the majority declines to assume that the ""pervasively sectarian"" label can be applied here.
To determine whether a statute fosters excessive entanglement, a court must look at three factors: (1) the character and purpose of the institutions benefited; (2) the nature of the aid; and (3) the nature of the relationship between the government and the religious organization. See Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S., at 614-615. Thus, in Lemon, it was not solely the fact that teachers performed their duties within the four walls of the parochial school that rendered monitoring difficult and, in the end, unconstitutional. It seems inherent in the pedagogical function that there will be disagreements about what is or is not ""religious"" and which will require an intolerable degree of government intrusion and censorship.
""What would appear to some to be essential to good citizenship might well for others border on or constitute instruction in religion. . . .
.....
"". . . Unlike a book, a teacher cannot be inspected once so as to determine the extent and intent of his or her personal beliefs and subjective acceptance of the limitations imposed by the First Amendment."" Id., at 619.
Accord, Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S., at 413. See also New York v. Cathedral Academy, 434 U.S. 125, 133 (1977) (noting that the State ""would have to undertake a search *651 for religious meaning in every classroom examination . . . . The prospect of church and state litigating in court about what does or does not have religious meaning touches the very core of the constitutional guarantee against religious establishment"").
In Roemer, Tilton, and Hunt, the Court relied on ""the ability of the State to identify and subsidize separate secular functions carried out at the school, without on-the-site inspections being necessary to prevent diversion of the funds to sectarian purposes,"" Roemer v. Maryland Public Works Board, 426 U. S., at 765 (emphasis added), and on the fact that one-time grants require ""no continuing financial relationships or dependencies, no annual audits, and no government analysis of an institution's expenditures on secular as distinguished from religious activities."" Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S., at 688. AFLA grants, of course, are not simply one-time construction grants. As the majority readily acknowledges, the Secretary will have to ""review the programs set up and run by the AFLA grantees[, including] a review of, for example, the educational materials that a grantee proposes to use."" Ante, at 616-617. And, as the majority intimates, monitoring the use of AFLA funds will undoubtedly require more than the ""minimal"" inspection ""necessary to ascertain that the facilities are devoted to secular education,"" Tilton, 403 U. S., at 687. Since teachers and counselors, unlike buildings, ""are not necessarily religiously neutral, greater governmental surveillance would be required to guarantee that state salary aid would not in fact subsidize religious instruction."" Id., at 687-688.

V
The AFLA, without a doubt, endorses religion. Because of its expressed solicitude for the participation of religious organizations in all AFLA programs in one form or another, the statute creates a symbolic and real partnership between the clergy and the fisc in addressing a problem with substantial *652 religious overtones. Given the delicate subject matter and the impressionable audience, the risk that the AFLA will convey a message of Government endorsement of religion is overwhelming. The statutory language and the extensive record established in the District Court make clear that the problem lies in the statute and its systematically unconstitutional operation, and not merely in isolated instances of misapplication. I therefore would find the statute unconstitutional without remanding to the District Court. I trust, however, that after all its labors thus far, the District Court will not grow weary prematurely and read into the Court's decision a suggestion that the AFLA has been constitutionally implemented by the Government, for the majority deliberately eschews any review of the facts.[16] After such further *653 proceedings as are now to be deemed appropriate, and after the District Court enters findings of fact on the basis of the testimony and documents entered into evidence, it may well decide, as I would today, that the AFLA as a whole indeed has been unconstitutionally applied.[17]
"
27850,Justice O'Connor,concurring,False,Webster v. Reproductive Health Services,,1989,1.0,"I concur in Parts I, II-A, II-B, and II-C of the Court's opinion.

I
Nothing in the record before us or the opinions below indicates that subsections 1(1) and 1(2) of the preamble to Missouri's abortion regulation statute will affect a woman's decision to have an abortion. JUSTICE STEVENS, following appellees, see Brief for Appellees 22, suggests that the preamble may also ""interfer[e] with contraceptive choices,"" post, at 564, because certain contraceptive devices act on a female ovum after it has been fertilized by a male sperm. The Missouri Act defines ""conception"" as ""the fertilization of the ovum of a female by a sperm of a male,"" Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.015(3) (1986), and invests ""unborn children"" with ""protectable interests in life, health, and well-being,"" § 1.205.1(2), from ""the moment of conception . . . ."" § 1.205.3. JUSTICE STEVENS asserts that any possible interference with a woman's right to use such postfertilization contraceptive devices would be unconstitutional under Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), and our subsequent contraception cases. Post, at 564-566. Similarly, certain amici suggest that the Missouri Act's preamble may prohibit the developing technology of in vitro fertilization, a technique used to aid couples otherwise unable to bear children in which a number of ova are removed from the woman and fertilized by male sperm. This process often produces excess fertilized ova (""unborn children"" under the Missouri Act's definition) that are discarded rather than reinserted into the woman's uterus. Brief for Association of Reproductive Health Professionals *523 et al. as Amici Curiae 38. It may be correct that the use of postfertilization contraceptive devices is constitutionally protected by Griswold and its progeny, but, as with a woman's abortion decision, nothing in the record or the opinions below indicates that the preamble will affect a woman's decision to practice contraception. For that matter, nothing in appellees' original complaint, App. 8-21, or their motion in limine to limit testimony and evidence on their challenge to the preamble, id., at 57-59, indicates that appellees sought to enjoin potential violations of Griswold. Neither is there any indication of the possibility that the preamble might be applied to prohibit the performance of in vitro fertilization. I agree with the Court, therefore, that all of these intimations of unconstitutionality are simply too hypothetical to support the use of declaratory judgment procedures and injunctive remedies in this case.
Similarly, it seems to me to follow directly from our previous decisions concerning state or federal funding of abortions, Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980), Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464 (1977), and Poelker v. Doe, 432 U.S. 519 (1977), that appellees' facial challenge to the constitutionality of Missouri's ban on the utilization of public facilities and the participation of public employees in the performance of abortions not necessary to save the life of the mother, Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ 188.210, 188.215 (1986), cannot succeed. Given Missouri's definition of ""public facility"" as ""any public institution, public facility, public equipment, or any physical asset owned, leased, or controlled by this state or any agency or political subdivisions thereof,"" § 188.200(2), there may be conceivable applications of the ban on the use of public facilities that would be unconstitutional. Appellees and amici suggest that the State could try to enforce the ban against private hospitals using public water and sewage lines, or against private hospitals leasing state-owned equipment or state land. See Brief for Appellees 49-50; Brief for National Association of Public Hospitals as Amicus Curiae *524 9-12. Whether some or all of these or other applications of § 188.215 would be constitutional need not be decided here. Maher, Poelker, and McRae stand for the proposition that some quite straightforward applications of the Missouri ban on the use of public facilities for performing abortions would be constitutional and that is enough to defeat appellees' assertion that the ban is facially unconstitutional. ""A facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid. The fact that the [relevant statute] might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid, since we have not recognized an `overbreadth' doctrine outside the limited context of the First Amendment."" United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987).
I also agree with the Court that, under the interpretation of § 188.205 urged by the State and adopted by the Court, there is no longer a case or controversy before us over the constitutionality of that provision. I would note, however, that this interpretation of § 188.205 is not binding on the Supreme Court of Missouri which has the final word on the meaning of that State's statutes. Virginia v. American Booksellers Assn., Inc., 484 U.S. 383, 395 (1988); O'Brien v. Skinner, 414 U.S. 524, 531 (1974). Should it happen that § 188.205, as ultimately interpreted by the Missouri Supreme Court, does prohibit publicly employed health professionals from giving specific medical advice to pregnant women, ""the vacation and dismissal of the complaint that has become moot `clears the path for future relitigation of the issues between the parties,' should subsequent events rekindle their controversy."" Deakins v. Monaghan, 484 U.S. 193, 201, n. 5 (1988), quoting United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 40 (1950). Unless such events make their appearance and give rise to relitigation, I agree that we and all federal *525 courts are without jurisdiction to hear the merits of this moot dispute.

II
In its interpretation of Missouri's ""determination of viability"" provision, Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.029 (1986), see ante, at 513-521, the plurality has proceeded in a manner unnecessary to deciding the question at hand. I agree with the plurality that it was plain error for the Court of Appeals to interpret the second sentence of § 188.029 as meaning that ""doctors must perform tests to find gestational age, fetal weight and lung maturity."" 851 F.2d 1071, 1075, n. 5 (CA8 1988) (emphasis in original). When read together with the first sentence of § 188.029  which requires a physician to ""determine if the unborn child is viable by using and exercising that degree of care, skill, and proficiency commonly exercised by the ordinary skillful, careful, and prudent physician engaged in similar practice under the same or similar conditions""  it would be contradictory nonsense to read the second sentence as requiring a physician to perform viability examinations and tests in situations where it would be careless and imprudent to do so. The plurality is quite correct: ""the viability-testing provision makes sense only if the second sentence is read to require only those tests that are useful to making subsidiary findings as to viability,"" ante, at 514, and, I would add, only those examinations and tests that it would not be imprudent or careless to perform in the particular medical situation before the physician.
Unlike the plurality, I do not understand these viability testing requirements to conflict with any of the Court's past decisions concerning state regulation of abortion. Therefore, there is no necessity to accept the State's invitation to reexamine the constitutional validity of Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973). Where there is no need to decide a constitutional question, it is a venerable principle of this Court's adjudicatory processes not to do so, for ""[t]he Court will not `anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the *526 necessity of deciding it.' "" Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 346 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring), quoting Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S. S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113 U.S. 33, 39 (1885). Neither will it generally ""formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied."" 297 U.S., at 347. Quite simply, ""[i]t is not the habit of the court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case."" Burton v. United States, 196 U.S. 283, 295 (1905). The Court today has accepted the State's every interpretation of its abortion statute and has upheld, under our existing precedents, every provision of that statute which is properly before us. Precisely for this reason reconsideration of Roe falls not into any ""good-cause exception"" to this ""fundamental rule of judicial restraint . . . ."" Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C., 467 U.S. 138, 157 (1984). See post, at 532-533 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). When the constitutional invalidity of a State's abortion statute actually turns on the constitutional validity of Roe v. Wade, there will be time enough to reexamine Roe. And to do so carefully.
In assessing § 188.029 it is especially important to recognize that appellees did not appeal the District Court's ruling that the first sentence of § 188.029 is constitutional. 662 F. Supp. 407, 420-422 (WD Mo. 1987). There is, accordingly, no dispute between the parties before us over the constitutionality of the ""presumption of viability at 20 weeks,"" ante, at 515, created by the first sentence of § 188.029. If anything might arguably conflict with the Court's previous decisions concerning the determination of viability, I would think it is the introduction of this presumption. The plurality, see ante, at 515, refers to a passage from Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 64 (1976): ""The time when viability is achieved may vary with each pregnancy, and the determination of whether a particular fetus is viable is, and must *527 be, a matter for the judgment of the responsible attending physician."" The 20-week presumption of viability in the first sentence of § 188.029, it could be argued (though, I would think, unsuccessfully), restricts ""the judgment of the responsible attending physician,"" by imposing on that physician the burden of overcoming the presumption. This presumption may be a ""superimpos[ition] [of] state regulation on the medical determination whether a particular fetus is viable,"" ante, at 517, but, if so, it is a restriction on the physician's judgment that is not before us. As the plurality properly interprets the second sentence of § 188.029, it does nothing more than delineate means by which the unchallenged 20-week presumption of viability may be overcome if those means are useful in doing so and can be prudently employed. Contrary to the plurality's suggestion, see ante, at 517, the District Court did not think the second sentence of § 188.029 unconstitutional for this reason. Rather, both the District Court and the Court of Appeals thought the second sentence to be unconstitutional precisely because they interpreted that sentence to impose state regulation on the determination of viability that it does not impose.
Appellees suggest that the interpretation of § 188.029 urged by the State may ""virtually eliminat[e] the constitutional issue in this case."" Brief for Appellees 30. Appellees therefore propose that we should abstain from deciding that provision's constitutionality ""in order to allow the state courts to render the saving construction the State has proposed."" Ibid. Where the lower court has so clearly fallen into error I do not think abstention is necessary or prudent. Accordingly, I consider the constitutionality of the second sentence of § 188.029, as interpreted by the State, to determine whether the constitutional issue is actually eliminated.
I do not think the second sentence of § 188.029, as interpreted by the Court, imposes a degree of state regulation on the medical determination of viability that in any way conflicts with prior decisions of this Court. As the plurality *528 recognizes, the requirement that, where not imprudent, physicians perform examinations and tests useful to making subsidiary findings to determine viability ""promot[es] the State's interest in potential human life rather than in maternal health."" Ante, at 515. No decision of this Court has held that the State may not directly promote its interest in potential life when viability is possible. Quite the contrary. In Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747 (1986), the Court considered a constitutional challenge to a Pennsylvania statute requiring that a second physician be present during an abortion performed ""when viability is possible."" Id., at 769-770. For guidance, the Court looked to the earlier decision in Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U.S. 476 (1983), upholding a Missouri statute requiring the presence of a second physician during an abortion performed after viability. Id., at 482-486 (opinion of Powell, J.); id., at 505 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). The Thornburgh majority struck down the Pennsylvania statute merely because the statute had no exception for emergency situations and not because it found a constitutional difference between the State's promotion of its interest in potential life when viability is possible and when viability is certain. 476 U.S., at 770-771. Despite the clear recognition by the Thornburgh majority that the Pennsylvania and Missouri statutes differed in this respect, there is no hint in the opinion of the Thornburgh Court that the State's interest in potential life differs depending on whether it seeks to further that interest postviability or when viability is possible. Thus, all nine Members of the Thornburgh Court appear to have agreed that it is not constitutionally impermissible for the State to enact regulations designed to protect the State's interest in potential life when viability is possible. See id., at 811 (WHITE, J., dissenting); id., at 832 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). That is exactly what Missouri has done in § 188.029.
*529 Similarly, the basis for reliance by the District Court and the Court of Appeals below on Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379 (1979), disappears when § 188.029 is properly interpreted. In Colautti, the Court observed:
""Because this point [of viability] may differ with each pregnancy, neither the legislature nor the courts may proclaim one of the elements entering into the ascertainment of viability  be it weeks of gestation or fetal weight or any other single factor  as the determinant of when the State has a compelling interest in the life or health of the fetus. Viability is the critical point."" Id., at 388-389.
The courts below, on the interpretation of § 188.029 rejected here, found the second sentence of that provision at odds with this passage from Colautti. See 851 F.2d, at 1074; 662 F. Supp., at 423. On this Court's interpretation of § 188.029 it is clear that Missouri has not substituted any of the ""elements entering into the ascertainment of viability"" as ""the determinant of when the State has a compelling interest in the life or health of the fetus."" All the second sentence of § 188.029 does is to require, when not imprudent, the performance of ""those tests that are useful to making subsidiary findings as to viability."" Ante, at 514 (emphasis added). Thus, consistent with Colautti, viability remains the ""critical point"" under § 188.029.
Finally, and rather halfheartedly, the plurality suggests that the marginal increase in the cost of an abortion created by Missouri's viability testing provision may make § 188.029, even as interpreted, suspect under this Court's decision in Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416, 434-439 (1983), striking down a second-trimester hospitalization requirement. See ante, at 517. I dissented from the Court's opinion in Akron because it was my view that, even apart from Roe's trimester framework which I continue to consider problematic, see Thornburgh, supra, at *530 828 (dissenting opinion), the Akron majority had distorted and misapplied its own standard for evaluating state regulation of abortion which the Court had applied with fair consistency in the past: that, previability, ""a regulation imposed on a lawful abortion is not unconstitutional unless it unduly burdens the right to seek an abortion."" Akron, supra, at 453 (dissenting opinion) (internal quotations omitted).
It is clear to me that requiring the performance of examinations and tests useful to determining whether a fetus is viable, when viability is possible, and when it would not be medically imprudent to do so, does not impose an undue burden on a woman's abortion decision. On this ground alone I would reject the suggestion that § 188.029 as interpreted is unconstitutional. More to the point, however, just as I see no conflict between § 188.029 and Colautti or any decision of this Court concerning a State's ability to give effect to its interest in potential life, I see no conflict between § 188.029 and the Court's opinion in Akron. The second-trimester hospitalization requirement struck down in Akron imposed, in the majority's view, ""a heavy, and unnecessary, burden,"" 462 U.S., at 438, more than doubling the cost of ""women's access to a relatively inexpensive, otherwise accessible, and safe abortion procedure."" Ibid.; see also id., at 434. By contrast, the cost of examinations and tests that could usefully and prudently be performed when a woman is 20-24 weeks pregnant to determine whether the fetus is viable would only marginally, if at all, increase the cost of an abortion. See Brief for American Association of Prolife Obstetricians and Gynecologists et al. as Amici Curiae 3 (""At twenty weeks gestation, an ultrasound examination to determine gestational age is standard medical practice. It is routinely provided by the plaintiff clinics. An ultrasound examination can effectively provide all three designated findings of sec. 188.029""); id., at 22 (""A finding of fetal weight can be obtained from the same ultrasound test used to determine gestational age""); id., at 25 (""There are a number of different *531 methods in standard medical practice to determine fetal lung maturity at twenty or more weeks gestation. The most simple and most obvious is by inference. It is well known that fetal lungs do not mature until 33-34 weeks gestation. . . . If an assessment of the gestational age indicates that the child is less than thirty-three weeks, a general finding can be made that the fetal lungs are not mature. This finding can then be used by the physician in making his determination of viability under section 188.029""); cf. Brief for American Medical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 42 (no suggestion that fetal weight and gestational age cannot be determined from the same sonogram); id., at 43 (another clinical test for gestational age and, by inference, fetal weight and lung maturity, is an accurate report of the last menstrual period), citing Smith, Frey, & Johnson, Assessing Gestational Age, 33 Am. Fam. Physician 215, 219-220 (1986).
Moreover, the examinations and tests required by § 188.029 are to be performed when viability is possible. This feature of § 188.029 distinguishes it from the second-trimester hospitalization requirement struck down by the Akron majority. As the Court recognized in Thornburgh, the State's compelling interest in potential life postviability renders its interest in determining the critical point of viability equally compelling. See supra, at 527-528. Under the Court's precedents, the same cannot be said for the Akron second-trimester hospitalization requirement. As I understand the Court's opinion in Akron, therefore, the plurality's suggestion today that Akron casts doubt on the validity of § 188.029, even as the Court has interpreted it, is without foundation and cannot provide a basis for reevaluating Roe. Accordingly, because the Court of Appeals misinterpreted § 188.029, and because, properly interpreted, § 188.029 is not inconsistent with any of this Court's prior precedents, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.
In sum, I concur in Parts I, II-A, II-B, and II-C of the Court's opinion and concur in the judgment as to Part II-D.
*532 JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I join Parts I, II-A, II-B, and II-C of the opinion of the Court. As to Part II-D, I share JUSTICE BLACKMUN'S view, post, at 556, that it effectively would overrule Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973). I think that should be done, but would do it more explicitly. Since today we contrive to avoid doing it, and indeed to avoid almost any decision of national import, I need not set forth my reasons, some of which have been well recited in dissents of my colleagues in other cases. See, e. g., Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 786-797 (1986) (WHITE, J., dissenting); Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416, 453-459 (1983) (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting); Roe v. Wade, supra, at 172-178 (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting); Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 221-223 (1973) (WHITE, J., dissenting).
The outcome of today's case will doubtless be heralded as a triumph of judicial statesmanship. It is not that, unless it is statesmanlike needlessly to prolong this Court's self-awarded sovereignty over a field where it has little proper business since the answers to most of the cruel questions posed are political and not juridical  a sovereignty which therefore quite properly, but to the great damage of the Court, makes it the object of the sort of organized public pressure that political institutions in a democracy ought to receive.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S assertion, ante, at 526, that a "" `fundamental rule of judicial restraint' "" requires us to avoid reconsidering Roe, cannot be taken seriously. By finessing Roe we do not, as she suggests, ibid., adhere to the strict and venerable rule that we should avoid "" `decid[ing] questions of a constitutional nature.' "" We have not disposed of this case on some statutory or procedural ground, but have decided, and could not avoid deciding, whether the Missouri statute meets the requirements of the United States Constitution. *533 The only choice available is whether, in deciding that constitutional question, we should use Roe v. Wade as the benchmark, or something else. What is involved, therefore, is not the rule of avoiding constitutional issues where possible, but the quite separate principle that we will not "" `formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.' "" Ante, at 526. The latter is a sound general principle, but one often departed from when good reason exists. Just this Term, for example, in an opinion authored by JUSTICE O'CONNOR, despite the fact that we had already held a racially based set-aside unconstitutional because unsupported by evidence of identified discrimination, which was all that was needed to decide the case, we went on to outline the criteria for properly tailoring race-based remedies in cases where such evidence is present. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 506-508 (1989). Also this Term, in an opinion joined by JUSTICE O'CONNOR, we announced the constitutional rule that deprivation of the right to confer with counsel during trial violates the Sixth Amendment even if no prejudice can be shown, despite our finding that there had been no such deprivation on the facts before us  which was all that was needed to decide that case. Perry v. Leeke, 488 U.S. 272, 278-280 (1989); see id., at 285 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part). I have not identified with certainty the first instance of our deciding a case on broader constitutional grounds than absolutely necessary, but it is assuredly no later than Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), where we held that mandamus could constitutionally issue against the Secretary of State, although that was unnecessary given our holding that the law authorizing issuance of the mandamus by this Court was unconstitutional.
The Court has often spoken more broadly than needed in precisely the fashion at issue here, announcing a new rule of constitutional law when it could have reached the identical result by applying the rule thereby displaced. To describe *534 two recent opinions that JUSTICE O'CONNOR joined: In Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327 (1986), we overruled our prior holding that a ""deprivation"" of liberty or property could occur through negligent governmental acts, ignoring the availability of the alternative constitutional ground that, even if a deprivation had occurred, the State's postdeprivation remedies satisfied due process, see id., at 340-343 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). In Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213 (1983), we replaced the pre-existing ""two-pronged"" constitutional test for probable cause with a totality-of-the-circumstances approach, ignoring the concurrence's argument that the same outcome could have been reached under the old test, see id., at 267-272 (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment). It is rare, of course, that the Court goes out of its way to acknowledge that its judgment could have been reached under the old constitutional rule, making its adoption of the new one unnecessary to the decision, but even such explicit acknowledgment is not unheard of. See Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U.S. 609 (1981); Perez v. Campbell, 402 U.S. 637 (1971). For a sampling of other cases where the availability of a narrower, well-established ground is simply ignored in the Court's opinion adopting a new constitutional rule, though pointed out in separate opinions of some Justices, see Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U.S. 276 (1976); Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400 (1965); and Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961). It would be wrong, in any decision, to ignore the reality that our policy not to ""formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts"" has a frequently applied good-cause exception. But it seems particularly perverse to convert the policy into an absolute in the present case, in order to place beyond reach the inexpressibly ""broader-than-was-required-by-the-precise-facts"" structure established by Roe v. Wade.
The real question, then, is whether there are valid reasons to go beyond the most stingy possible holding today. It seems to me there are not only valid but compelling ones. *535 Ordinarily, speaking no more broadly than is absolutely required avoids throwing settled law into confusion; doing so today preserves a chaos that is evident to anyone who can read and count. Alone sufficient to justify a broad holding is the fact that our retaining control, through Roe, of what I believe to be, and many of our citizens recognize to be, a political issue, continuously distorts the public perception of the role of this Court. We can now look forward to at least another Term with carts full of mail from the public, and streets full of demonstrators, urging us  their unelected and life-tenured judges who have been awarded those extraordinary, undemocratic characteristics precisely in order that we might follow the law despite the popular will  to follow the popular will. Indeed, I expect we can look forward to even more of that than before, given our indecisive decision today. And if these reasons for taking the unexceptional course of reaching a broader holding are not enough, then consider the nature of the constitutional question we avoid: In most cases, we do no harm by not speaking more broadly than the decision requires. Anyone affected by the conduct that the avoided holding would have prohibited will be able to challenge it himself and have his day in court to make the argument. Not so with respect to the harm that many States believed, pre-Roe, and many may continue to believe, is caused by largely unrestricted abortion. That will continue to occur if the States have the constitutional power to prohibit it, and would do so, but we skillfully avoid telling them so. Perhaps those abortions cannot constitutionally be proscribed. That is surely an arguable question, the question that reconsideration of Roe v. Wade entails. But what is not at all arguable, it seems to me, is that we should decide now and not insist that we be run into a corner before we grudgingly yield up our judgment. The only sound reason for the latter course is to prevent a change in the law  but to think that desirable begs the question to be decided.
*536 It was an arguable question today whether § 188.029 of the Missouri law contravened this Court's understanding of Roe v. Wade,[*] and I would have examined Roe rather than *537 examining the contravention. Given the Court's newly contracted abstemiousness, what will it take, one must wonder, to permit us to reach that fundamental question? The result of our vote today is that we will not reconsider that prior opinion, even if most of the Justices think it is wrong, unless we have before us a statute that in fact contradicts it  and even then (under our newly discovered ""no-broader-than-necessary"" requirement) only minor problematical aspects of Roe will be reconsidered, unless one expects state legislatures to adopt provisions whose compliance with Roe cannot even be argued with a straight face. It thus appears that the mansion of constitutionalized abortion law, constructed overnight in Roe v. Wade, must be disassembled doorjamb by doorjamb, and never entirely brought down, no matter how wrong it may be.
Of the four courses we might have chosen today  to reaffirm Roe, to overrule it explicitly, to overrule it sub silentio, or to avoid the question  the last is the least responsible. On the question of the constitutionality of § 188.029, I concur in the judgment of the Court and strongly dissent from the manner in which it has been reached.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR would nevertheless uphold the law because it ""does not impose an undue burden on a woman's abortion decision."" Ante, at 530. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the required tests impose only a marginal cost on the abortion procedure, far less of an increase than the cost-doubling hospitalization requirement invalidated in Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416 (1983). See ante, at 530-531. The fact that the challenged regulation is less costly than what we struck down in Akron tells us only that we cannot decide the present case on the basis of that earlier decision. It does not tell us whether the present requirement is an ""undue burden,"" and I know of no basis for determining that this particular burden (or any other for that matter) is ""due."" One could with equal justification conclude that it is not. To avoid the question of Roe v. Wade's validity, with the attendant costs that this will have for the Court and for the principles of self-governance, on the basis of a standard that offers ""no guide but the Court's own discretion,"" Baldwin v. Missouri, 281 U.S. 586, 595 (1930) (Holmes, J., dissenting), merely adds to the irrationality of what we do today.
Similarly irrational is the new concept that JUSTICE O'CONNOR introduces into the law in order to achieve her result, the notion of a State's ""interest in potential life when viability is possible."" Ante, at 528. Since ""viability"" means the mere possibility (not the certainty) of survivability outside the womb, ""possible viability"" must mean the possibility of a possibility of survivability outside the womb. Perhaps our next opinion will expand the third trimester into the second even further, by approving state action designed to take account of ""the chance of possible viability.""
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE MARSHALL join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
Today, Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and the fundamental constitutional right of women to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy, survive but are not secure. Although the Court extricates itself from this case without making a single, even incremental, change in the law of abortion, the plurality and JUSTICE SCALIA would overrule Roe (the first silently, the other explicitly) and would return to the States *538 virtually unfettered authority to control the quintessentially intimate, personal, and life-directing decision whether to carry a fetus to term. Although today, no less than yesterday, the Constitution and the decisions of this Court prohibit a State from enacting laws that inhibit women from the meaningful exercise of that right, a plurality of this Court implicitly invites every state legislature to enact more and more restrictive abortion regulations in order to provoke more and more test cases, in the hope that sometime down the line the Court will return the law of procreative freedom to the severe limitations that generally prevailed in this country before January 22, 1973. Never in my memory has a plurality announced a judgment of this Court that so foments disregard for the law and for our standing decisions.
Nor in my memory has a plurality gone about its business in such a deceptive fashion. At every level of its review, from its effort to read the real meaning out of the Missouri statute, to its intended evisceration of precedents and its deafening silence about the constitutional protections that it would jettison, the plurality obscures the portent of its analysis. With feigned restraint, the plurality announces that its analysis leaves Roe ""undisturbed,"" albeit ""modif[ied] and narrow[ed]."" Ante, at 521. But this disclaimer is totally meaningless. The plurality opinion is filled with winks, and nods, and knowing glances to those who would do away with Roe explicitly, but turns a stone face to anyone in search of what the plurality conceives as the scope of a woman's right under the Due Process Clause to terminate a pregnancy free from the coercive and brooding influence of the State. The simple truth is that Roe would not survive the plurality's analysis, and that the plurality provides no substitute for Roe's protective umbrella.
I fear for the future. I fear for the liberty and equality of the millions of women who have lived and come of age in the 16 years since Roe was decided. I fear for the integrity of, and public esteem for, this Court.
I dissent.


*539 I
THE CHIEF JUSTICE parades through the four challenged sections of the Missouri statute seriatim. I shall not do this, but shall relegate most of my comments as to those sections to the margin.[1] Although I disagree with the Court's consideration *540 of §§ 1.205, 188.210, and 188.215, and am especially disturbed by its misapplication of our past decisions in upholding Missouri's ban on the performance of abortions at *541 ""public facilities,"" its discussion of these provisions is merely prologue to the plurality's consideration of the statute's viability-testing requirement, § 188.029  the only section of the Missouri statute that the plurality construes as implicating Roe itself. There, tucked away at the end of its opinion, the plurality suggests a radical reversal of the law of abortion; and there, primarily, I direct my attention.
In the plurality's view, the viability-testing provision imposes a burden on second-trimester abortions as a way of furthering the State's interest in protecting the potential life of the fetus. Since under the Roe framework, the State may not fully regulate abortion in the interest of potential life (as opposed to maternal health) until the third trimester, the plurality finds it necessary, in order to save the Missouri testing provision, to throw out Roe's trimester framework. Ante, at 518-520. In flat contradiction to Roe, 410 U. S., at 163, the plurality concludes that the State's interest in potential life is compelling before viability, and upholds the testing provision *542 because it ""permissibly furthers"" that state interest. Ante, at 519.

A
At the outset, I note that in its haste to limit abortion rights, the plurality compounds the errors of its analysis by needlessly reaching out to address constitutional questions that are not actually presented. The conflict between § 188.029 and Roe's trimester framework, which purportedly drives the plurality to reconsider our past decisions, is a contrived conflict: the product of an aggressive misreading of the viability-testing requirement and a needlessly wooden application of the Roe framework.
The plurality's reading of § 188.029 is irreconcilable with the plain language of the statute and is in derogation of this Court's settled view that ""district courts and courts of appeals are better schooled in and more able to interpret the laws of their respective States.' "" Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 482 (1988), quoting Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 499-500 (1985). Abruptly setting aside the construction of § 188.029 adopted by both the District Court and Court of Appeals as ""plain error,"" the plurality reads the viability-testing provision as requiring only that before a physician may perform an abortion on a woman whom he believes to be carrying a fetus of 20 or more weeks gestational age, the doctor must determine whether the fetus is viable and, as part of that exercise, must, to the extent feasible and consistent with sound medical practice, conduct tests necessary to make findings of gestational age, weight, and lung maturity. Ante, at 514-517. But the plurality's reading of the provision, according to which the statute requires the physician to perform tests only in order to determine viability, ignores the statutory language explicitly directing that ""the physician shall perform or cause to be performed such medical examinations and tests as are necessary to make a finding of the gestational age, weight, and lung maturity of the unborn child and shall enter such findings"" in the mother's medical record. § 188.029 (emphasis added). The *543 statute's plain language requires the physician to undertake whatever tests are necessary to determine gestational age, weight, and lung maturity, regardless of whether these tests are necessary to a finding of viability, and regardless of whether the tests subject the pregnant woman or the fetus to additional health risks or add substantially to the cost of an abortion.[2]
Had the plurality read the statute as written, it would have had no cause to reconsider the Roe framework. As properly construed, the viability-testing provision does not pass constitutional muster under even a rational-basis standard, the least restrictive level of review applied by this Court. See Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483 (1955). By mandating tests to determine fetal weight and lung maturity for every fetus thought to be more than 20 weeks gestational age, the statute requires physicians to undertake procedures, such as amniocentesis, that, in the situation presented, have no medical justification, impose significant additional health risks on both the pregnant woman and the fetus, and bear no rational relation to the State's interest in protecting fetal life.[3] As written, § 188.029 is an arbitrary imposition of discomfort, risk, and expense, furthering no discernible interest except to make the procurement of an abortion as arduous and difficult as possible. Thus, were it not for *544 the plurality's tortured effort to avoid the plain import of § 188.029, it could have struck down the testing provision as patently irrational irrespective of the Roe framework.[4]
The plurality eschews this straightforward resolution, in the hope of precipitating a constitutional crisis. Far from avoiding constitutional difficulty, the plurality attempts to engineer a dramatic retrenchment in our jurisprudence by exaggerating the conflict between its untenable construction of § 188.029 and the Roe trimester framework.
No one contests that under the Roe framework the State, in order to promote its interest in potential human life, may regulate and even proscribe nontherapeutic abortions once the fetus becomes viable. Roe, 410 U. S., at 164-165. If, as the plurality appears to hold, the testing provision simply requires a physician to use appropriate and medically sound tests to determine whether the fetus is actually viable when the estimated gestational age is greater than 20 weeks (and therefore within what the District Court found to be the margin of error for viability, ante, at 515-516), then I see little or no conflict with Roe.[5] Nothing in Roe, or any of its progeny, holds that a State may not effectuate its compelling interest in the potential life of a viable fetus by seeking to ensure that no viable fetus is mistakenly aborted because of the inherent lack of precision in estimates of gestational age. A requirement that a physician make a finding of viability, one way or *545 the other, for every fetus that falls within the range of possible viability does no more than preserve the State's recognized authority. Although, as the plurality correctly points out, such a testing requirement would have the effect of imposing additional costs on second-trimester abortions where the tests indicated that the fetus was not viable, these costs would be merely incidental to, and a necessary accommodation of, the State's unquestioned right to prohibit nontherapeutic abortions after the point of viability. In short, the testing provision, as construed by the plurality, is consistent with the Roe framework and could be upheld effortlessly under current doctrine.[6]
How ironic it is, then, and disingenuous, that the plurality scolds the Court of Appeals for adopting a construction of the statute that fails to avoid constitutional difficulties. Ante, at *546 514, 515. By distorting the statute, the plurality manages to avoid invalidating the testing provision on what should have been noncontroversial constitutional grounds; having done so, however, the plurality rushes headlong into a much deeper constitutional thicket, brushing past an obvious basis for upholding § 188.029 in search of a pretext for scuttling the trimester framework. Evidently, from the plurality's perspective, the real problem with the Court of Appeals' construction of § 188.029 is not that it raised a constitutional difficulty, but that it raised the wrong constitutional difficulty  one not implicating Roe. The plurality has remedied that, traditional canons of construction and judicial forbearance notwithstanding.

B
Having set up the conflict between § 188.029 and the Roe trimester framework, the plurality summarily discards Roe's analytic core as "" `unsound in principle and unworkable in practice.' "" Ante, at 518, quoting Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U.S. 528, 546 (1985). This is so, the plurality claims, because the key elements of the framework do not appear in the text of the Constitution, because the framework more closely resembles a regulatory code than a body of constitutional doctrine, and because under the framework the State's interest in potential human life is considered compelling only after viability, when, in fact, that interest is equally compelling throughout pregnancy. Ante, at 519-520. The plurality does not bother to explain these alleged flaws in Roe. Bald assertion masquerades as reasoning. The object, quite clearly, is not to persuade, but to prevail.

1
The plurality opinion is far more remarkable for the arguments that it does not advance than for those that it does. The plurality does not even mention, much less join, the true jurisprudential debate underlying this case: whether the Constitution includes an ""unenumerated"" general right to *547 privacy as recognized in many of our decisions, most notably Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), and Roe, and, more specifically, whether, and to what extent, such a right to privacy extends to matters of childbearing and family life, including abortion. See, e. g., Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972) (contraception); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967) (marriage); Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535 (1942) (procreation); Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925) (childrearing).[7] These are questions of unsurpassed significance in this Court's interpretation of the Constitution, and mark the battleground upon which this case was fought, by the parties, by the United States as amicus on behalf of petitioners, and by an unprecedented number of amici. On these grounds, abandoned by the plurality, the Court should decide this case.
But rather than arguing that the text of the Constitution makes no mention of the right to privacy, the plurality complains that the critical elements of the Roe framework  trimesters *548 and viability  do not appear in the Constitution and are, therefore, somehow inconsistent with a Constitution cast in general terms. Ante, at 518-519. Were this a true concern, we would have to abandon most of our constitutional jurisprudence. As the plurality well knows, or should know, the ""critical elements"" of countless constitutional doctrines nowhere appear in the Constitution's text. The Constitution makes no mention, for example, of the First Amendment's ""actual malice"" standard for proving certain libels, see New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964), or of the standard for determining when speech is obscene. See Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973). Similarly, the Constitution makes no mention of the rational-basis test, or the specific verbal formulations of intermediate and strict scrutiny by which this Court evaluates claims under the Equal Protection Clause. The reason is simple. Like the Roe framework, these tests or standards are not, and do not purport to be, rights protected by the Constitution. Rather, they are judge-made methods for evaluating and measuring the strength and scope of constitutional rights or for balancing the constitutional rights of individuals against the competing interests of government.
With respect to the Roe framework, the general constitutional principle, indeed the fundamental constitutional right, for which it was developed is the right to privacy, see, e. g., Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), a species of ""liberty"" protected by the Due Process Clause, which under our past decisions safeguards the right of women to exercise some control over their own role in procreation. As we recently reaffirmed in Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747 (1986), few decisions are ""more basic to individual dignity and autonomy"" or more appropriate to that ""certain private sphere of individual liberty"" that the Constitution reserves from the intrusive reach of government than the right to make the uniquely personal, intimate, and self-defining decision whether to end *549 a pregnancy. Id., at 772. It is this general principle, the "" `moral fact that a person belongs to himself and not others nor to society as a whole,' "" id., at 777, n. 5 (STEVENS, J., concurring), quoting Fried, Correspondence, 6 Phil. & Pub. Aff. 288-289 (1977), that is found in the Constitution. See Roe, 410 U. S., at 152-153. The trimester framework simply defines and limits that right to privacy in the abortion context to accommodate, not destroy, a State's legitimate interest in protecting the health of pregnant women and in preserving potential human life. Id., at 154-162. Fashioning such accommodations between individual rights and the legitimate interests of government, establishing benchmarks and standards with which to evaluate the competing claims of individuals and government, lies at the very heart of constitutional adjudication. To the extent that the trimester framework is useful in this enterprise, it is not only consistent with constitutional interpretation, but necessary to the wise and just exercise of this Court's paramount authority to define the scope of constitutional rights.

2
The plurality next alleges that the result of the trimester framework has ""been a web of legal rules that have become increasingly intricate, resembling a code of regulations rather than a body of constitutional doctrine."" Ante, at 518. Again, if this were a true and genuine concern, we would have to abandon vast areas of our constitutional jurisprudence. The plurality complains that under the trimester framework the Court has distinguished between a city ordinance requiring that second-trimester abortions be performed in clinics and a state law requiring that these abortions be performed in hospitals, or between laws requiring that certain information be furnished to a woman by a physician or his assistant and those requiring that such information be furnished by the physician exclusively. Ante, at 518, n. 15, citing Simopoulos v. Virginia, 462 U.S. 506 (1983), *550 and Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416 (1983). Are these distinctions any finer, or more ""regulatory,"" than the distinctions we have often drawn in our First Amendment jurisprudence, where, for example, we have held that a ""release time"" program permitting public-school students to leave school grounds during school hours to receive religious instruction does not violate the Establishment Clause, even though a release-time program permitting religious instruction on school grounds does violate the Clause? Compare Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306 (1952), with Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Education of School Dist. No. 71, Champaign County, 333 U.S. 203 (1948). Our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence recognizes factual distinctions no less intricate. Just this Term, for example, we held that while an aerial observation from a helicopter hovering at 400 feet does not violate any reasonable expectation of privacy, such an expectation of privacy would be violated by a helicopter observation from an unusually low altitude. Florida v. Riley, 488 U.S. 445, 451 (1989) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment). Similarly, in a Sixth Amendment case, the Court held that although an overnight ban on attorney-client communication violated the constitutionally guaranteed right to counsel, Geders v. United States, 425 U.S. 80 (1976), that right was not violated when a trial judge separated a defendant from his lawyer during a 15-minute recess after the defendant's direct testimony. Perry v. Leeke, 488 U.S. 272 (1989).
That numerous constitutional doctrines result in narrow differentiations between similar circumstances does not mean that this Court has abandoned adjudication in favor of regulation. Rather, these careful distinctions reflect the process of constitutional adjudication itself, which is often highly fact specific, requiring such determinations as whether state laws are ""unduly burdensome"" or ""reasonable"" or bear a ""rational"" or ""necessary"" relation to asserted state interests. In a recent due process case, THE CHIEF JUSTICE wrote for the *551 Court: ""[M]any branches of the law abound in nice distinctions that may be troublesome but have been thought nonetheless necessary: `I do not think we need trouble ourselves with the thought that my view depends upon differences of degree. The whole law does so as soon as it is civilized.' "" Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 334 (1986), quoting LeRoy Fibre Co. v. Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co., 232 U.S. 340, 354 (1914) (Holmes, J., partially concurring).
These ""differences of degree"" fully account for our holdings in Simopoulos, supra, and Akron, supra. Those decisions rest on this Court's reasoned and accurate judgment that hospitalization and doctor-counseling requirements unduly burdened the right of women to terminate a pregnancy and were not rationally related to the State's asserted interest in the health of pregnant women, while Virginia's substantially less restrictive regulations were not unduly burdensome and did rationally serve the State's interest.[8] That the Court exercised its best judgment in evaluating these markedly different statutory schemes no more established the Court as an "" `ex officio medical board,' "" ante, at 519, quoting Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 99 (1976) (opinion of WHITE, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), than our decisions involving religion in the public schools establish the Court as a national school board, or our decisions concerning prison regulations establish the Court as *552 a bureau of prisons. See Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401 (1989) (adopting different standard of First Amendment review for incoming as opposed to outgoing prison mail). If, in delicate and complicated areas of constitutional law, our legal judgments ""have become increasingly intricate,"" ante, at 518, it is not, as the plurality contends, because we have overstepped our judicial role. Quite the opposite: the rules are intricate because we have remained conscientious in our duty to do justice carefully, especially when fundamental rights rise or fall with our decisions.

3
Finally, the plurality asserts that the trimester framework cannot stand because the State's interest in potential life is compelling throughout pregnancy, not merely after viability. Ante, at 519. The opinion contains not one word of rationale for its view of the State's interest. This ""it-is-so-because-we-say-so"" jurisprudence constitutes nothing other than an attempted exercise of brute force; reason, much less persuasion, has no place.
In answering the plurality's claim that the State's interest in the fetus is uniform and compelling throughout pregnancy, I cannot improve upon what JUSTICE STEVENS has written:
""I should think it obvious that the State's interest in the protection of an embryo  even if that interest is defined as `protecting those who will be citizens' . . .  increases progressively and dramatically as the organism's capacity to feel pain, to experience pleasure, to survive, and to react to its surroundings increases day by day. The development of a fetus  and pregnancy itself  are not static conditions, and the assertion that the government's interest is static simply ignores this reality. . . . [U]nless the religious view that a fetus is a `person' is adopted . . . there is a fundamental and well-recognized difference between a fetus and a human being; indeed, if *553 there is not such a difference, the permissibility of terminating the life of a fetus could scarcely be left to the will of the state legislatures. And if distinctions may be drawn between a fetus and a human being in terms of the state interest in their protection  even though the fetus represents one of `those who will be citizens'  it seems to me quite odd to argue that distinctions may not also be drawn between the state interest in protecting the freshly fertilized egg and the state interest in protecting the 9-month-gestated, fully sentient fetus on the eve of birth. Recognition of this distinction is supported not only by logic, but also by history and by our shared experiences."" Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 778-779 (footnote omitted).
See also Roe, 410 U. S., at 129-147.
For my own part, I remain convinced, as six other Members of this Court 16 years ago were convinced, that the Roe framework, and the viability standard in particular, fairly, sensibly, and effectively functions to safeguard the constitutional liberties of pregnant women while recognizing and accommodating the State's interest in potential human life. The viability line reflects the biological facts and truths of fetal development; it marks that threshold moment prior to which a fetus cannot survive separate from the woman and cannot reasonably and objectively be regarded as a subject of rights or interests distinct from, or paramount to, those of the pregnant woman. At the same time, the viability standard takes account of the undeniable fact that as the fetus evolves into its postnatal form, and as it loses its dependence on the uterine environment, the State's interest in the fetus' potential human life, and in fostering a regard for human life in general, becomes compelling. As a practical matter, because viability follows ""quickening""  the point at which a woman feels movement in her womb  and because viability occurs no earlier than 23 weeks gestational age, it establishes an easily applicable standard for regulating abortion while *554 providing a pregnant woman ample time to exercise her fundamental right with her responsible physician to terminate her pregnancy.[9] Although I have stated previously for a majority of this Court that ""[c]onstitutional rights do not always have easily ascertainable boundaries,"" to seek and establish those boundaries remains the special responsibility of this Court. Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 771. In Roe, we discharged that responsibility as logic and science compelled. The plurality today advances not one reasonable argument as to why our judgment in that case was wrong and should be abandoned.

C
Having contrived an opportunity to reconsider the Roe framework, and then having discarded that framework, the plurality finds the testing provision unobjectionable because it ""permissibly furthers the State's interest in protecting potential human life."" Ante, at 519-520. This newly minted *555 standard is circular and totally meaningless. Whether a challenged abortion regulation ""permissibly furthers"" a legitimate state interest is the question that courts must answer in abortion cases, not the standard for courts to apply. In keeping with the rest of its opinion, the plurality makes no attempt to explain or to justify its new standard, either in the abstract or as applied in this case. Nor could it. The ""permissibly furthers"" standard has no independent meaning, and consists of nothing other than what a majority of this Court may believe at any given moment in any given case. The plurality's novel test appears to be nothing more than a dressed-up version of rational-basis review, this Court's most lenient level of scrutiny. One thing is clear, however: were the plurality's ""permissibly furthers"" standard adopted by the Court, for all practical purposes, Roe would be overruled.[10]
The ""permissibly furthers"" standard completely disregards the irreducible minimum of Roe: the Court's recognition that a woman has a limited fundamental constitutional right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy. That right receives no meaningful recognition in the plurality's written opinion. Since, in the plurality's view, the State's interest in potential life is compelling as of the moment of conception, and is therefore served only if abortion is abolished, every hindrance to a woman's ability to obtain an abortion must be ""permissible."" Indeed, the more severe the hindrance, the more effectively (and permissibly) the State's interest would be furthered. A tax on abortions or a criminal prohibition would both satisfy the plurality's standard. So, for that *556 matter, would a requirement that a pregnant woman memorize and recite today's plurality opinion before seeking an abortion.
The plurality pretends that Roe survives, explaining that the facts of this case differ from those in Roe: here, Missouri has chosen to assert its interest in potential life only at the point of viability, whereas, in Roe, Texas had asserted that interest from the point of conception, criminalizing all abortions, except where the life of the mother was at stake. Ante, at 521. This, of course, is a distinction without a difference. The plurality repudiates every principle for which Roe stands; in good conscience, it cannot possibly believe that Roe lies ""undisturbed"" merely because this case does not call upon the Court to reconsider the Texas statute, or one like it. If the Constitution permits a State to enact any statute that reasonably furthers its interest in potential life, and if that interest arises as of conception, why would the Texas statute fail to pass muster? One suspects that the plurality agrees. It is impossible to read the plurality opinion and especially its final paragraph, without recognizing its implicit invitation to every State to enact more and more restrictive abortion laws, and to assert their interest in potential life as of the moment of conception. All these laws will satisfy the plurality's nonscrutiny, until sometime, a new regime of old dissenters and new appointees will declare what the plurality intends: that Roe is no longer good law.[11]


*557 D
Thus, ""not with a bang, but a whimper,"" the plurality discards a landmark case of the last generation, and casts into darkness the hopes and visions of every woman in this country who had come to believe that the Constitution guaranteed her the right to exercise some control over her unique ability to bear children. The plurality does so either oblivious or insensitive to the fact that millions of women, and their families, have ordered their lives around the right to reproductive choice, and that this right has become vital to the full participation of women in the economic and political walks of American life. The plurality would clear the way once again for government to force upon women the physical labor and specific and direct medical and psychological harms that may accompany carrying a fetus to term. The plurality would clear the way again for the State to conscript a woman's body and to force upon her a ""distressful life and future."" Roe, 410 U. S., at 153.
The result, as we know from experience, see Cates & Rochat, Illegal Abortions in the United States: 1972-1974, 8 Family Planning Perspectives 86, 92 (1976), would be that every year hundreds of thousands of women, in desperation, would defy the law, and place their health and safety in the unclean and unsympathetic hands of back-alley abortionists, or they would attempt to perform abortions upon themselves, *558 with disastrous results. Every year, many women, especially poor and minority women, would die or suffer debilitating physical trauma, all in the name of enforced morality or religious dictates or lack of compassion, as it may be.
Of the aspirations and settled understandings of American women, of the inevitable and brutal consequences of what it is doing, the tough-approach plurality utters not a word. This silence is callous. It is also profoundly destructive of this Court as an institution. To overturn a constitutional decision is a rare and grave undertaking. To overturn a constitutional decision that secured a fundamental personal liberty to millions of persons would be unprecedented in our 200 years of constitutional history. Although the doctrine of stare decisis applies with somewhat diminished force in constitutional cases generally, ante, at 518, even in ordinary constitutional cases ""any departure from . . . stare decisis demands special justification."" Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U.S. 203, 212 (1984). See also Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254, 266 (1986) (""[T]he careful observer will discern that any detours from the straight path of stare decisis in our past have occurred for articulable reasons, and only when the Court has felt obliged `to bring its opinions into agreement with experience and with facts newly ascertained,' "" quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 412 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)). This requirement of justification applies with unique force where, as here, the Court's abrogation of precedent would destroy people's firm belief, based on past decisions of this Court, that they possess an unabridgeable right to undertake certain conduct.[12]
*559 As discussed at perhaps too great length above, the plurality makes no serious attempt to carry ""the heavy burden of persuading . . . that changes in society or in the law dictate"" the abandonment of Roe and its numerous progeny, Vasquez, 474 U. S., at 266, much less the greater burden of explaining the abrogation of a fundamental personal freedom. Instead, the plurality pretends that it leaves Roe standing, and refuses even to discuss the real issue underlying this case: whether the Constitution includes an unenumerated right to privacy that encompasses a woman's right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy. To the extent that the plurality does criticize the Roe framework, these criticisms are pure ipse dixit.
This comes at a cost. The doctrine of stare decisis ""permits society to presume that bedrock principles are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of individuals, and thereby contributes to the integrity of our constitutional system of government, both in appearance and in fact."" 474 U.S., at 265-266. Today's decision involves the most politically divisive domestic legal issue of our time. By refusing to explain or to justify its proposed revolutionary revision in the law of abortion, and by refusing to abide not only by our precedents, but also by our canons for reconsidering those precedents, the plurality invites charges of cowardice and *560 illegitimacy to our door. I cannot say that these would be undeserved.

II
For today, at least, the law of abortion stands undisturbed. For today, the women of this Nation still retain the liberty to control their destinies. But the signs are evident and very ominous, and a chill wind blows.
JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
Having joined Part II-C of the Court's opinion, I shall not comment on § 188.205 of the Missouri statute. With respect to the challenged portions of §§ 188.210 and 188.215, I agree with JUSTICE BLACKMUN, ante, at 539-541, n. 1 (concurring in part and dissenting in part), that the record identifies a sufficient number of unconstitutional applications to support the Court of Appeals' judgment invalidating those provisions. The reasons why I would also affirm that court's invalidation of § 188.029, the viability testing provision, and §§ 1.205.1(1), (2) of the preamble,[1] require separate explanation.

I
It seems to me that in Part II-D of its opinion, the plurality strains to place a construction on § 188.029[2] that enables *561 it to conclude: ""[W]e would modify and narrow Roe and succeeding cases,"" ante, at 521. That statement is ill advised because there is no need to modify even slightly the holdings of prior cases in order to uphold § 188.029. For the most plausible nonliteral construction, as both JUSTICE BLACKMUN, ante, at 542-544 (concurring in part and dissenting in part), and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, ante, at 525-531 (concurring in part and concurring in judgment), have demonstrated, is constitutional and entirely consistent with our precedents.
I am unable to accept JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S construction of the second sentence in § 188.029, however, because I believe it is foreclosed by two controlling principles of statutory interpretation. First, it is our settled practice to accept ""the interpretation of state law in which the District Court and the Court of Appeals have concurred even if an examination of the state-law issue without such guidance might have justified a different conclusion."" Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341, 346 (1976).[3] Second, ""[t]he fact that a particular application of the clear terms of a statute might be unconstitutional does not provide us with a justification for ignoring the plain meaning of the statute."" Public Citizen v. Department of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 481 (1989) (KENNEDY, J., concurring *562 in judgment).[4] In this case, I agree with the Court of Appeals, 851 F.2d 1071, 1074-1075 (CA8 1988), and the District Court, 662 F. Supp. 407, 423 (WD Mo. 1987), that the meaning of the second sentence of § 188.029 is too plain to be ignored. The sentence twice uses the mandatory term ""shall,"" and contains no qualifying language. If it is implicitly limited to tests that are useful in determining viability, it adds nothing to the requirement imposed by the preceding sentence.
My interpretation of the plain language is supported by the structure of the statute as a whole, particularly the preamble, which ""finds"" that life ""begins at conception"" and further commands that state laws shall be construed to provide the maximum protection to ""the unborn child at every stage of development."" Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ 1.205.1(1), 1.205.2 (1986). I agree with the District Court that ""[o]bviously, the purpose of this law is to protect the potential life of the fetus, rather than to safeguard maternal health."" 662 F. Supp., at 420. A literal reading of the statute tends to accomplish that goal. Thus it is not ""incongruous,"" ante, at 515, to assume that the Missouri Legislature was trying to protect the potential human life of nonviable fetuses by making the abortion decision more costly.[5] On the contrary, I am satisfied that the Court of Appeals, as well as the District Court, correctly concluded that the Missouri Legislature meant exactly what it said in the second sentence of § 188.029. I am also satisfied, *563 for the reasons stated by JUSTICE BLACKMUN, that the testing provision is manifestly unconstitutional under Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483 (1955), ""irrespective of the Roe [v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973),] framework."" Ante, at 544 (concurring in part and dissenting in part).

II
The Missouri statute defines ""conception"" as ""the fertilization of the ovum of a female by a sperm of a male,"" Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.015(3) (1986), even though standard medical texts equate ""conception"" with implantation in the uterus, occurring about six days after fertilization.[6] Missouri's declaration therefore implies regulation not only of previability abortions, but also of common forms of contraception such as the IUD and the morning-after pill.[7] Because the preamble, read in context, threatens serious encroachments upon the liberty of the pregnant woman and the health professional, I am persuaded that these plaintiffs, appellees before us, have *564 standing to challenge its constitutionality. Accord, 851 F.2d, at 1075-1076.
To the extent that the Missouri statute interferes with contraceptive choices, I have no doubt that it is unconstitutional under the Court's holdings in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972); and Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U.S. 678 (1977). The place of Griswold in the mosaic of decisions defining a woman's liberty interest was accurately stated by Justice Stewart in his concurring opinion in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 167-170 (1973):
""[I]n Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, the Court held a Connecticut birth control law unconstitutional. In view of what had been so recently said in [Ferguson v.] Skrupa, [372 U.S. 726 (1963),] the Court's opinion in Griswold understandably did its best to avoid reliance on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as the ground for decision. Yet, the Connecticut law did not violate any provision of the Bill of Rights, nor any other specific provision of the Constitution. So it was clear to me then, and it is equally clear to me now, that the Griswold decision can be rationally understood only as a holding that the Connecticut statute substantively invaded the `liberty' that is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. As so understood, Griswold stands as one in a long line of pre-Skrupa cases decided under the doctrine of substantive due process, and I now accept it as such.

.....
""Several decisions of this Court make clear that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 [(1967)]; Griswold v. Connecticut, supra; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, [268 U.S. 510 (1925)]; Meyer v. Nebraska, [262 U.S. 390 (1923)]. See also *565 Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166 [(1944)]; Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541 [(1942)]. As recently as last Term, in Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 453 [(1972)], we recognized `the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.' That right necessarily includes the right of a woman to decide whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. `Certainly the interests of a woman in giving of her physical and emotional self during pregnancy and the interests that will be affected throughout her life by the birth and raising of a child are of a far greater degree of significance and personal intimacy than the right to send a child to private school protected in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925), or the right to teach a foreign language protected in Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923).' Abele v. Markle, 351 F. Supp. 224, 227 (Conn. 1972).
""Clearly, therefore, the Court today is correct in holding that the right asserted by Jane Roe is embraced within the personal liberty protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."" (Emphasis in original; footnotes omitted.)[8]
One might argue that the Griswold holding applies to devices ""preventing conception,"" 381 U.S., at 480  that is, fertilization  but not to those preventing implantation, and therefore, that Griswold does not protect a woman's choice to use an IUD or take a morning-after pill. There is unquestionably *566 a theological basis for such an argument,[9] just as there was unquestionably a theological basis for the Connecticut statute that the Court invalidated in Griswold. Our jurisprudence, however, has consistently required a secular basis for valid legislation. See, e. g., Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S. 39, 40 (1980) (per curiam).[10] Because I am not aware of any secular basis for differentiating between contraceptive procedures that are effective immediately before and those that are effective immediately after fertilization, I believe it inescapably follows that the preamble to the Missouri statute is invalid under Griswold and its progeny.
Indeed, I am persuaded that the absence of any secular purpose for the legislative declarations that life begins at conception and that conception occurs at fertilization makes the relevant portion of the preamble invalid under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution. This conclusion does not, and could not, rest on the fact that the statement happens to coincide with the tenets of certain religions, see McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 442 (1961); Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 319-320 (1980), or on the fact that the legislators who voted to enact it may have been motivated by religious considerations, see Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 253 (1976) (STEVENS, J., concurring). Rather, it rests on the fact that the preamble, an unequivocal endorsement of a religious tenet of some but by no means all Christian faiths,[11] serves no identifiable *567 secular purpose. That fact alone compels a conclusion that the statute violates the Establishment Clause.[12]Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 56 (1985).
My concern can best be explained by reference to the position on this issue that was widely accepted by the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church for many years. The position is summarized in a report, entitled ""Catholic Teaching On Abortion,"" prepared by the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress. It states in part:
""The disagreement over the status of the unformed as against the formed fetus was crucial for Christian teaching on the soul. It was widely held that the soul was not present until the formation of the fetus 40 or 80 days after conception, for males and females respectively. Thus, abortion of the `unformed' or `inanimate' fetus (from anima, soul) was something less than true homicide, rather a form of anticipatory or quasi-homicide. This view received its definitive treatment in St. Thomas Aquinas and became for a time the dominant interpretation in the Latin Church.

.....
""For St. Thomas, as for mediaeval Christendom generally, there is a lapse of time  approximately 40 to 80 days  after conception and before the soul's infusion. . . .
""For St. Thomas, `seed and what is not seed is determined by sensation and movement.' What is destroyed in abortion of the unformed fetus is seed, not man. This distinction received its most careful analysis in St. Thomas. It was the general belief of Christendom, reflected, *568 for example, in the Council of Trent (1545-1563), which restricted penalties for homicide to abortion of an animated fetus only."" C. Whittier, Catholic Teaching on Abortion: Its Origin and Later Development (1981), reprinted in Brief for Americans United for Separation of Church and State as Amicus Curiae 13a, 17a (quoting In octo libros politicorum 7.12, attributed to St. Thomas Aquinas).
If the views of St. Thomas were held as widely today as they were in the Middle Ages, and if a state legislature were to enact a statute prefaced with a ""finding"" that female life begins 80 days after conception and male life begins 40 days after conception, I have no doubt that this Court would promptly conclude that such an endorsement of a particular religious tenet is violative of the Establishment Clause.
In my opinion the difference between that hypothetical statute and Missouri's preamble reflects nothing more than a difference in theological doctrine. The preamble to the Missouri statute endorses the theological position that there is the same secular interest in preserving the life of a fetus during the first 40 or 80 days of pregnancy as there is after viability  indeed, after the time when the fetus has become a ""person"" with legal rights protected by the Constitution.[13] To sustain that position as a matter of law, I believe Missouri has the burden of identifying the secular interests that differentiate the first 40 days of pregnancy from the period immediately *569 before or after fertilization when, as Griswold and related cases establish, the Constitution allows the use of contraceptive procedures to prevent potential life from developing into full personhood. Focusing our attention on the first several weeks of pregnancy is especially appropriate because that is the period when the vast majority of abortions are actually performed.
As a secular matter, there is an obvious difference between the state interest in protecting the freshly fertilized egg and the state interest in protecting a 9-month-gestated, fully sentient fetus on the eve of birth. There can be no interest in protecting the newly fertilized egg from physical pain or mental anguish, because the capacity for such suffering does not yet exist; respecting a developed fetus, however, that interest is valid. In fact, if one prescinds the theological concept of ensoulment  or one accepts St. Thomas Aquinas' view that ensoulment does not occur for at least 40 days  a State has no greater secular interest in protecting the potential life of an embryo that is still ""seed"" than in protecting the potential life of a sperm or an unfertilized ovum.
There have been times in history when military and economic interests would have been served by an increase in population. No one argues today, however, that Missouri can assert a societal interest in increasing its population as its secular reason for fostering potential life. Indeed, our national policy, as reflected in legislation the Court upheld last Term, is to prevent the potential life that is produced by ""pregnancy and childbirth among unmarried adolescents."" Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 593 (1988); accord, id., at 602. If the secular analysis were based on a strict balancing of fiscal costs and benefits, the economic costs of unlimited childbearing would outweigh those of abortion. There is, of course, an important and unquestionably valid secular interest in ""protecting a young pregnant woman from the consequences of an incorrect decision,"" Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 102 (1976) *570 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Although that interest is served by a requirement that the woman receive medical and, in appropriate circumstances, parental, advice,[14] it does not justify the state legislature's official endorsement of the theological tenet embodied in §§ 1.205.1(1), (2).
The State's suggestion that the ""finding"" in the preamble to its abortion statute is, in effect, an amendment to its tort, property, and criminal laws is not persuasive. The Court of Appeals concluded that the preamble ""is simply an impermissible state adoption of a theory of when life begins to justify its abortion regulations."" 851 F.2d, at 1076. Supporting that construction is the state constitutional prohibition against legislative enactments pertaining to more than one subject matter. Mo. Const., Art. 3, § 23. See In re Ray, 83 B.R. 670 (Bkrtcy Ct., ED Mo. 1988); Berry v. Majestic Milling Co., 223 S.W. 738 (Mo. 1920). Moreover, none of the tort, property, or criminal law cases cited by the State was either based on or buttressed by a theological answer to the question of when life begins. Rather, the Missouri courts, as well as a number of other state courts, had already concluded that a ""fetus is a `person,' `minor,' or `minor child' within the meaning of their particular wrongful death statutes."" *571 O'Grady v. Brown, 654 S.W.2d 904, 910 (Mo. 1983) (en banc).[15]
Bolstering my conclusion that the preamble violates the First Amendment is the fact that the intensely divisive character of much of the national debate over the abortion issue reflects the deeply held religious convictions of many participants in the debate.[16] The Missouri Legislature may not inject its endorsement of a particular religious tradition into this debate, for ""[t]he Establishment Clause does not allow public bodies to foment such disagreement."" See County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, post, at 651 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).
In my opinion the preamble to the Missouri statute is unconstitutional for two reasons. To the extent that it has substantive impact on the freedom to use contraceptive procedures, it is inconsistent with the central holding in Griswold. To the extent that it merely makes ""legislative findings without operative effect,"" as the State argues, Brief for Appellants 22, it violates the Establishment Clause of the First *572 Amendment. Contrary to the theological ""finding"" of the Missouri Legislature, a woman's constitutionally protected liberty encompasses the right to act on her own belief that  to paraphrase St. Thomas Aquinas  until a seed has acquired the powers of sensation and movement, the life of a human being has not yet begun.[17]
"
27849,Justice Rehnquist,majority,False,Webster v. Reproductive Health Services,,1989,1.0,"This appeal concerns the constitutionality of a Missouri statute regulating the performance of abortions. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit struck down several provisions of the statute on the ground that they violated this Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and cases following it. We noted probable jurisdiction, 488 U.S. 1003 (1989), and now reverse.


*500 I
In June 1986, the Governor of Missouri signed into law Missouri Senate Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1596 (hereinafter Act or statute), which amended existing state law concerning unborn children and abortions.[1]*501 The Act consisted of 20 provisions, 5 of which are now before the Court. The first provision, or preamble, contains ""findings"" by the state legislature that ""[t]he life of each human being begins at conception,"" and that ""unborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and well-being."" Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ 1.205.1(1), (2) (1986). The Act further requires that all Missouri laws be interpreted to provide unborn children with the same rights enjoyed by other persons, subject to the Federal Constitution and this Court's precedents. § 1.205.2. Among its other provisions, the Act requires that, prior to performing an abortion on any woman whom a physician has reason to believe is 20 or more weeks pregnant, the physician ascertain whether the fetus is viable by performing ""such medical examinations and tests as are necessary to make a finding of the gestational age, weight, and lung maturity of the unborn child."" § 188.029. The Act also prohibits the use of public employees and facilities to perform or assist abortions not necessary to save the mother's life, and it prohibits the use of public funds, employees, or facilities for the purpose of ""encouraging or counseling"" a woman to have an abortion not necessary to save her life. §§ 188.205, 188.210, 188.215.
In July 1986, five health professionals employed by the State and two nonprofit corporations brought this class action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri to challenge the constitutionality of the Missouri statute. Plaintiffs, appellees in this Court, sought declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that certain statutory provisions violated the First, Fourth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution. App. A9. They asserted violations of various rights, including the ""privacy *502 rights of pregnant women seeking abortions""; the ""woman's right to an abortion""; the ""righ[t] to privacy in the physician-patient relationship""; the physician's ""righ[t] to practice medicine""; the pregnant woman's ""right to life due to inherent risks involved in childbirth""; and the woman's right to ""receive . . . adequate medical advice and treatment"" concerning abortions. Id., at A17-A19.
Plaintiffs filed this suit ""on their own behalf and on behalf of the entire class consisting of facilities and Missouri licensed physicians or other health care professionals offering abortion services or pregnancy counseling and on behalf of the entire class of pregnant females seeking abortion services or pregnancy counseling within the State of Missouri."" Id., at A13. The two nonprofit corporations are Reproductive Health Services, which offers family planning and gynecological services to the public, including abortion services up to 22 weeks ""gestational age,""[2] and Planned Parenthood of Kansas City, which provides abortion services up to 14 weeks gestational age. Id., at A9-A10. The individual plaintiffs are three physicians, one nurse, and a social worker. All are ""public employees"" at ""public facilities"" in Missouri, and they are paid for their services with ""public funds,"" as those terms are defined by § 188.200. The individual plaintiffs, within the scope of their public employment, encourage and counsel pregnant women to have nontherapeutic abortions. Two of the physicians perform abortions. App. A54-A55.
Several weeks after the complaint was filed, the District Court temporarily restrained enforcement of several provisions of the Act. Following a 3-day trial in December 1986, the District Court declared seven provisions of the Act unconstitutional and enjoined their enforcement. 662 F. Supp. 407 (WD Mo. 1987). These provisions included the preamble, § 1.205; the ""informed consent"" provision, which required *503 physicians to inform the pregnant woman of certain facts before performing an abortion, § 188.039; the requirement that post-16-week abortions be performed only in hospitals, § 188.025; the mandated tests to determine viability, § 188.029; and the prohibition on the use of public funds, employees, and facilities to perform or assist nontherapeutic abortions, and the restrictions on the use of public funds, employees, and facilities to encourage or counsel women to have such abortions, §§ 188.205, 188.210, 188.215. Id., at 430.
The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, with one exception not relevant to this appeal. 851 F.2d 1071 (1988). The Court of Appeals determined that Missouri's declaration that life begins at conception was ""simply an impermissible state adoption of a theory of when life begins to justify its abortion regulations."" Id., at 1076. Relying on Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 388-389 (1979), it further held that the requirement that physicians perform viability tests was an unconstitutional legislative intrusion on a matter of medical skill and judgment. 851 F.2d, at 1074-1075. The Court of Appeals invalidated Missouri's prohibition on the use of public facilities and employees to perform or assist abortions not necessary to save the mother's life. Id., at 1081-1083. It distinguished our decisions in Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980), and Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464 (1977), on the ground that "" `[t]here is a fundamental difference between providing direct funding to effect the abortion decision and allowing staff physicians to perform abortions at an existing publicly owned hospital.' "" 851 F.2d, at 1081, quoting Nyberg v. City of Virginia, 667 F.2d 754, 758 (CA8 1982), appeal dism'd, 462 U.S. 1125 (1983). The Court of Appeals struck down the provision prohibiting the use of public funds for ""encouraging or counseling"" women to have nontherapeutic abortions, for the reason that this provision was both overly vague and inconsistent with the right to an abortion enunciated in Roe v. Wade. 851 F. 2d, at 1077-1080. The court also invalidated the hospitalization *504 requirement for 16-week abortions, id., at 1073-1074, and the prohibition on the use of public employees and facilities for abortion counseling, id., at 1077-1080, but the State has not appealed those parts of the judgment below. See Juris. Statement I-II.[3]

II
Decision of this case requires us to address four sections of the Missouri Act: (a) the preamble; (b) the prohibition on the use of public facilities or employees to perform abortions; (c) the prohibition on public funding of abortion counseling; and (d) the requirement that physicians conduct viability tests prior to performing abortions. We address these seriatim.

A
The Act's preamble, as noted, sets forth ""findings"" by the Missouri Legislature that ""[t]he life of each human being begins at conception,"" and that ""[u]nborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and well-being."" Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ 1.205.1(1), (2) (1986). The Act then mandates that state laws be interpreted to provide unborn children with ""all the rights, privileges, and immunities available to other persons, citizens, and residents of this state,"" subject to the Constitution and this Court's precedents. § 1.205.2.[4] In invalidating *505 the preamble, the Court of Appeals relied on this Court's dictum that "" `a State may not adopt one theory of when life begins to justify its regulation of abortions.' "" 851 F.2d, at 1075-1076, quoting Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416, 444 (1983), in turn citing Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S., at 159-162. It rejected Missouri's claim that the preamble was ""abortion-neutral,"" and ""merely determine[d] when life begins in a nonabortion context, a traditional state prerogative."" 851 F.2d, at 1076. The court thought that ""[t]he only plausible inference"" from the fact that ""every remaining section of the bill save one regulates the performance of abortions"" was that ""the state intended its abortion regulations to be understood against the backdrop of its theory of life."" Ibid.[5]
The State contends that the preamble itself is precatory and imposes no substantive restrictions on abortions, and that appellees therefore do not have standing to challenge it. Brief for Appellants 21-24. Appellees, on the other hand, insist that the preamble is an operative part of the Act intended to guide the interpretation of other provisions of the Act. Brief for Appellees 19-23. They maintain, for example, that the preamble's definition of life may prevent physicians *506 in public hospitals from dispensing certain forms of contraceptives, such as the intrauterine device. Id., at 22.
In our view, the Court of Appeals misconceived the meaning of the Akron dictum, which was only that a State could not ""justify"" an abortion regulation otherwise invalid under Roe v. Wade on the ground that it embodied the State's view about when life begins. Certainly the preamble does not by its terms regulate abortion or any other aspect of appellees' medical practice. The Court has emphasized that Roe v. Wade ""implies no limitation on the authority of a State to make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion."" Maher v. Roe, 432 U. S., at 474. The preamble can be read simply to express that sort of value judgment.
We think the extent to which the preamble's language might be used to interpret other state statutes or regulations is something that only the courts of Missouri can definitively decide. State law has offered protections to unborn children in tort and probate law, see Roe v. Wade, supra, at 161-162, and § 1.205.2 can be interpreted to do no more than that. What we have, then, is much the same situation that the Court confronted in Alabama State Federation of Labor v. McAdory, 325 U.S. 450 (1945). As in that case:
""We are thus invited to pass upon the constitutional validity of a state statute which has not yet been applied or threatened to be applied by the state courts to petitioners or others in the manner anticipated. Lacking any authoritative construction of the statute by the state courts, without which no constitutional question arises, and lacking the authority to give such a controlling construction ourselves, and with a record which presents no concrete set of facts to which the statute is to be applied, the case is plainly not one to be disposed of by the declaratory judgment procedure."" Id., at 460.
It will be time enough for federal courts to address the meaning of the preamble should it be applied to restrict the activities of appellees in some concrete way. Until then, this *507 Court ""is not empowered to decide . . . abstract propositions, or to declare, for the government of future cases, principles or rules of law which cannot affect the result as to the thing in issue in the case before it."" Tyler v. Judges of Court of Registration, 179 U.S. 405, 409 (1900). See also Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 473 (1982).[6] We therefore need not pass on the constitutionality of the Act's preamble.

B
Section 188.210 provides that ""[i]t shall be unlawful for any public employee within the scope of his employment to perform or assist an abortion, not necessary to save the life of the mother,"" while § 188.215 makes it ""unlawful for any public facility to be used for the purpose of performing or assisting an abortion not necessary to save the life of the mother.""[7] The Court of Appeals held that these provisions contravened this Court's abortion decisions. 851 F.2d, at 1082-1083. We take the contrary view.
As we said earlier this Term in DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services, 489 U.S. 189, 196 (1989): ""[O]ur cases have recognized that the Due Process Clauses generally confer no affirmative right to governmental aid, even where such aid may be necessary to secure life, liberty, or property interests of which the government itself may not deprive the individual."" In Maher v. Roe, supra, the Court upheld a Connecticut welfare regulation under which Medicaid recipients received payments for medical services related *508 to childbirth, but not for nontherapeutic abortions. The Court rejected the claim that this unequal subsidization of childbirth and abortion was impermissible under Roe v. Wade. As the Court put it:
""The Connecticut regulation before us is different in kind from the laws invalidated in our previous abortion decisions. The Connecticut regulation places no obstacles  absolute or otherwise  in the pregnant woman's path to an abortion. An indigent woman who desires an abortion suffers no disadvantage as a consequence of Connecticut's decision to fund childbirth; she continues as before to be dependent on private sources for the service she desires. The State may have made childbirth a more attractive alternative, thereby influencing the woman's decision, but it has imposed no restriction on access to abortions that was not already there. The indigency that may make it difficult  and in some cases, perhaps, impossible  for some women to have abortions is neither created nor in any way affected by the Connecticut regulation."" 432 U.S., at 474.
Relying on Maher, the Court in Poelker v. Doe, 432 U.S. 519, 521 (1977), held that the city of St. Louis committed ""no constitutional violation . . . in electing, as a policy choice, to provide publicly financed hospital services for childbirth without providing corresponding services for nontherapeutic abortions.""
More recently, in Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980), the Court upheld ""the most restrictive version of the Hyde Amendment,"" id., at 325, n. 27, which withheld from States federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse the costs of abortions, "" `except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.' "" Ibid. (quoting Pub. L. 94-439, § 209, 90 Stat. 1434). As in Maher and Poelker, the Court required only a showing that Congress' authorization of ""reimbursement for medically necessary services generally, but not for certain medically necessary *509 abortions"" was rationally related to the legitimate governmental goal of encouraging childbirth. 448 U.S., at 325.
The Court of Appeals distinguished these cases on the ground that ""[t]o prevent access to a public facility does more than demonstrate a political choice in favor of childbirth; it clearly narrows and in some cases forecloses the availability of abortion to women."" 851 F.2d, at 1081. The court reasoned that the ban on the use of public facilities ""could prevent a woman's chosen doctor from performing an abortion because of his unprivileged status at other hospitals or because a private hospital adopted a similar anti-abortion stance."" Ibid. It also thought that ""[s]uch a rule could increase the cost of obtaining an abortion and delay the timing of it as well."" Ibid.
We think that this analysis is much like that which we rejected in Maher, Poelker, and McRae. As in those cases, the State's decision here to use public facilities and staff to encourage childbirth over abortion ""places no governmental obstacle in the path of a woman who chooses to terminate her pregnancy."" McRae, 448 U. S., at 315. Just as Congress' refusal to fund abortions in McRae left ""an indigent woman with at least the same range of choice in deciding whether to obtain a medically necessary abortion as she would have had if Congress had chosen to subsidize no health care costs at all,"" id., at 317, Missouri's refusal to allow public employees to perform abortions in public hospitals leaves a pregnant woman with the same choices as if the State had chosen not to operate any public hospitals at all. The challenged provisions only restrict a woman's ability to obtain an abortion to the extent that she chooses to use a physician affiliated with a public hospital. This circumstance is more easily remedied, and thus considerably less burdensome, than indigency, which ""may make it difficult  and in some cases, perhaps, impossible  for some women to have abortions"" without public funding. Maher, 432 U. S., at 474. Having held that the State's refusal to fund abortions does not violate Roe v. Wade, it strains logic to reach a contrary result for the use *510 of public facilities and employees. If the State may ""make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion and . . . implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds,"" Maher, supra, at 474, surely it may do so through the allocation of other public resources, such as hospitals and medical staff.
The Court of Appeals sought to distinguish our cases on the additional ground that ""[t]he evidence here showed that all of the public facility's costs in providing abortion services are recouped when the patient pays."" 851 F.2d, at 1083. Absent any expenditure of public funds, the court thought that Missouri was ""expressing"" more than ""its preference for childbirth over abortions,"" but rather was creating an ""obstacle to exercise of the right to choose an abortion [that could not] stand absent a compelling state interest."" Ibid. We disagree.
""Constitutional concerns are greatest,"" we said in Maher, supra, at 476, ""when the State attempts to impose its will by the force of law; the State's power to encourage actions deemed to be in the public interest is necessarily far broader."" Nothing in the Constitution requires States to enter or remain in the business of performing abortions. Nor, as appellees suggest, do private physicians and their patients have some kind of constitutional right of access to public facilities for the performance of abortions. Brief for Appellees 46-47. Indeed, if the State does recoup all of its costs in performing abortions, and no state subsidy, direct or indirect, is available, it is difficult to see how any procreational choice is burdened by the State's ban on the use of its facilities or employees for performing abortions.[8]
*511 Maher, Poelker, and McRae all support the view that the State need not commit any resources to facilitating abortions, even if it can turn a profit by doing so. In Poelker, the suit was filed by an indigent who could not afford to pay for an abortion, but the ban on the performance of nontherapeutic abortions in city-owned hospitals applied whether or not the pregnant woman could pay. 432 U.S., at 520; id., at 524 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).[9] The Court emphasized that the mayor's decision to prohibit abortions in city hospitals was ""subject to public debate and approval or disapproval at the polls,"" and that ""the Constitution does not forbid a State or city, pursuant to democratic processes, from expressing a preference for normal childbirth as St. Louis has done."" Id., at 521. Thus we uphold the Act's restrictions on the use of public employees and facilities for the performance or assistance of nontherapeutic abortions.

C
The Missouri Act contains three provisions relating to ""encouraging or counseling a woman to have an abortion not necessary to save her life."" Section 188.205 states that no public funds can be used for this purpose; § 188.210 states that public employees cannot, within the scope of their employment, engage in such speech; and § 188.215 forbids such speech in public facilities. The Court of Appeals did not consider § 188.205 separately from §§ 188.210 and 188.215. It held that all three of these provisions were unconstitutionally vague, and that ""the ban on using public funds, employees, and facilities to encourage or counsel a woman to have an abortion is an unacceptable infringement of the woman's fourteenth amendment right to choose an abortion after receiving *512 the medical information necessary to exercise the right knowingly and intelligently."" 851 F.2d, at 1079.[10]
Missouri has chosen only to appeal the Court of Appeals' invalidation of the public funding provision, § 188.205. See Juris. Statement I-II. A threshold question is whether this provision reaches primary conduct, or whether it is simply an instruction to the State's fiscal officers not to allocate funds for abortion counseling. We accept, for purposes of decision, the State's claim that § 188.205 ""is not directed at the conduct of any physician or health care provider, private or public,"" but ""is directed solely at those persons responsible for expending public funds."" Brief for Appellants 43.[11]
Appellees contend that they are not ""adversely"" affected under the State's interpretation of § 188.205, and therefore that there is no longer a case or controversy before us on this question. Brief for Appellees 31-32. Plaintiffs are masters of their complaints and remain so at the appellate stage of a litigation. See Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 398-399 (1987). A majority of the Court agrees with appellees that the controversy over § 188.205 is now moot, because appellees' argument amounts to a decision to no longer seek a declaratory judgment that § 188.205 is unconstitutional and accompanying declarative relief. See Deakins v. Monaghan, 484 U.S. 193, 199-201 (1988); United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 39-40 (1950). We accordingly direct the Court of Appeals to vacate the judgment of the District Court *513 with instructions to dismiss the relevant part of the complaint. Deakins, 484 U. S., at 200. ""Because this [dispute] was rendered moot in part by [appellees'] willingness permanently to withdraw their equitable claims from their federal action, a dismissal with prejudice is indicated."" Ibid.

D
Section 188.029 of the Missouri Act provides:
""Before a physician performs an abortion on a woman he has reason to believe is carrying an unborn child of twenty or more weeks gestational age, the physician shall first determine if the unborn child is viable by using and exercising that degree of care, skill, and proficiency commonly exercised by the ordinarily skillful, careful, and prudent physician engaged in similar practice under the same or similar conditions. In making this determination of viability, the physician shall perform or cause to be performed such medical examinations and tests as are necessary to make a finding of the gestational age, weight, and lung maturity of the unborn child and shall enter such findings and determination of viability in the medical record of the mother.""[12]
As with the preamble, the parties disagree over the meaning of this statutory provision. The State emphasizes the language of the first sentence, which speaks in terms of the physician's determination of viability being made by the standards of ordinary skill in the medical profession. Brief for Appellants 32-35. Appellees stress the language of the second sentence, which prescribes such ""tests as are necessary"" to make a finding of gestational age, fetal weight, and lung maturity. Brief for Appellees 26-30.
*514 The Court of Appeals read § 188.029 as requiring that after 20 weeks ""doctors must perform tests to find gestational age, fetal weight and lung maturity."" 851 F.2d, at 1075, n. 5. The court indicated that the tests needed to determine fetal weight at 20 weeks are ""unreliable and inaccurate"" and would add $125 to $250 to the cost of an abortion. Ibid. It also stated that ""amniocentesis, the only method available to determine lung maturity, is contrary to accepted medical practice until 28-30 weeks of gestation, expensive, and imposes significant health risks for both the pregnant woman and the fetus."" Ibid.
We must first determine the meaning of § 188.029 under Missouri law. Our usual practice is to defer to the lower court's construction of a state statute, but we believe the Court of Appeals has ""fallen into plain error"" in this case. Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 483 (1988); see Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 500, n. 9 (1985). "" `In expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.' "" Philbrook v. Glodgett, 421 U.S. 707, 713 (1975), quoting United States v. Heirs of Boisdore, 8 How. 113, 122 (1849). See Chemehuevi Tribe of Indians v. FPC, 420 U.S. 395, 402-403 (1975); Kokoszka v. Belford, 417 U.S. 642, 650 (1974). The Court of Appeals' interpretation also runs ""afoul of the well-established principle that statutes will be interpreted to avoid constitutional difficulties."" Frisby, supra, at 483.
We think the viability-testing provision makes sense only if the second sentence is read to require only those tests that are useful to making subsidiary findings as to viability. If we construe this provision to require a physician to perform those tests needed to make the three specified findings in all circumstances, including when the physician's reasonable professional judgment indicates that the tests would be irrelevant to determining viability or even dangerous to the mother and the fetus, the second sentence of § 188.029 would *515 conflict with the first sentence's requirement that a physician apply his reasonable professional skill and judgment. It would also be incongruous to read this provision, especially the word ""necessary,""[13] to require the performance of tests irrelevant to the expressed statutory purpose of determining viability. It thus seems clear to us that the Court of Appeals' construction of § 188.029 violates well-accepted canons of statutory interpretation used in the Missouri courts, see State ex rel. Stern Brothers & Co. v. Stilley, 337 S.W.2d 934, 939 (Mo. 1960) (""The basic rule of statutory construction is to first seek the legislative intention, and to effectuate it if possible, and the law favors constructions which harmonize with reason, and which tend to avoid unjust, absurd, unreasonable or confiscatory results, or oppression""); Bell v. Mid-Century Ins. Co., 750 S.W.2d 708, 710 (Mo. App. 1988) (""Interpreting the phrase literally would produce an absurd result, which the Legislature is strongly presumed not to have intended""), which JUSTICE BLACKMUN ignores. Post, at 545-546.
The viability-testing provision of the Missouri Act is concerned with promoting the State's interest in potential human life rather than in maternal health. Section 188.029 creates what is essentially a presumption of viability at 20 weeks, which the physician must rebut with tests indicating that the fetus is not viable prior to performing an abortion. It also directs the physician's determination as to viability by specifying consideration, if feasible, of gestational age, fetal weight, and lung capacity. The District Court found that ""the medical evidence is uncontradicted that a 20-week fetus is not viable,"" and that ""23 1/2 to 24 weeks gestation is the earliest point in pregnancy where a reasonable possibility of viability *516 exists."" 662 F. Supp., at 420. But it also found that there may be a 4-week error in estimating gestational age, id., at 421, which supports testing at 20 weeks.
In Roe v. Wade, the Court recognized that the State has ""important and legitimate"" interests in protecting maternal health and in the potentiality of human life. 410 U.S., at 162. During the second trimester, the State ""may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health."" Id., at 164. After viability, when the State's interest in potential human life was held to become compelling, the State ""may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother."" Id., at 165.[14]
In Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379 (1979), upon which appellees rely, the Court held that a Pennsylvania statute regulating the standard of care to be used by a physician performing an abortion of a possibly viable fetus was void for vagueness. Id., at 390-401. But in the course of reaching that conclusion, the Court reaffirmed its earlier statement in Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 64 (1976), that "" `the determination of whether a particular *517 fetus is viable is, and must be, a matter for the judgment of the responsible attending physician.' "" 439 U.S., at 396. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, post, at 545, n. 6, ignores the statement in Colautti that ""neither the legislature nor the courts may proclaim one of the elements entering into the ascertainment of viability  be it weeks of gestation or fetal weight or any other single factor  as the determinant of when the State has a compelling interest in the life or health of the fetus."" 439 U.S., at 388-389. To the extent that § 188.029 regulates the method for determining viability, it undoubtedly does superimpose state regulation on the medical determination whether a particular fetus is viable. The Court of Appeals and the District Court thought it unconstitutional for this reason. 851 F.2d, at 1074-1075; 662 F. Supp., at 423. To the extent that the viability tests increase the cost of what are in fact second-trimester abortions, their validity may also be questioned under Akron, 462 U. S., at 434-435, where the Court held that a requirement that second-trimester abortions must be performed in hospitals was invalid because it substantially increased the expense of those procedures.
We think that the doubt cast upon the Missouri statute by these cases is not so much a flaw in the statute as it is a reflection of the fact that the rigid trimester analysis of the course of a pregnancy enunciated in Roe has resulted in subsequent cases like Colautti and Akron making constitutional law in this area a virtual Procrustean bed. Statutes specifying elements of informed consent to be provided abortion patients, for example, were invalidated if they were thought to ""structur[e] . . . the dialogue between the woman and her physician."" Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 763 (1986). As the dissenters in Thornburgh pointed out, such a statute would have been sustained under any traditional standard of judicial review, id., at 802 (WHITE, J., dissenting), or for any other surgical procedure except abortion. Id., at 783 (Burger, C. J., dissenting).
*518 Stare decisis is a cornerstone of our legal system, but it has less power in constitutional cases, where, save for constitutional amendments, this Court is the only body able to make needed changes. See United States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82, 101 (1978). We have not refrained from reconsideration of a prior construction of the Constitution that has proved ""unsound in principle and unworkable in practice."" Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U.S. 528, 546 (1985); see Solorio v. United States, 483 U.S. 435, 448-450 (1987); Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 74-78 (1938). We think the Roe trimester framework falls into that category.
In the first place, the rigid Roe framework is hardly consistent with the notion of a Constitution cast in general terms, as ours is, and usually speaking in general principles, as ours does. The key elements of the Roe framework  trimesters and viability  are not found in the text of the Constitution or in any place else one would expect to find a constitutional principle. Since the bounds of the inquiry are essentially indeterminate, the result has been a web of legal rules that have become increasingly intricate, resembling a code of regulations rather than a body of constitutional doctrine.[15] As JUSTICE WHITE has put it, the trimester framework *519 has left this Court to serve as the country's ""ex officio medical board with powers to approve or disapprove medical and operative practices and standards throughout the United States."" Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S., at 99 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Cf. Garcia, supra, at 547.
In the second place, we do not see why the State's interest in protecting potential human life should come into existence only at the point of viability, and that there should therefore be a rigid line allowing state regulation after viability but prohibiting it before viability. The dissenters in Thornburgh, writing in the context of the Roe trimester analysis, would have recognized this fact by positing against the ""fundamental right"" recognized in Roe the State's ""compelling interest"" in protecting potential human life throughout pregnancy. ""[T]he State's interest, if compelling after viability, is equally compelling before viability."" Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 795 (WHITE, J., dissenting); see id., at 828 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting) (""State has compelling interests in ensuring maternal health and in protecting potential human life, and these interests exist `throughout pregnancy' "") (citation omitted).
The tests that § 188.029 requires the physician to perform are designed to determine viability. The State here has chosen viability as the point at which its interest in potential human life must be safeguarded. See Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.030 (1986) (""No abortion of a viable unborn child shall be performed unless necessary to preserve the life or health of the woman""). It is true that the tests in question increase the expense of abortion, and regulate the discretion of the physician in determining the viability of the fetus. Since the tests will undoubtedly show in many cases that the fetus is not viable, the tests will have been performed for what were in fact second-trimester abortions. But we are satisfied that the requirement of these tests permissibly furthers *520 the State's interest in protecting potential human life, and we therefore believe § 188.029 to be constitutional.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN takes us to task for our failure to join in a ""great issues"" debate as to whether the Constitution includes an ""unenumerated"" general right to privacy as recognized in cases such as Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), and Roe. But Griswold v. Connecticut, unlike Roe, did not purport to adopt a whole framework, complete with detailed rules and distinctions, to govern the cases in which the asserted liberty interest would apply. As such, it was far different from the opinion, if not the holding, of Roe v. Wade, which sought to establish a constitutional framework for judging state regulation of abortion during the entire term of pregnancy. That framework sought to deal with areas of medical practice traditionally subject to state regulation, and it sought to balance once and for all by reference only to the calendar the claims of the State to protect the fetus as a form of human life against the claims of a woman to decide for herself whether or not to abort a fetus she was carrying. The experience of the Court in applying Roe v. Wade in later cases, see supra, at 518, n. 15, suggests to us that there is wisdom in not unnecessarily attempting to elaborate the abstract differences between a ""fundamental right"" to abortion, as the Court described it in Akron, 462 U. S. at 420, n. 1, a ""limited fundamental constitutional right,"" which JUSTICE BLACKMUN today treats Roe as having established, post, at 555, or a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause, which we believe it to be. The Missouri testing requirement here is reasonably designed to ensure that abortions are not performed where the fetus is viable  an end which all concede is legitimate  and that is sufficient to sustain its constitutionality.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN also accuses us, inter alia, of cowardice and illegitimacy in dealing with ""the most politically divisive domestic legal issue of our time."" Post, at 559. There is *521 no doubt that our holding today will allow some governmental regulation of abortion that would have been prohibited under the language of cases such as Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379 (1979), and Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., supra. But the goal of constitutional adjudication is surely not to remove inexorably ""politically divisive"" issues from the ambit of the legislative process, whereby the people through their elected representatives deal with matters of concern to them. The goal of constitutional adjudication is to hold true the balance between that which the Constitution puts beyond the reach of the democratic process and that which it does not. We think we have done that today. JUSTICE BLACKMUN'S suggestion, post, at 538, 557-558, that legislative bodies, in a Nation where more than half of our population is women, will treat our decision today as an invitation to enact abortion regulation reminiscent of the Dark Ages not only misreads our views but does scant justice to those who serve in such bodies and the people who elect them.

III
Both appellants and the United States as amicus curiae have urged that we overrule our decision in Roe v. Wade. Brief for Appellants 12-18; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 8-24. The facts of the present case, however, differ from those at issue in Roe. Here, Missouri has determined that viability is the point at which its interest in potential human life must be safeguarded. In Roe, on the other hand, the Texas statute criminalized the performance of all abortions, except when the mother's life was at stake. 410 U.S., at 117-118. This case therefore affords us no occasion to revisit the holding of Roe, which was that the Texas statute unconstitutionally infringed the right to an abortion derived from the Due Process Clause, id., at 164, and we leave it undisturbed. To the extent indicated in our opinion, we would modify and narrow Roe and succeeding cases.
*522A Because none of the challenged provisions of the Missouri Act properly before us conflict with the Constitution, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Reversed.
*522B JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment."
25705,Justice Blackmun,dissenting,False,Rust v. Sullivan,,1991,1.0,"Casting aside established principles of statutory construction and administrative jurisprudence, the majority in these cases today unnecessarily passes upon important questions of constitutional law. In so doing, the Court, for the first time, upholds viewpoint-based suppression of speech solely because it is imposed on those dependent upon the Government for economic support. Under essentially the same rationale, the majority upholds direct regulation of dialogue between a pregnant woman and her physician when that regulation has both the purpose and the effect of manipulating her decision as to the continuance of her preguancy. I conclude that the Secretary's regulation of referral, advocacy, and counseling activities exceeds his statutory authority, and, also, that the regulations violate the First and Fifth Amendments of our Constitution. Accordingly, I dissent and would reverse the divided-vote judgment of the Court of Appeals.

I
The majority does not dispute that ""[f]ederal statutes are to be so construed as to avoid serious doubt of their constitutionality."" Machinists v. Street, 367 U.S. 740, 749 (1961). See also Hooper v. California, 155 U.S. 648, 657 (1895); Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 62 (1932); United States v. Security Industrial Bank, 459 U.S. 70, 78 (1982). Nor does the majority deny that this principle is fully applicable to cases such as the instant ones in which a plausible but constitutionally suspect statutory interpretation is embodied in an administrative regulation. See Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Construction Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988); NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U.S. 490 (1979); Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116, 129-130 (1958). Rather, in its zeal to address the constitutional issues, the majority sidesteps this established canon of construction with the feeble excuse that the challenged *205 regulations ""do not raise the sort of `grave and doubtful constitutional questions,' . . . that would lead us to assume Congress did not intend to authorize their issuance."" Ante, at 191, quoting United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U.S. 366, 408 (1909).
This facile response to the intractable problem the Court addresses today is disingenuous at best. Whether or not one believes that these regulations are valid, it avoids reality to contend that they do not give rise to serious constitutional questions. The canon is applicable to these cases not because ""it was likely that [the regulations] ... would be challenged on constitutional grounds,"" ante, at 191, but because the question squarely presented by the regulationsthe extent to which the Government may attach an otherwise unconstitutional condition to the receipt of a public benefitimplicates a troubled area of our jurisprudence in which a court ought not entangle itself unnecessarily. See, e. g., Epstein, Unconstitutional Conditions, State Power, and the Limits of Consent, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 4, 6 (1988) (describing this problem as ""the basic structural issue that for over a hundred years has bedeviled courts and commentators alike ...""); Sullivan, Unconstitutional Conditions, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 1413, 1415-1416 (1989) (observing that this Court's unconstitutional conditions cases ""seem a minefield to be traversed gingerly"").
As is discussed in Parts II and III, infra, the regulations impose viewpoint-based restrictions upon protected speech and are aimed at a woman's decision whether to continue or terminate her pregnancy. In both respects, they implicate core constitutional values. This verity is evidenced by the fact that two of the three Courts of Appeals that have entertained challenges to the regulations have invalidated them on constitutional grounds. See Massachusetts v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 899 F.2d 53 (CA1 1990); Planned Parenthood Federation of America v. Sullivan, 913 F.2d 1492 (CA10 1990).
*206 A divided panel of the Tenth Circuit found the regulations to ""fal[l] squarely within the prohibition in Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747 [(1986)], and City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416 [(1983)], against state intrusion into the advice a woman requests from or is given by her doctor."" Id., at 1501. The First Circuit, en banc with one judge dissenting, found the regulations to violate both the privacy rights of Title X patients and the First Amendment rights of Title X grantees. See also 889 F.2d 401, 415 (CA2 1989) (Kearse, J., dissenting in part). That a bare majority of this Court today reaches a different result does not change the fact that the constitutional questions raised by the regulations are both grave and doubtful.
Nor is this a situation in which the statutory language itself requires us to address a constitutional question. Section 1008 of the Public Health Service Act, 84 Stat. 1508, 42 U.S. C. § 300a-6, provides simply: ""None of the funds appropriated under this title shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning."" The majority concedes that this language ""does not speak directly to the issues of counseling, referral, advocacy, or program integrity,"" ante, at 184, and that ""the legislative history is ambiguous"" in this respect. Ante, at 186. Consequently, the language of § 1008 easily sustains a constitutionally trouble-free interpretation.[1]
*207 Thus, this is not a situation in which ""the intention of Congress is revealed too distinctly to permit us to ignore it because of mere misgivings as to power."" George Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, 289 U.S. 373, 379 (1933). Indeed, it would appear that our duty to avoid passing unnecessarily upon important constitutional questions is strongest where, as here, the language of the statute is decidedly ambiguous. It is both logical and eminently prudent to assume that when Congress intends to press the limits of constitutionality in its enactments, it will express that intent in explicit and unambiguous terms. See Sunstein, Law and Administration After Chevron, 90 Colum. L. Rev. 2071, 2113 (1990) (""It is thus implausible that, after Chevron, agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes will prevail even if the consequence of those interpretations is to produce invalidity or to raise serious constitutional doubts"").
Because I conclude that a plainly constitutional construction of § 1008 ""is not only `fairly possible' but entirely reasonable,"" Machinists, 367 U. S., at 750, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals on this ground without deciding the constitutionality of the Secretary's regulations.

II
I also strongly disagree with the majority's disposition of petitioners' constitutional claims, and because I feel that a response thereto is indicated, I move on to that issue.

A
Until today, the Court never has upheld viewpoint-based suppression of speech simply because that suppression was a condition upon the acceptance of public funds. Whatever may be the Government's power to condition the receipt of its largess upon the relinquishment of constitutional rights, it surely does not extend to a condition that suppresses the recipient's cherished freedom of speech based solely upon the content or viewpoint of that speech. Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 518-519 (1958) (""To deny an exemption to claimants *208 who engage in certain forms of speech is in effect to penalize them for such speech. . . . The denial is `frankly aimed at the suppression of dangerous ideas,'"" quoting American Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 402 (1950)). See Cammarano v. United States, 358 U.S. 498, 513 (1959). See also FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364, 407 (1984) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting). Cf. Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 237 (1987) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). This rule is a sound one, for, as the Court often has noted: ""`A regulation of speech that is motivated by nothing more than a desire to curtail expression of a particular point of view on controversial issues of general interest is the purest example of a ""law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.""'"" League of Women Voters, 468 U. S., at 383-384, quoting Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Service Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U.S. 530, 546 (1980) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). ""[A]bove all else, the First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content."" Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95 (1972).
Nothing in the Court's opinion in Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Washington, 461 U.S. 540 (1983), can be said to challenge this long-settled understanding. In Regan, the Court upheld a content-neutral provision of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S. C. § 501(c)(3), that disallowed a particular tax-exempt status to organizations that ""attempt[ed] to influence legislation,"" while affording such status to veteran's organizations irrespective of their lobbying activities. Finding the case controlled by Cammarano, supra, the Court explained: ""The case would be different if Congress were to discriminate invidiously in its subsidies in such a way as to `""ai[m] at the suppression of dangerous ideas.'"" . . . We find no indication that the statute was intended to suppress any ideas or any demonstration that it has had that effect."" 461 U.S., at 548, quoting Cammarano, 358 U. S., at *209 513, in turn quoting Speiser, 357 U. S., at 519. The separate concurrence in Regan joined the Court's opinion precisely ""[b]ecause 26 U.S. C. § 501's discrimination between veterans' organizations and charitable organizations is not based on the content of their speech."" 461 U.S., at 551.
It cannot seriously be disputed that the counseling and referral provisions at issue in the present cases constitute content-based regulation of speech. Title X grantees may provide counseling and referral regarding any of a wide range of family planning and other topics, save abortion. Cf. Consolidated Edison Co., 447 U. S., at 537 (""The First Amendment's hostility to content-based regulation extends not only to restrictions on particular viewpoints, but also to prohibition of public discussion of an entire topic""); Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 319 (1988) (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.) (same).
The regulations are also clearly viewpoint based. While suppressing speech favorable to abortion with one hand, the Secretary compels antiabortion speech with the other. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services' own description of the regulations makes plain that ""Title X projects are required to facilitate access to prenatal care and social services, including adoption services, that might be needed by the pregnant client to promote her well-being and that of her child, while making it abundantly clear that the project is not permitted to promote abortion by facilitating access to abortion through the referral process."" 53 Fed. Reg. 2927 (1988) (emphasis added).
Moreover, the regulations command that a project refer for prenatal care each woman diagnosed as pregnant, irrespective of the woman's expressed desire to continue or terminate her pregnancy. 42 CFR § 59.8(a)(2) (1990). If a client asks directly about abortion, a Title X physician or counselor is required to say, in essence, that the project does not consider abortion to be an appropriate method of family planning. § 59.8(b)(4). Both requirements are antithetical to *210 the First Amendment. See Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 714 (1977).
The regulations pertaining to ""advocacy"" are even more explicitly viewpoint based. These provide: ""A Title X project may not encourage, promote or advocate abortion as a method of family planning."" § 59.10 (emphasis added). They explain: ""This requirement prohibits actions to assist women to obtain abortions or increase the availability or accessibility of abortion for family planning purposes."" § 59.10(a) (emphasis added). The regulations do not, however, proscribe or even regulate antiabortion advocacy. These are clearly restrictions aimed at the suppression of ""dangerous ideas.""
Remarkably, the majority concludes that ""the Government has not discriminated on the basis of viewpoint; it has merely chosen to fund one activity to the exclusion of the other."" Ante, at 193. But the majority's claim that the regulations merely limit a Title X project's speech to preventive or preconceptional services, ibid., rings hollow in light of the broad range of nonpreventive services that the regulations authorize Title X projects to provide.[2] By refusing to fund those family-planning projects that advocate abortion because they advocate abortion, the Government plainly has targeted a particular viewpoint. Cf. Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781 (1989). The majority's reliance on the fact that the regulations pertain solely to funding decisions simply begs the question. Clearly, there are some bases upon which government may not rest its decision to fund or not to fund. For example, the Members of the majority surely would agree that government may not base its *211 decision to support an activity upon considerations of race. See, e. g., Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886). As demonstrated above, our cases make clear that ideological viewpoint is a similarly repugnant ground upon which to base funding decisions.
The majority's reliance upon Regan in this connection is also misplaced. That case stands for the proposition that government has no obligation to subsidize a private party's efforts to petition the legislature regarding its views. Thus, if the challenged regulations were confined to nonideological limitations upon the use of Title X funds for lobbying activities, there would exist no violation of the First Amendment. The advocacy regulations at issue here, however, are not limited to lobbying but extend to all speech having the effect of encouraging, promoting, or advocating abortion as a method of family planning. 42 CFR § 59.10(a) (1990). Thus, in addition to their impermissible focus upon the viewpoint of regulated speech, the provisions intrude upon a wide range of communicative conduct, including the very words spoken to a woman by her physician. By manipulating the content of the doctor-patient dialogue, the regulations upheld today force each of the petitioners ""to be an instrument for fostering public adherence to an ideological point of view [he or she] finds unacceptable."" Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S., at 715. This type of intrusive, ideologically based regulation of speech goes far beyond the narrow lobbying limitations approved in Regan and cannot be justified simply because it is a condition upon the receipt of a governmental benefit.[3]


*212 B
The Court concludes that the challenged regulations do not violate the First Amendment rights of Title X staff members because any limitation of the employees' freedom of expression is simply a consequence of their decision to accept employment at a federally funded project. Ante, at 198-199. But it has never been sufficient to justify an otherwise unconstitutional condition upon public employment that the employee may escape the condition by relinquishing his or her job. It is beyond question ""that a government may not require an individual to relinquish rights guaranteed him by the First Amendment as a condition of public employment."" Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U.S. 209, 234 (1977), citing Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 357-360 (1976), and cases cited therein; Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593 (1972); Keyishian v. Board of Regents, State Univ. of N. Y., 385 U.S. 589 (1967). Nearly two decades ago, it was said:
""For at least a quarter-century, this Court has made clear that even though a person has no `right' to a valuable governmental benefit and even though the government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons, there are some reasons upon which the government may not rely. It may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interestsespecially, his interest in freedom of speech. For if the government could deny a benefit to a *213 person because of his constitutionally protected speech or associations, his exercise of those freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited. This would allow the government to `produce a result which [it] could not command directly.'"" Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S., at 597, quoting Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S., at 526.
The majority attempts to circumvent this principle by emphasizing that Title X physicians and counselors ""remain free ... to pursue abortion-related activities when they are not acting under the auspices of the Title X project."" Ante, at 198. ""The regulations,"" the majority explains, ""do not in any way restrict the activities of those persons acting as private individuals."" Ante, at 198, 199. Under the majority's reasoning, the First Amendment could be read to tolerate any governmental restriction upon an employee's speech so long as that restriction is limited to the funded workplace. This is a dangerous proposition, and one the Court has rightly rejected in the past.
In Abood, it was no answer to the petitioners' claim of compelled speech as a condition upon public employment that their speech outside the workplace remained unregulated by the State. Nor was the public employee's First Amendment claim in Rankin v. McPherson, 483 U.S. 378 (1987), derogated because the communication that her employer sought to punish occurred during business hours. At the least, such conditions require courts to balance the speaker's interest in the message against those of government in preventing its dissemination. Id., at 384; Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist., 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968).
In the cases at bar, the speaker's interest in the communication is both clear and vital. In addressing the family-planning needs of their clients, the physicians and counselors who staff Title X projects seek to provide them with the full range of information and options regarding their health and reproductive freedom. Indeed, the legitimate expectations *214 of the patient and the ethical responsibilities of the medical profession demand no less. ""The patient's right of self-decision can be effectively exercised only if the patient possesses enough information to enable an intelligent choice. . . . The physician has an ethical obligation to help the patient make choices from among the therapeutic alternatives consistent with good medical practice."" Current Opinions of Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs of American Medical Association ¶ 8.08 (1989). See also President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research, Making Health Care Decisions 70 (1982); American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Standards for Obstetric-Gynecologic Services 62 (7th ed. 1989). When a client becomes pregnant, the full range of therapeutic alternatives includes the abortion option, and Title X counselors' interest in providing this information is compelling.
The Government's articulated interest in distorting the doctor-patient dialogueensuring that federal funds are not spent for a purpose outside the scope of the programfalls far short of that necessary to justify the suppression of truthful information and professional medical opinion regarding constitutionally protected conduct.[4] Moreover, the offending regulation is not narrowly tailored to serve this interest. For example, the governmental interest at stake could be served by imposing rigorous bookkeeping standards to ensure financial separation or adopting content-neutral rules for the balanced dissemination of family-planning and health information. See Massachusetts v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 899 F.2d 53, 74 (CA1 1990), cert. pending, No. 89-1929. By failing to balance or even to consider the free speech interests claimed by Title X physicians against the Government's asserted interest in suppressing the speech, the Court falters in its duty to implement the protection *215 that the First Amendment clearly provides for this important message.

C
Finally, it is of no small significance that the speech the Secretary would suppress is truthful information regarding constitutionally protected conduct of vital importance to the listener. One can imagine no legitimate governmental interest that might be served by suppressing such information. Concededly, the abortion debate is among the most divisive and contentious issues that our Nation has faced in recent years. ""But freedom to differ is not limited to things that do not matter much. That would be a mere shadow of freedom. The test of its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing order."" West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943).

III
By far the most disturbing aspect of today's ruling is the effect it will have on the Fifth Amendment rights of the women who, supposedly, are beneficiaries of Title X programs. The majority rejects petitioners' Fifth Amendment claims summarily. It relies primarily upon the decisions in Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980), and Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490 (1989). There were dissents in those cases, and we continue to believe that they were wrongly and unfortunately decided. Be that as it may, even if one accepts as valid the Court's theorizing in those cases, the majority's reasoning in the present cases is flawed.
Until today, the Court has allowed to stand only those restrictions upon reproductive freedom that, while limiting the availability of abortion, have left intact a woman's ability to decide without coercion whether she will continue her pregnancy to term. Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464 (1977), McRae, and Webster are all to this effect. Today's decision abandons that principle, and with disastrous results.
*216 Contrary to the majority's characterization, this is not a situation in which individuals seek Government aid in exercising their fundamental rights. The Fifth Amendment right asserted by petitioners is the right of a pregnant woman to be free from affirmative governmental interference in her decision. Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and its progeny are not so much about a medical procedure as they are about a woman's fundamental right to self-determination. Those cases serve to vindicate the idea that ""liberty,"" if it means anything, must entail freedom from governmental domination in making the most intimate and personal of decisions. See, e. g., Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416, 444 (1983) (governmental interest in ensuring that pregnant women receive medically relevant information ""will not justify abortion regulations designed to influence the woman's informed choice between abortion or childbirth""); Maher v. Roe, 432 U. S., at 473 (noting that the Court's abortion cases ""recognize a constitutionally protected interest `in making certain kinds of important decisions' free from governmental compulsion,"" quoting Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599 (1977)); see also Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S., at 312; Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 759 (1986); Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S., at 169-170 (Stewart, J., concurring). By suppressing medically pertinent information and injecting a restrictive ideological message unrelated to considerations of maternal health, the Government places formidable obstacles in the path of Title X clients' freedom of choice and thereby violates their Fifth Amendment rights.
It is crystal clear that the aim of the challenged provisionsan aim the majority cannot escape noticingis not simply to ensure that federal funds are not used to perform abortions, but to ""reduce the incidence of abortion."" 42 CFR § 59.2 (1990) (in definition of ""family planning""). As recounted above, the regulations require Title X physicians and counselors to provide information pertaining only to child-birth, *217 to refer a pregnant woman for prenatal care irrespective of her medical situation, and, upon direct inquiry, to respond that abortion is not an ""appropriate method"" of family planning.
The undeniable message conveyed by this forced speech, and the one that the Title X client will draw from it, is that abortion nearly always is an improper medical option. Although her physician's words, in fact, are strictly controlled by the Government and wholly unrelated to her particular medical situation, the Title X client will reasonably construe them as professional advice to forgo her right to obtain an abortion. As would most rational patients, many of these women will follow that perceived advice and carry their pregnancy to term, despite their needs to the contrary and despite the safety of the abortion procedure for the vast majority of them. Others, delayed by the regulations' mandatory prenatal referral, will be prevented from acquiring abortions during the period in which the process is medically sound and constitutionally protected.
In view of the inevitable effect of the regulations, the majority's conclusion that ""[t]he difficulty that a woman encounters when a Title X project does not provide abortion counseling or referral leaves her in no different position than she would have been if the Government had not enacted Title X,"" ante, at 202, is insensitive and contrary to common human experience. Both the purpose and result of the challenged regulations are to deny women the ability voluntarily to decide their procreative destiny. For these women, the Government will have obliterated the freedom to choose as surely as if it had banned abortions outright. The denial of this freedom is not a consequence of poverty but of the Government's ill-intentioned distortion of information it has chosen to provide.[5]
*218 The substantial obstacles to bodily self-determination that the regulations impose are doubly offensive because they are effected by manipulating the very words spoken by physicians and counselors to their patients. In our society, the doctor-patient dialogue embodies a unique relationship of trust. The specialized nature of medical science and the emotional distress often attendant to health-related decisions requires that patients place their complete confidence, and often their very lives, in the hands of medical professionals. One seeks a physician's aid not only for medication or diagnosis, but also for guidance, professional judgment, and vital emotional support. Accordingly, each of us attaches profound importance and authority to the words of advice spoken by the physician.
It is for this reason that we have guarded so jealously the doctor-patient dialogue from governmental intrusion. ""[I]n Roe and subsequent cases we have `stressed repeatedly the central role of the physician, both in consulting with the woman about whether or not to have an abortion, and in determining how any abortion was to be carried out.'"" Akron, 462 U. S., at 447, quoting Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 387 (1979). See also Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 763. The majority's approval of the Secretary's regulations flies in the face of our repeated warnings that regulations tending to ""confine the attending physician in an undesired and uncomfortable straitjacket in the practice of his profession,"" cannot endure. Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 67, n. 8 (1976).
The majority attempts to distinguish our holdings in Akron and Thornburgh on the post hoc basis that the governmental *219 intrusions into the doctor-patient dialogue invalidated in those cases applied to all physicians within a jurisdiction while the regulations now before the Court pertain to the narrow class of health care professionals employed at Title X projects. Ante, at 202. But the rights protected by the Constitution are personal rights. Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967); Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 22 (1948). And for the individual woman, the deprivation of liberty by the Government is no less substantial because it affects few rather than many. It cannot be that an otherwise unconstitutional infringement of choice is made lawful because it touches only some of the Nation's pregnant women and not all of them.
The manipulation of the doctor-patient dialogue achieved through the Secretary's regulations is clearly an effort ""to deter a woman from making a decision that, with her physician, is hers to make."" Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 759. As such, it violates the Fifth Amendment.[6]

IV
In its haste further to restrict the right of every woman to control her reproductive freedom and bodily integrity, the majority disregards established principles of law and contorts this Court's decided cases to arrive at its preordained result. The majority professes to leave, undisturbed the free speech protections upon which our society has come to rely, but one must wonder what force the First Amendment retains if it is read to countenance the deliberate manipulation by the Government *220 of the dialogue between a woman and her physician, While technically leaving intact the fundamental right protected by Roe v. Wade, the Court, ""through a relentlessly formalistic catechism,"" McRae, 448 U. S., at 341 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), once again has rendered the right's substance nugatory. See Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S., at 537, 560 (opinions concurring in part and dissenting in part). This is a course nearly as noxious as overruling Roe directly, for if a right is found to be unenforceable, even against flagrant attempts by government to circumvent it, then it ceases to be a right at all. This, I fear, may be the effect of today's decision."
25704,Justice Rehnquist,majority,False,Rust v. Sullivan,,1991,1.0,"These cases concern a facial challenge to Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations which limit *178 the ability of Title X fund recipients to engage in abortion-related activities. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the regulations, finding them to be a permissible construction of the statute as well as consistent with the First and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution. We granted certiorari to resolve a split among the Courts of Appeals.[1] We affirm.

I

A
In 1970, Congress enacted Title X of the Public Health Service Act (Act), 84 Stat. 1506, as amended, 42 U.S. C. §§ 300 to 300a-6, which provides federal funding for family-planning services. The Act authorizes the Secretary to ""make grants to and enter into contracts with public or non-profit private entities to assist in the establishment and operation of voluntary family planning projects which shall offer a broad range of acceptable and effective family planning methods and services."" § 300(a). Grants and contracts under Title X must ""be made in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary may promulgate."" § 300a-4(a). Section 1008 of the Act, however, provides that ""[n]one of the funds appropriated under this subchapter shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning."" 42 U.S. C. § 300a-6. That restriction was intended to ensure that Title X funds would ""be used only to support preventive family *179 planning services, population research, infertility services, and other related medical, informational, and educational activities."" H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 91-1667, p. 8 (1970).
In 1988, the Secretary promulgated new regulations designed to provide ""`clear and operational guidance' to grantees about how to preserve the distinction between Title X programs and abortion as a method of family planning."" 53 Fed. Reg. 2923-2924 (1988). The regulations clarify, through the definition of the term ""family planning,"" that Congress intended Title X funds ""to be used only to support preventive family planning services."" H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 91-1667, p. 8 (emphasis added). Accordingly, Title X services are limited to ""preconceptional counseling, education, and general reproductive health care,"" and expressly exclude ""pregnancy care (including obstetric or prenatal care)."" 42 CFR § 59.2 (1989).[2] The regulations ""focus the emphasis of the Title X program on its traditional mission: The provision of preventive family planning services specifically designed to enable individuals to determine the number and spacing of their children, while clarifying that pregnant women must be referred to appropriate prenatal care services."" 53 Fed. Reg. 2925 (1988).
The regulations attach three principal conditions on the grant of federal funds for Title X projects. First, the regulations specify that a ""Title X project may not provide counseling concerning the use of abortion as a method of family planning or provide referral for abortion as a method of family planning."" 42 CFR § 59.8(a)(1) (1989). Because Title X is limited to preconceptional services, the program does not furnish services related to childbirth. Only in the context of a referral out of the Title X program is a pregnant woman given transitional information. § 59.8(a)(2). Title X *180 projects must refer every pregnant client ""for appropriate prenatal and/or social services by furnishing a list of available providers that promote the welfare of mother and unborn child."" Ibid. The list may not be used indirectly to encourage or promote abortion, ""such as by weighing the list of referrals in favor of health care providers which perform abortions, by including on the list of referral providers health care providers whose principal business is the provision of abortions, by excluding available providers who do not provide abortions, or by `steering' clients to providers who offer abortion as a method of family planning."" § 59.8(a)(3). The Title X project is expressly prohibited from referring a pregnant woman to an abortion provider, even upon specific request. One permissible response to such an inquiry is that ""the project does not consider abortion an appropriate method of family planning and therefore does not counsel or refer for abortion."" § 59.8(b)(5).
Second, the regulations broadly prohibit a Title X project from engaging in activities that ""encourage, promote or advocate abortion as a method of family planning."" § 59.10(a). Forbidden activities include lobbying for legislation that would increase the availability of abortion as a method of family planning, developing or disseminating materials advocating abortion as a method of family planning, providing speakers to promote abortion as a method of family planning, using legal action to make abortion available in any way as a method of family planning, and paying dues to any group that advocates abortion as a method of family planning as a substantial part of its activities. Ibid.
Third, the regulations require that Title X projects be organized so that they are ""physically and financially separate"" from prohibited abortion activities. § 59.9. To be deemed physically and financially separate, ""a Title X project must have an objective integrity and independence from prohibited activities. Mere bookkeeping separation of Title X funds from other monies is not sufficient."" Ibid. The regulations *181 provide a list of nonexclusive factors for the Secretary to consider in conducting a case-by-case determination of objective integrity and independence, such as the existence of separate accounting records and separate personnel, and the degree of physical separation of the project from facilities for prohibited activities. Ibid.

B
Petitioners are Title X grantees and doctors who supervise Title X funds suing on behalf of themselves and their patients. Respondent is the Secretary of HHS. After the regulations had been promulgated, but before they had been applied, petitioners filed two separate actions, later consolidated, challenging the facial validity of the regulations and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent implementation of the regulations. Petitioners challenged the regulations on the grounds that they were not authorized by Title X and that they violate the First and Fifth Amendment rights of Title X clients and the First Amendment rights of Title X health providers. After initially granting petitioners a preliminary injunction, the District Court rejected petitioners' statutory and constitutional challenges to the regulations and granted summary judgment in favor of the Secretary. New York v. Bowen, 690 F. Supp. 1261 (SDNY 1988).
A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. 889 F.2d 401 (1989). Applying this Court's decision in Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-843 (1984), the Court of Appeals determined that the regulations were a permissible construction of the statute that legitimately effectuated congressional intent. The court rejected as ""highly strained,"" petitioners' contention that the plain language of § 1008 forbids Title X projects only from performing abortions. The court reasoned that ""it would be wholly anomalous to read Section 1008 to mean that a program that merely counsels but does not perform abortions does not include abortion as a `method of family planning.'"" 889 F.2d, at 407. ""[T]he natural *182 construction of ... the term `method of family planning' includes counseling concerning abortion."" Ibid. The court found this construction consistent with the legislative history and observed that ""[a]ppellants' contrary view of the legislative history is based entirely on highly generalized statements about the expansive scope of the family planning services"" that ""do not specifically mention counseling concerning abortion as an intended service of Title X projects"" and that ""surely cannot be read to trump a section of the statute that specifically excludes it."" Id., at 407-408.
Turning to petitioners' constitutional challenges to the regulations, the Court of Appeals rejected petitioners' Fifth Amendment challenge. It held that the regulations do not impermissibly burden a woman's right to an abortion because the ""government may validly choose to favor childbirth over abortion and to implement that choice by funding medical services relating to childbirth but not those relating to abortion."" Id., at 410. Finding that the prohibition on the performance of abortions upheld by the Court in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490 (1989), was ""substantially greater in impact than the regulations challenged in the instant matter,"" 889 F.2d, at 411, the court concluded that the regulations ""create[d] no affirmative legal barriers to access to abortion."" Ibid., citing Webster v. Reproductive Health Services.
The court likewise found that the ""Secretary's implementation of Congress's decision not to fund abortion counseling, referral or advocacy also does not, under applicable Supreme Court precedent, constitute a facial violation of the First Amendment rights of health care providers or of women."" 889 F.2d, at 412. The court explained that under Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540 (1983), the Government has no obligation to subsidize even the exercise of fundamental rights, including ""speech rights."" The court also held that the regulations do not violate the First Amendment by ""condition[ing] receipt of a benefit on the *183 relinquishment of constitutional rights"" because Title X grantees and their employees ""remain free to say whatever they wish about abortion outside the Title X project."" 889 F.2d, at 412. Finally, the court rejected petitioners' contention that the regulations ""facially discriminate on the basis of the viewpoint of the speech involved."" Id., at 414.

II
We begin by pointing out the posture of the cases before us. Petitioners are challenging the facial validity of the regulations. Thus, we are concerned only with the question whether, on their face, the regulations are both authorized by the Act and can be construed in such a manner that they can be applied to a set of individuals without infringing upon constitutionally protected rights. Petitioners face a heavy burden in seeking to have the regulations invalidated as facially unconstitutional. ""A facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid. The fact that [the regulations] might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render [them] wholly invalid."" United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987).
We turn first to petitioners' contention that the regulations exceed the Secretary's authority under Title X and are arbitrary and capricious. We begin with an examination of the regulations concerning abortion counseling, referral, and advocacy, which every Court of Appeals has found to be authorized by the statute, and then turn to the ""program integrity requirement,"" with respect to which the courts below have adopted conflicting positions. We then address petitioners' claim that the regulations must be struck down because they raise a substantial constitutional question.


*184 A
We need not dwell on the plain language of the statute because we agree with every court to have addressed the issue that the language is ambiguous. The language of § 1008that ""[n]one of the funds appropriated under this subchapter shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning""does not speak directly to the issues of counseling, referral, advocacy, or program integrity. If a statute is ""silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute."" Chevron, 467 U. S., at 842-843.
The Secretary's construction of Title X may not be disturbed as an abuse of discretion if it reflects a plausible construction of the plain language of the statute and does not otherwise conflict with Congress' expressed intent. Ibid. In determining whether a construction is permissible, ""[t]he court need not conclude that the agency construction was the only one it permissibly could have adopted . . . or even the reading the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding."" Id., at 843, n. 11. Rather, substantial deference is accorded to the interpretation of the authorizing statute by the agency authorized with administering it. Id., at 844.
The broad language of Title X plainly allows the Secretary's construction of the statute. By its own terms, § 1008 prohibits the use of Title X funds ""in programs where abortion is a method of family planning."" Title X does not define the term ""method of family planning,"" nor does it enumerate what types of medical and counseling services are entitled to Title X funding. Based on the broad directives provided by Congress in Title X in general and § 1008 in particular, we are unable to say that the Secretary's construction of the prohibition in § 1008 to require a ban on counseling, referral, and advocacy within the Title X project is impermissible.
*185 The District Courts and Courts of Appeals that have examined the legislative history have all found, at least with regard to the Act's counseling, referral, and advocacy provisions, that the legislative history is ambiguous with respect to Congress' intent in enacting Title X and the prohibition of § 1008. Massachusetts v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 899 F.2d 53, 62 (CA1 1990) (""Congress has not addressed specifically the question of the scope of the abortion prohibition. The language of the statute and the legislative history can support either of the litigants' positions""); Planned Parenthood Federation of America v. Sullivan, 913 F.2d 1492, 1497 (CA10 1990) (""[T]he contemporaneous legislative history does not address whether clinics receiving Title X funds can engage in nondirective counseling including the abortion option and referrals""); 889 F.2d, at 407 (case below) (""Nothing in the legislative history of Title X detracts"" from the Secretary's construction of § 1008). We join these courts in holding that the legislative history is ambiguous and fails to shed light on relevant congressional intent. At no time did Congress directly address the issues of abortion counseling, referral, or advocacy. The parties' attempts to characterize highly generalized, conflicting statements in the legislative history into accurate revelations of congressional intent are unavailing.[3]
*186 When we find, as we do here, that the legislative history is ambiguous and unenlightening on the matters with respect to which the regulations deal, we customarily defer to the expertise of the agency. Petitioners argue, however, that the regulations are entitled to little or no deference because they ""reverse a longstanding agency policy that permitted nondirective counseling and referral for abortion,"" Brief for Petitioners in No. 89-1392, p. 20, and thus represent a sharp break from the Secretary's prior construction of the statute. Petitioners argue that the agency's prior consistent interpretation of § 1008 to permit nondirective counseling and to encourage coordination with local and state family planning services is entitled to substantial weight.
This Court has rejected the argument that an agency's interpretation ""is not entitled to deference because it represents a sharp break with prior interpretations"" of the statute in question. Chevron, 467 U. S., at 862. In Chevron, we held that a revised interpretation deserves deference because ""[a]n initial agency interpretation is not instantly carved in stone"" and ""the agency, to engage in informed rulemaking, must consider varying interpretations and the wisdom of its policy on a continuing basis."" Id., at 863-864. An agency is not required to ""`establish rules of conduct to last forever,'"" Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State *187 Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42 (1983), quoting American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 387 U.S. 397, 416 (1967); NLRB v. Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc., 494 U.S. 775 (1990), but rather ""must be given ample latitude to `adapt [its] rules and policies to the demands of changing circumstances.'"" Motor Vehicle Mfrs., supra, at 42, quoting Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U.S. 747, 784 (1968).
We find that the Secretary amply justified his change of interpretation with a ""reasoned analysis."" Motor Vehicle Mfrs., supra, at 42. The Secretary explained that the regulations are a result of his determination, in the wake of the critical reports of the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), that prior policy failed to implement properly the statute and that it was necessary to provide ""`clear and operational guidance' to grantees about how to preserve the distinction between Title X programs and abortion as a method of family planning."" 53 Fed. Reg. 2923-2924 (1988). He also determined that the new regulations are more in keeping with the original intent of the statute, are justified by client experience under the prior policy, and are supported by a shift in attitude against the ""elimination of unborn children by abortion."" We believe that these justifications are sufficient to support the Secretary's revised approach. Having concluded that the plain language and legislative history are ambiguous as to Congress' intent in enacting Title X, we must defer to the Secretary's permissible construction of the statute.

B
We turn next to the ""program integrity"" requirements embodied at § 59.9 of the regulations, mandating separate facilities, personnel, and records. These requirements are not inconsistent with the plain language of Title X. Petitioners contend, however, that they are based on an impermissible construction of the statute because they frustrate the clearly *188 expressed intent of Congress that Title X programs be an integral part of a broader, comprehensive, health-care system. They argue that this integration is impermissibly burdened because the efficient use of non-Title X funds by Title X grantees will be adversely affected by the regulations.
The Secretary defends the separation requirements of § 59.9 on the grounds that they are necessary to assure that Title X grantees apply federal funds only to federally authorized purposes and that grantees avoid creating the appearance that the Government is supporting abortion-related activities. The program integrity regulations were promulgated in direct response to the observations in the GAO and OIG reports that ""[b]ecause the distinction between the recipients' title X and other activities may not be easily recognized, the public can get the impression that Federal funds are being improperly used for abortion activities."" App. 85. The Secretary concluded:
""[M]eeting the requirement of section 1008 mandates that Title X programs be organized so that they are physically and financially separate from other activities which are prohibited from inclusion in a Title X program. Having a program that is separate from such activities is a necessary predicate to any determination that abortion is not being included as a method of family planning in the Title X program."" 53 Fed. Reg. 2940 (1988).
The Secretary further argues that the separation requirements do not represent a deviation from past policy because the agency has consistently taken the position that § 1008 requires some degree of physical and financial separation between Title X projects and abortion-related activities.
We agree that the program integrity requirements are based on a permissible construction of the statute and are not inconsistent with congressional intent. As noted, the legislative history is clear about very little, and program integrity is no exception. The statements relied upon by petitioners *189 to infer such an intent are highly generalized and do not directly address the scope of § 1008.
For example, the cornerstone of the conclusion that in Title X Congress intended a comprehensive, integrated system of family planning services is the statement in the statute requiring state health authorities applying for Title X funds to submit ""a State plan for a coordinated and comprehensive program of family planning services."" § 1002. This statement is, on its face, ambiguous as to Congress' intent in enacting Title X and the prohibition of § 1008. Placed in context, the statement merely requires that a state health authority submit a plan for a ""coordinated and comprehensive program of family planning services"" in order to be eligible for Title X funds. By its own terms, the language evinces Congress' intent to place a duty on state entities seeking federal funds; it does not speak either to an overall view of family planning services or to the Secretary's responsibility for implementing the statute. Likewise, the statement in the original House Report on Title X that the Act was ""not intended to interfere with or limit programs conducted in accordance with State or local laws"" and supported through non-Title X funds is equally unclear. H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 91-1667, pp. 8-9 (1970). This language directly follows the statement that it is the ""intent of both Houses that the funds authorized under this legislation be used only to support preventive family planning services.... The conferees have adopted the language contained in section 1008, which prohibits the use of such funds for abortion, in order to make this intent clear."" Id., at 8. When placed in context and read in light of the express prohibition of § 1008, the statements fall short of evidencing a congressional intent that would render the Secretary's interpretation of the statute impermissible.
While petitioners' interpretation of the legislative history may be a permissible one, it is by no means the only one, and it is certainly not the one found by the Secretary. It is well *190 established that legislative history which does not demonstrate a clear and certain congressional intent cannot form the basis for enjoining regulations. See Motor Vehicle Mfrs., 463 U. S., at 42. The Secretary based the need for the separation requirements ""squarely on the congressional intent that abortion not be a part of a Title X funded program."" 52 Fed. Reg. 33212 (1987). Indeed, if one thing is clear from the legislative history, it is that Congress intended that Title X funds be kept separate and distinct from abortion-related activities. It is undisputed that Title X was intended to provide primarily prepregnancy preventive services. Certainly the Secretary's interpretation of the statute that separate facilities are necessary, especially in light of the express prohibition of § 1008, cannot be judged unreasonable. Accordingly, we defer to the Secretary's reasoned determination that the program integrity requirements are necessary to implement the prohibition.
Petitioners also contend that the regulations must be invalidated because they raise serious questions of constitutional law. They rely on Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Construction Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568 (1988), and NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U.S. 490 (1979), which hold that ""an Act of Congress ought not be construed to violate the Constitution if any other possible construction remains available."" Id., at 500. Under this canon of statutory construction, ""`[t]he elementary rule is that every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.'"" DeBartolo Corp., supra, at 575 (emphasis added), quoting Hooper v. California, 155 U.S. 648, 657 (1895).
The principle enunciated in Hooper v. California, supra, and subsequent cases, is a categorical one: ""as between two possible interpretations of a statute, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and by the other valid, our plain duty is to adopt that which will save the Act."" Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 148 (1927) (opinion of Holmes, J.). This principle *191 is based at least in part on the fact that a decision to declare an Act of Congress unconstitutional ""is the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called on to perform."" Ibid. Following Hooper, supra, cases such as United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U.S. 366, 408 (1909), and United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U.S. 394, 401 (1916), developed the corollary doctrine that ""[a] statute must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional but also grave doubts upon that score."" This canon is followed out of respect for Congress, which we assume legislates in the light of constitutional limitations. FTC v. American Tobacco Co., 264 U.S. 298, 305-307 (1924). It is qualified by the proposition that ""avoidance of a difficulty will not be pressed to the point of disingenuous evasion."" George Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, 289 U.S. 373, 379 (1933).
Here Congress forbade the use of appropriated funds in programs where abortion is a method of family planning. It authorized the Secretary to promulgate regulations implementing this provision. The extensive litigation regarding governmental restrictions on abortion since our decision in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), suggests that it was likely that any set of regulations promulgated by the Secretaryother than the ones in force prior to 1988 and found by him to be relatively toothless and ineffectualwould be challenged on constitutional grounds. While we do not think that the constitutional arguments made by petitioners in these cases are without some force, in Part III, infra, we hold that they do not carry the day. Applying the canon of construction under discussion as best we can, we hold that the regulations promulgated by the Secretary do not raise the sort of ""grave and doubtful constitutional questions,"" Delaware & Hudson Co., supra, at 408, that would lead us to assume Congress did not intend to authorize their issuance. Therefore, we need not invalidate the regulations in order to save the statute from unconstitutionality.


*192 III
Petitioners contend that the regulations violate the First Amendment by impermissibly discriminating based on viewpoint because they prohibit ""all discussion about abortion as a lawful optionincluding counseling, referral, and the provision of neutral and accurate information about ending a pregnancywhile compelling the clinic or counselor to provide information that promotes continuing a pregnancy to term."" Brief for Petitioners in No. 89-1391, p. 11. They assert that the regulations violate the ""free speech rights of private health care organizations that receive Title X funds, of their staff, and of their patients"" by impermissibly imposing ""viewpoint-discriminatory conditions on government subsidies"" and thus ""penaliz[e] speech funded with non-Title X monies."" Id., at 13, 14, 24. Because ""Title X continues to fund speech ancillary to pregnancy testing in a manner that is not even-handed with respect to views and information about abortion, it invidiously discriminates on the basis of viewpoint."" Id., at 18. Relying on Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540 (1983), and Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 234 (1987), petitioners also assert that while the Government may place certain conditions on the receipt of federal subsidies, it may not ""discriminate invidiously in its subsidies in such a way as to `ai[m] at the suppression of dangerous ideas.'"" Regan, supra, at 548 (quoting Cammarano v. United States, 358 U.S. 498, 513 (1959)).
There is no question but that the statutory prohibition contained in § 1008 is constitutional. In Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464 (1977), we upheld a state welfare regulation under which Medicaid recipients received payments for services related to childbirth, but not for nontherapeutic abortions. The Court rejected the claim that this unequal subsidization worked a violation of the Constitution. We held that the government may ""make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion, and ... implement that judgment by the allocation *193 of public funds."" Id., at 474. Here the Government is exercising the authority it possesses under Maher and Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980), to subsidize family planning services which will lead to conception and childbirth, and declining to ""promote or encourage abortion."" The Government can, without violating the Constitution, selectively fund a program to encourage certain activities it believes to be in the public interest, without at the same time funding an alternative program which seeks to deal with the problem in another way. In so doing, the Government has not discriminated on the basis of viewpoint; it has merely chosen to fund one activity to the exclusion of the other. ""[A] legislature's decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right."" Regan, supra, at 549. See also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976); Cammarano v. United States, supra. ""A refusal to fund protected activity, without more, cannot be equated with the imposition of a `penalty' on that activity."" McRae, supra, at 317, n. 19. ""There is a basic difference between direct state interference with a protected activity and state encouragement of an alternative activity consonant with legislative policy."" Maher, supra, at 475.
The challenged regulations implement the statutory prohibition by prohibiting counseling, referral, and the provision of information regarding abortion as a method of family planning. They are designed to ensure that the limits of the federal program are observed. The Title X program is designed not for prenatal care, but to encourage family planning. A doctor who wished to offer prenatal care to a project patient who became pregnant could properly be prohibited from doing so because such service is outside the scope of the federally funded program. The regulations prohibiting abortion counseling and referral are of the same ilk; ""no funds appropriated for the project may be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning,"" and a doctor employed by the project may be prohibited in *194 the course of his project duties from counseling abortion or referring for abortion. This is not a case of the Government ""suppressing a dangerous idea,"" but of a prohibition on a project grantee or its employees from engaging in activities outside of the project's scope.
To hold that the Government unconstitutionally discriminates on the basis of viewpoint when it chooses to fund a program dedicated to advance certain permissible goals, because the program in advancing those goals necessarily discourages alternative goals, would render numerous Government programs constitutionally suspect. When Congress established a National Endowment for Democracy to encourage other countries to adopt democratic principles, 22 U.S. C. § 4411(b), it was not constitutionally required to fund a program to encourage competing lines of political philosophy such as communism and fascism. Petitioners' assertions ultimately boil down to the position that if the Government chooses to subsidize one protected right, it must subsidize analogous counterpart rights. But the Court has soundly rejected that proposition. Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., supra; Maher v. Roe, supra; Harris v. McRae, supra. Within far broader limits than petitioners are willing to concede, when the Government appropriates public funds to establish a program it is entitled to define the limits of that program.
We believe that petitioners' reliance upon our decision in Arkansas Writers' Project, supra, is misplaced. That case involved a state sales tax which discriminated between magazines on the basis of their content. Relying on this fact, and on the fact that the tax ""targets a small group within the press,"" contrary to our decision in Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575 (1983), the Court held the tax invalid. But we have here not the case of a general law singling out a disfavored group on the basis of speech content, but a case of the Government refusing *195 to fund activities, including speech, which are specifically excluded from the scope of the project funded.
Petitioners rely heavily on their claim that the regulations would not, in the circumstance of a medical emergency, permit a Title X project to refer a woman whose pregnancy places her life in imminent peril to a provider of abortions or abortion-related services. These cases, of course, involve only a facial challenge to the regulations, and we do not have before us any application by the Secretary to a specific fact situation. On their face, we do not read the regulations to bar abortion referral or counseling in such circumstances. Abortion counseling as a ""method of family planning"" is prohibited, and it does not seem that a medically necessitated abortion in such circumstances would be the equivalent of its use as a ""method of family planning."" Neither § 1008 nor the specific restrictions of the regulations would apply. Moreover, the regulations themselves contemplate that a Title X project would be permitted to engage in otherwise-prohibited, abortion-related activity in such circumstances. Section 59.8(a)(2) provides a specific exemption for emergency care and requires Title X recipients ""to refer the client immediately to an appropriate provider of emergency medical services."" 42 CFR § 59.8(a)(2) (1989). Section 59.5(b)(1) also requires Title X projects to provide ""necessary referral to other medical facilities when medically indicated.""[4]
*196 Petitioners also contend that the restrictions on the subsidization of abortion-related speech contained in the regulations are impermissible because they condition the receipt of a benefit, in these cases Title X funding, on the relinquishment of a constitutional right, the right to engage in abortion advocacy and counseling. Relying on Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972), and FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364 (1984), petitioners argue that ""even though the government may deny [a] ... benefit for any number of reasons, there are some reasons upon which the government may not rely. It may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interestsespecially, his interest in freedom of speech."" Perry, supra, at 597.
Petitioners' reliance on these cases is unavailing, however, because here the Government is not denying a benefit to anyone, but is instead simply insisting that public funds be spent for the purposes for which they were authorized. The Secretary's regulations do not force the Title X grantee to give up abortion-related speech; they merely require that the grantee keep such activities separate and distinct from Title X activities. Title X expressly distinguishes between a Title X grantee and a Title X project. The grantee, which normally is a health-care organization, may receive funds from a variety of sources for a variety of purposes. Brief for Petitioners in No. 89-1391, pp. 3, n. 5, 13. The grantee receives Title X funds, however, for the specific and limited purpose of establishing and operating a Title X project. 42 U.S. C. § 300(a). The regulations govern the scope of the Title X project's activities, and leave the grantee unfettered in its other activities. The Title X grantee can continue to perform abortions, provide abortion-related services, and engage in abortion advocacy; it simply is required to conduct those activities through programs that are separate and independent from the project that receives Title X funds. 42 CFR § 59.9 (1989).
*197 In contrast, our ""unconstitutional conditions"" cases involve situations in which the Government has placed a condition on the recipient of the subsidy rather than on a particular program or service, thus effectively prohibiting the recipient from engaging in the protected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program. In FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., we invalidated a federal law providing that noncommercial television and radio stations that receive federal grants may not ""engage in editorializing."" Under that law, a recipient of federal funds was ""barred absolutely from all editorializing"" because it ""is not able to segregate its activities according to the source of its funding"" and thus ""has no way of limiting the use of its federal funds to all noneditorializing activities."" The effect of the law was that ""a noncommercial educational station that receives only 1% of its overall income from [federal] grants is barred absolutely from all editorializing"" and ""barred from using even wholly private funds to finance its editorial activity."" 468 U.S., at 400. We expressly recognized, however, that were Congress to permit the recipient stations to ""establish `affiliate' organizations which could then use the station's facilities to editorialize with nonfederal funds, such a statutory mechanism would plainly be valid."" Ibid. Such a scheme would permit the station ""to make known its views on matters of public importance through its nonfederally funded, editorializing affiliate without losing federal grants for its noneditorializing broadcast activities."" Ibid.
Similarly, in Regan we held that Congress could, in the exercise of its spending power, reasonably refuse to subsidize the lobbying activities of tax-exempt charitable organizations by prohibiting such organizations from using tax-deductible contributions to support their lobbying efforts. In so holding, we explained that such organizations remained free ""to receive deductible contributions to support ... nonlobbying activit[ies]."" 461 U.S., at 545. Thus, a charitable organization could create, under § 501(c)(3) of the Internal *198 Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S. C. § 501(c)(3), an affiliate to conduct its nonlobbying activities using tax-deductible contributions, and at the same time establish, under § 501 (c)(4), a separate affiliate to pursue its lobbying efforts without such contributions. 461 U.S., at 544. Given that alternative, the Court concluded that ""Congress has not infringed any First Amendment rights or regulated any First Amendment activity[; it] has simply chosen not to pay for [appellee's] lobbying."" Id., at 546. We also noted that appellee ""would, of course, have to ensure that the § 501(c)(3) organization did not subsidize the § 501(c)(4) organization; otherwise, public funds might be spent on an activity Congress chose not to subsidize."" Id., at 544. The condition that federal funds will be used only to further the purposes of a grant does not violate constitutional rights. ""Congress could, for example, grant funds to an organization dedicated to combating teenage drug abuse, but condition the grant by providing that none of the money received from Congress should be used to lobby state legislatures."" See id., at 548.
By requiring that the Title X grantee engage in abortion-related activity separately from activity receiving federal funding, Congress has, consistent with our teachings in League of Women Voters and Regan, not denied it the right to engage in abortion-related activities. Congress has merely refused to fund such activities out of the public fisc, and the Secretary has simply required a certain degree of separation from the Title X project in order to ensure the integrity of the federally funded program.
The same principles apply to petitioners' claim that the regulations abridge the free speech rights of the grantee's staff. Individuals who are voluntarily employed for a Title X project must perform their duties in accordance with the regulation's restrictions on abortion counseling and referral. The employees remain free, however, to pursue abortion-related activities when they are not acting under the auspices of the Title X project. The regulations, which govern solely *199 the scope of the Title X project's activities, do not in any way restrict the activities of those persons acting as private individuals. The employees' freedom of expression is limited during the time that they actually work for the project; but this limitation is a consequence of their decision to accept employment in a project, the scope of which is permissibly restricted by the funding authority.[5]
This is not to suggest that funding by the Government, even when coupled with the freedom of the fund recipients to speak outside the scope of the Government-funded project, is invariably sufficient to justify Government control over the content of expression. For example, this Court has recognized *200 that the existence of a Government ""subsidy,"" in the form of Government-owned property, does not justify the restriction of speech in areas that have ""been traditionally open to the public for expressive activity,"" United States v. Kokinda, 497 U.S. 720, 726 (1990); Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496, 515 (1939) (opinion of Roberts, J.), or have been ""expressly dedicated to speech activity."" Kokinda, supra, at 726; Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983). Similarly, we have recognized that the university is a traditional sphere of free expression so fundamental to the functioning of our society that the Government's ability to control speech within that sphere by means of conditions attached to the expenditure of Government funds is restricted by the vagueness and overbreadth doctrines of the First Amendment, Keyishian v. Board of Regents, State Univ. of N. Y., 385 U.S. 589, 603, 605-606 (1967). It could be argued by analogy that traditional relationships such as that between doctor and patient should enjoy protection under the First Amendment from Government regulation, even when subsidized by the Government. We need not resolve that question here, however, because the Title X program regulations do not significantly impinge upon the doctor-patient relationship. Nothing in them requires a doctor to represent as his own any opinion that he does not in fact hold. Nor is the doctor-patient relationship established by the Title X program sufficiently all encompassing so as to justify an expectation on the part of the patient of comprehensive medical advice. The program does not provide postconception medical care, and therefore a doctor's silence with regard to abortion cannot reasonably be thought to mislead a client into thinking that the doctor does not consider abortion an appropriate option for her. The doctor is always free to make clear that advice regarding abortion is simply beyond the scope of the program. In these circumstances, the general rule that the Government may choose not to subsidize speech applies with full force.


*201 IV
We turn now to petitioners' argument that the regulations violate a woman's Fifth Amendment right to choose whether to terminate her preguancy. We recently reaffirmed the long-recognized principle that ""`the Due Process Clauses generally confer no affirmative right to governmental aid, even where such aid may be necessary to secure life, liberty, or property interests of which the government itself may not deprive the individual.'"" Webster, 492 U. S., at 507, quoting DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services, 489 U.S. 189, 196 (1989). The Government has no constitutional duty to subsidize an activity merely because the activity is constitutionally protected and may validly choose to fund childbirth over abortion and ""`implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds'"" for medical services relating to childbirth but not to those relating to abortion. Webster, supra, at 510 (citation omitted). The Government has no affirmative duty to ""commit any resources to facilitating abortions,"" Webster, 492 U. S., at 511, and its decision to fund childbirth but not abortion ""places no governmental obstacle in the path of a woman who chooses to terminate her pregnancy, but rather, by means of unequal subsidization of abortion and other medical services, encourages alternative activity deemed in the public interest."" McRae, 448 U. S., at 315.
That the regulations do not impermissibly burden a woman's Fifth Amendment rights is evident from the line of cases beginning with Maher and McRae and culminating in our most recent decision in Webster. Just as Congress' refusal to fund abortions in McRae left ""an indigent woman with at least the same range of choice in deciding whether to obtain a medically necessary abortion as she would have had if Congress had chosen to subsidize no health care costs at all,"" 448 U.S., at 317, and ""Missouri's refusal to allow public employees to perform abortions in public hospitals leaves a pregnant woman with the same choices as if the State had chosen not *202 to operate any public hospitals,"" Webster, supra, at 509, Congress' refusal to fund abortion counseling and advocacy leaves a pregnant woman with the same choices as if the Government had chosen not to fund family-planning services at all. The difficulty that a woman encounters when a Title X project does not provide abortion counseling or referral leaves her in no different position than she would have been if the Government had not enacted Title X.
In Webster, we stated that ""[h]aving held that the State's refusal [in Maher] to fund abortions does not violate Roe v. Wade, it strains logic to reach a contrary result for the use of public facilities and employees."" 492 U.S., at 509-510. It similarly would strain logic, in light of the more extreme restrictions in those cases, to find that the mere decision to exclude abortion-related services from a federally funded preconceptional family planning program is unconstitutional.
Petitioners also argue that by impermissibly infringing on the doctor-patient relationship and depriving a Title X client of information concerning abortion as a method of family planning, the regulations violate a woman's Fifth Amendment right to medical self-determination and to make informed medical decisions free of government-imposed harm. They argue that under our decisions in Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416 (1983), and Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747 (1986), the Government cannot interfere with a woman's right to make an informed and voluntary choice by placing restrictions on the patient-doctor dialogue.
In Akron, we invalidated a city ordinance requiring all physicians to make specified statements to the patient prior to performing an abortion in order to ensure that the woman's consent was ""truly informed."" 462 U.S., at 423. Similarly, in Thornburgh, we struck down a state statute mandating that a list of agencies offering alternatives to abortion and a description of fetal development be provided to every woman considering terminating her pregnancy through an *203 abortion. Critical to our decisions in Akron and Thornburgh to invalidate a governmental intrusion into the patient-doctor dialogue was the fact that the laws in both cases required all doctors within their respective jurisdictions to provide all pregnant patients contemplating an abortion a litany of information, regardless of whether the patient sought the information or whether the doctor thought the information necessary to the patient's decision. Under the Secretary's regulations, however, a doctor's ability to provide, and a woman's right to receive, information concerning abortion and abortion-related services outside the context of the Title X project remains unfettered. It would undoubtedly be easier for a woman seeking an abortion if she could receive information about abortion from a Title X project, but the Constitution does not require that the Government distort the scope of its mandated program in order to provide that information.
Petitioners contend, however, that most Title X clients are effectively precluded by indigency and poverty from seeing a health-care provider who will provide abortion-related services. But once again, even these Title X clients are in no worse position than if Congress had never enacted Title X. ""The financial constraints that restrict an indigent woman's ability to enjoy the full range of constitutionally protected freedom of choice are the product not of governmental restrictions on access to abortion, but rather of her indigency."" McRae, supra, at 316.
The Secretary's regulations are a permissible construction of Title X and do not violate either the First or Fifth Amendments to the Constitution. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Affirmed."
25706,Justice Stevens,second_dissenting,False,Rust v. Sullivan,,1991,1.0,"In my opinion, the Court has not paid sufficient attention to the language of the controlling statute or to the consistent interpretation accorded the statute by the responsible cabinet officers during four different Presidencies and 18 years.
The relevant text of the ""Family Planning Services and Population Research Act of 1970"" has remained unchanged since its enactment. 84 Stat. 1504. The preamble to the Act states that it was passed:
""To promote public health and welfare by expanding, improving, and better coordinating the family planning services and population research activities of the Federal Government, and for other purposes."" Ibid.

The declaration of congressional purposes emphasizes the importance of educating the public about family planning services. Thus, § 2 of the Act states, in part, that the purpose of the Act is:
""(1) to assist in making comprehensive voluntary family planning services readily available to all persons desiring such services;
. . . . .
""(5) to develop and make readily available information (including educational materials) on family planning and *221 population growth to all persons desiring such information."" 42 U.S. C. § 300 (Congressional Declaration of Purpose).
In contrast to the statutory emphasis on making relevant information readily available to the public, the statute contains no suggestion that Congress intended to authorize the suppression or censorship of any information by any Government employee or by any grant recipient.
Section 6 of the Act authorizes the provision of federal funds to support the establishment and operation of voluntary family planning projects. The section also empowers the Secretary to promulgate regulations imposing conditions on grant recipients to ensure that ""such grants will be effectively utilized for the purposes for which made."" § 300a-4(b). Not a word in the statute, however, authorizes the Secretary to impose any restrictions on the dissemination of truthful information or professional advice by grant recipients.
The word ""prohibition"" is used only once in the Act. Section 6, which adds to the Public Health Service Act the new Title X, covering the subject of population research and voluntary planning programs, includes the following provision:
""PROHIBITION OF ABORTION
""SEC. 1008. None of the funds appropriated under this title shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning."" 84 Stat. 1508, 42 U.S. C. § 300a-6.
Read in the context of the entire statute, this prohibition is plainly directed at conduct, rather than the dissemination of information or advice, by potential grant recipients.
The original regulations promulgated in 1971 by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare so interpreted the statute. This ""`contemporaneous construction of [the] statute by the men charged with the responsibility of setting its machinery in motion'"" is entitled to particular respect. See Power Reactor Development Co. v. Electrical Workers, 367 *222 U. S. 396, 408 (1961); Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16 (1965); Aluminum Co. of America v. Central Lincoln Peoples' Utility Dist., 467 U.S. 380, 390 (1984). The regulations described the kind of services that grant recipients had to provide in order to be eligible for federal funding, but they did not purport to regulate or restrict the kinds of advice or information that recipients might make available to their clients. Conforming to the language of the governing statute, the regulations provided that ""[t]he project will not provide abortions as a method of family planning."" 42 CFR § 59.5(a)(9) (1972) (emphasis added). Like the statute itself, the regulations prohibited conduct, not speech.
The same is true of the regulations promulgated in 1986 by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. They also prohibited grant recipients from performing abortions but did not purport to censor or mandate any kind of speech. See 42 CFR §§ 59.1-59.13 (1986).
The entirely new approach adopted by the Secretary in 1988 was not, in my view, authorized by the statute. The new regulations did not merely reflect a change in a policy determination that the Secretary had been authorized by Congress to make. Cf. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 865 (1984). Rather, they represented an assumption of policy-making responsibility that Congress had not delegated to the Secretary. See id., at 842-843 (""If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress""). In a society that abhors censorship and in which policymakers have traditionally placed the highest value on the freedom to communicate, it is unrealistic to conclude that statutory authority to regulate conduct implicitly authorized the Executive to regulate speech.
Because I am convinced that the 1970 Act did not authorize the Secretary to censor the speech of grant recipients or their *223 employees, I would hold the challenged regulations invalid and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
Even if I thought the statute were ambiguous, however, I would reach the same result for the reasons stated in JUSTICE O'CONNOR's dissenting opinion. As she also explains, if a majority of the Court had reached this result, it would be improper to comment on the constitutional issues that the parties have debated. Because the majority has reached out to decide the constitutional questions, however, I am persuaded that JUSTICE BLACKMUN is correct in concluding that the majority's arguments merit a response. I am also persuaded that JUSTICE BLACKMUN has correctly analyzed these issues. I have therefore joined Parts II and III of his opinion.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, dissenting.
""[W]here an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress."" Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Construction Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988). JUSTICE BLACKMUN has explained well why this longstanding canon of statutory construction applies in these cases, and I join Part I of his dissent. Part II demonstrates why the challenged regulations, which constitute the Secretary's interpretation of § 1008 of the Public Health Service Act, 84 Stat. 1508, 42 U.S. C. § 300a-6, ""raise serious constitutional problems"": the regulations place content-based restrictions on the speech of Title X fund recipients, restrictions directed precisely at speech concerning one of ""the most divisive and contentious issues that our Nation has faced in recent years."" Ante, at 215.
One may well conclude, as JUSTICE BLACKMUN does in Part II, that the regulations are unconstitutional for this reason. I do not join Part II of the dissent, however, for the same reason that I do not join Part III, in which JUSTICE *224 BLACKMUN concludes that the regulations are unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment. The canon of construction that JUSTICE BLACKMUN correctly applies here is grounded in large part upon our time-honored practice of not reaching constitutional questions unnecessarily. See DeBartolo, supra, at 575. ""It is a fundamental rule of judicial restraint... that this Court will not reach constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them."" Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C., 467 U.S. 138, 157 (1984). See also Alexander v. Louisiana, 405 U.S. 625, 633 (1972); Burton v. United States, 196 U.S. 283, 295 (1905); Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S. S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113 U.S. 33, 39 (1885) (In the exercise of its jurisdiction to pronounce unconstitutional laws of the United States, this Court ""has rigidly adhered"" to the rule ""never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it"").
This Court acts at the limits of its power when it invalidates a law on constitutional grounds. In recognition of our place in the constitutional scheme, we must act with ""great gravity and delicacy"" when telling a coordinate branch that its actions are absolutely prohibited absent constitutional amendment. Adkins v. Children's Hospital of District of Columbia, 261 U.S. 525, 544 (1923). See also Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 147-148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring). In these cases, we need only tell the Secretary that his regulations are not a reasonable interpretation of the statute; we need not tell Congress that it cannot pass such legislation. If we rule solely on statutory grounds, Congress retains the power to force the constitutional question by legislating more explicitly. It may instead choose to do nothing. That decision should be left to Congress; we should not tell Congress what it cannot do before it has chosen to do it. It is enough in this litigation to conclude that neither the language nor the history of § 1008 compels the Secretary's interpretation, *225 and that the interpretation raises serious First Amendment concerns. On this basis alone, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and invalidate the challenged regulations.
"
13312,Justice Ginsburg,majority,False,United States v. Virginia,,1996,2.0,"Virginia's public institutions of higher learning include an incomparable military college, Virginia Military Institute (VMI). The United States maintains that the Constitution's equal protection guarantee precludes Virginia from reserving exclusively to men the unique educational opportunities VMI affords. We agree.


*520 I
Founded in 1839, VMI is today the sole single-sex school among Virginia's 15 public institutions of higher learning. VMI's distinctive mission is to produce ""citizen-soldiers,"" men prepared for leadership in civilian life and in military service. VMI pursues this mission through pervasive training of a kind not available anywhere else in Virginia. Assigning prime place to character development, VMI uses an ""adversative method"" modeled on English public schools and once characteristic of military instruction. VMI constantly endeavors to instill physical and mental discipline in its cadets and impart to them a strong moral code. The school's graduates leave VMI with heightened comprehension of their capacity to deal with duress and stress, and a large sense of accomplishment for completing the hazardous course.
VMI has notably succeeded in its mission to produce leaders; among its alumni are military generals, Members of Congress, and business executives. The school's alumni overwhelmingly perceive that their VMI training helped them to realize their personal goals. VMI's endowment reflects the loyalty of its graduates; VMI has the largest per-student endowment of all public undergraduate institutions in the Nation.
Neither the goal of producing citizen-soldiers nor VMI's implementing methodology is inherently unsuitable to women. And the school's impressive record in producing leaders has made admission desirable to some women. Nevertheless, Virginia has elected to preserve exclusively for men the advantages and opportunities a VMI education affords.

II

A
From its establishment in 1839 as one of the Nation's first state military colleges, see 1839 Va. Acts, ch. 20, VMI has remained financially supported by Virginia and ""subject to *521 the control of the [Virginia] General Assembly,"" Va. Code Ann. § 23-92 (1993). First southern college to teach engineering and industrial chemistry, see H. Wise, Drawing Out the Man: The VMI Story 13 (1978) (The VMI Story), VMI once provided teachers for the Commonwealth's schools, see 1842 Va. Acts, ch. 24, § 2 (requiring every cadet to teach in one of the Commonwealth's schools for a 2-year period).[1] Civil War strife threatened the school's vitality, but a resourceful superintendent regained legislative support by highlighting ""VMI's great potential[,] through its technical know-how,"" to advance Virginia's postwar recovery. The VMI Story 47.
VMI today enrolls about 1,300 men as cadets.[2] Its academic offerings in the liberal arts, sciences, and engineering are also available at other public colleges and universities in Virginia. But VMI's mission is special. It is the mission of the school
""`to produce educated and honorable men, prepared for the varied work of civil life, imbued with love of learning, confident in the functions and attitudes of leadership, possessing a high sense of public service, advocates of the American democracy and free enterprise system, and ready as citizen-soldiers to defend their country in *522 time of national peril.' "" 766 F. Supp. 1407, 1425 (WD Va. 1991) (quoting Mission Study Committee of the VMI Board of Visitors, Report, May 16, 1986).
In contrast to the federal service academies, institutions maintained ""to prepare cadets for career service in the armed forces,"" VMI's program ""is directed at preparation for both military and civilian life""; ""[o]nly about 15% of VMI cadets enter career military service."" 766 F. Supp., at 1432.
VMI produces its ""citizen-soldiers"" through ""an adversative, or doubting, model of education"" which features ""[p]hysical rigor, mental stress, absolute equality of treatment, absence of privacy, minute regulation of behavior, and indoctrination in desirable values."" Id., at 1421. As one Commandant of Cadets described it, the adversative method ""`dissects the young student,' "" and makes him aware of his ""`limits and capabilities,' "" so that he knows ""`how far he can go with his anger, . . . how much he can take under stress, . . . exactly what he can do when he is physically exhausted.' "" Id. , at 1421-1422 (quoting Col. N. Bissell).
VMI cadets live in spartan barracks where surveillance is constant and privacy nonexistent; they wear uniforms, eat together in the mess hall, and regularly participate in drills. Id. , at 1424, 1432. Entering students are incessantly exposed to the rat line, ""an extreme form of the adversative model,"" comparable in intensity to Marine Corps boot camp. Id. , at 1422. Tormenting and punishing, the rat line bonds new cadets to their fellow sufferers and, when they have completed the 7-month experience, to their former tormentors. Ibid. 
VMI's ""adversative model"" is further characterized by a hierarchical ""class system"" of privileges and responsibilities, a ""dyke system"" for assigning a senior class mentor to each entering class ""rat,"" and a stringently enforced ""honor code,"" which prescribes that a cadet ""`does not lie, cheat, steal nor tolerate those who do.' "" Id. , at 1422-1423.
*523 VMI attracts some applicants because of its reputation as an extraordinarily challenging military school, and ""because its alumni are exceptionally close to the school."" Id. , at 1421. ""[W]omen have no opportunity anywhere to gain the benefits of [the system of education at VMI]."" Ibid.

In 1990, prompted by a complaint filed with the Attorney General by a female high-school student seeking admission to VMI, the United States sued the Commonwealth of Virginia and VMI, alleging that VMI's exclusively male admission policy violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. , at 1408.[3] Trial of the action consumed six days and involved an array of expert witnesses on each side. Ibid. 
In the two years preceding the lawsuit, the District Court noted, VMI had received inquiries from 347 women, but had responded to none of them. Id. , at 1436. ""[S]ome women, at least,"" the court said, ""would want to attend the school if they had the opportunity."" Id. , at 1414. The court further recognized that, with recruitment, VMI could ""achieve at least 10% female enrollment""""a sufficient `critical mass' to provide the female cadets with a positive educational experience."" Id. , at 1437-1438. And it was also established that ""some women are capable of all of the individual activities required of VMI cadets."" Id. , at 1412. In addition, experts agreed that if VMI admitted women, ""the VMI ROTC experience would become a better training program from the perspective of the armed forces, because it would provide training in dealing with a mixed-gender army."" Id. , at 1441.
The District Court ruled in favor of VMI, however, and rejected the equal protection challenge pressed by the United States. That court correctly recognized that Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718 (1982), was *524 the closest guide. 766 F. Supp., at 1410. There, this Court underscored that a party seeking to uphold government action based on sex must establish an ""exceedingly persuasive justification"" for the classification. Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at 724 (internal quotation marks omitted). To succeed, the defender of the challenged action must show ""at least that the classification serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives."" Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).
The District Court reasoned that education in ""a singlegender environment, be it male or female,"" yields substantial benefits. 766 F. Supp., at 1415. VMI's school for men brought diversity to an otherwise coeducational Virginia system, and that diversity was ""enhanced by VMI's unique method of instruction."" Ibid. If single-gender education for males ranks as an important governmental objective, it becomes obvious, the District Court concluded, that the only  means of achieving the objective ""is to exclude women from the all-male institutionVMI."" Ibid. 
""Women are [indeed] denied a unique educational opportunity that is available only at VMI,"" the District Court acknowledged. Id. , at 1432. But ""[VMI's] single-sex status would be lost, and some aspects of the [school's] distinctive method would be altered,"" if women were admitted, id. , at 1413: ""Allowance for personal privacy would have to be made,"" id. , at 1412; ""[p]hysical education requirements would have to be altered, at least for the women,"" id. , at 1413; the adversative environment could not survive unmodified, id. , at 1412-1413. Thus, ""sufficient constitutional justification"" had been shown, the District Court held, ""for continuing [VMI's] single-sex policy."" Id. , at 1413.
The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit disagreed and vacated the District Court's judgment. The appellate court held: ""The Commonwealth of Virginia has not . . . advanced any state policy by which it can justify its determination, *525 under an announced policy of diversity, to afford VMI's unique type of program to men and not to women."" 976 F.2d 890, 892 (1992).
The appeals court greeted with skepticism Virginia's assertion that it offers single-sex education at VMI as a facet of the Commonwealth's overarching and undisputed policy to advance ""autonomy and diversity."" The court underscored Virginia's nondiscrimination commitment: ""`[I]t is extremely important that [colleges and universities] deal with faculty, staff, and students without regard to sex, race, or ethnic origin. ` "" Id. , at 899 (quoting 1990 Report of the Virginia Commission on the University of the 21st Century). ""That statement,"" the Court of Appeals said, ""is the only explicit one that we have found in the record in which the Commonwealth has expressed itself with respect to gender distinctions."" 976 F.2d, at 899. Furthermore, the appeals court observed, in urging ""diversity"" to justify an all-male VMI, the Commonwealth had supplied ""no explanation for the movement away from [single-sex education] in Virginia by public colleges and universities."" Ibid. In short, the court concluded, ""[a] policy of diversity which aims to provide an array of educational opportunities, including single-gender institutions, must do more than favor one gender."" Ibid. 
The parties agreed that ""some women can meet the physical standards now imposed on men,"" id. , at 896, and the court was satisfied that ""neither the goal of producing citizen soldiers nor VMI's implementing methodology is inherently unsuitable to women,"" id. , at 899. The Court of Appeals, however, accepted the District Court's finding that ""at least these three aspects of VMI's programphysical training, the absence of privacy, and the adversative approachwould be materially affected by coeducation."" Id. , at 896-897. Remanding the case, the appeals court assigned to Virginia, in the first instance, responsibility for selecting a remedial course. The court suggested these options for the Commonwealth: Admit women to VMI; establish parallel institutions *526 or programs; or abandon state support, leaving VMI free to pursue its policies as a private institution. Id. , at 900. In May 1993, this Court denied certiorari. See 508 U.S. 946; see also ibid. (opinion of Scalia, J., noting the interlocutory posture of the litigation).

C
In response to the Fourth Circuit's ruling, Virginia proposed a parallel program for women: Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership (VWIL). The 4-year, state-sponsored undergraduate program would be located at Mary Baldwin College, a private liberal arts school for women, and would be open, initially, to about 25 to 30 students. Although VWIL would share VMI's missionto produce ""citizensoldiers""the VWIL program would differ, as does Mary Baldwin College, from VMI in academic offerings, methods of education, and financial resources. See 852 F. Supp. 471, 476-477 (WD Va. 1994).
The average combined SAT score of entrants at Mary Baldwin is about 100 points lower than the score for VMI freshmen. See id., at 501. Mary Baldwin's faculty holds ""significantly fewer Ph. D.'s than the faculty at VMI,"" id. , at 502, and receives significantly lower salaries, see Tr. 158 (testimony of James Lott, Dean of Mary Baldwin College), reprinted in 2 App. in Nos. 94-1667 and 94-1717 (CA4) (hereinafter Tr.). While VMI offers degrees in liberal arts, the sciences, and engineering, Mary Baldwin, at the time of trial, offered only bachelor of arts degrees. See 852 F. Supp., at 503. A VWIL student seeking to earn an engineering degree could gain one, without public support, by attending Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, for two years, paying the required private tuition. See ibid. 
Experts in educating women at the college level composed the Task Force charged with designing the VWIL program; Task Force members were drawn from Mary Baldwin's own faculty and staff. Id. , at 476. Training its attention on methods of instruction appropriate for ""most women,"" the *527 Task Force determined that a military model would be ""wholly inappropriate"" for VWIL. Ibid.; see 44 F.3d 1229, 1233 (CA4 1995).
VWIL students would participate in ROTC programs and a newly established, ""largely ceremonial"" Virginia Corps of Cadets, id. , at 1234, but the VWIL House would not have a military format, 852 F. Supp., at 477, and VWIL would not require its students to eat meals together or to wear uniforms during the schoolday, id., at 495. In lieu of VMI's adversative method, the VWIL Task Force favored ""a cooperative method which reinforces self-esteem."" Id., at 476. In addition to the standard bachelor of arts program offered at Mary Baldwin, VWIL students would take courses in leadership, complete an off-campus leadership externship, participate in community service projects, and assist in arranging a speaker series. See 44 F.3d, at 1234.
Virginia represented that it will provide equal financial support for in-state VWIL students and VMI cadets, 852 F. Supp., at 483, and the VMI Foundation agreed to supply a $5.4625 million endowment for the VWIL program, id., at 499. Mary Baldwin's own endowment is about $19 million; VMI's is $131 million. Id., at 503. Mary Baldwin will add $35 million to its endowment based on future commitments; VMI will add $220 million. Ibid. The VMI Alumni Association has developed a network of employers interested in hiring VMI graduates. The Association has agreed to open its network to VWIL graduates, id., at 499, but those graduates will not have the advantage afforded by a VMI degree.

D
Virginia returned to the District Court seeking approval of its proposed remedial plan, and the court decided the plan met the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause. Id. , at 473. The District Court again acknowledged evidentiary support for these determinations: ""[T]he VMI methodology could be used to educate women and, in fact, some *528 women . . . may prefer the VMI methodology to the VWIL methodology."" Id. , at 481. But the ""controlling legal principles,"" the District Court decided, ""do not require the Commonwealth to provide a mirror image VMI for women."" Ibid. The court anticipated that the two schools would ""achieve substantially similar outcomes."" Ibid. It concluded: ""If VMI marches to the beat of a drum, then Mary Baldwin marches to the melody of a fife and when the march is over, both will have arrived at the same destination."" Id. , at 484.
A divided Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's judgment. 44 F.3d 1229 (CA4 1995). This time, the appellate court determined to give ""greater scrutiny to the selection of means than to the [Commonwealth's] proffered objective."" Id. , at 1236. The official objective or purpose, the court said, should be reviewed deferentially. Ibid. Respect for the ""legislative will,"" the court reasoned, meant that the judiciary should take a ""cautious approach,"" inquiring into the ""legitima[cy]"" of the governmental objective and refusing approval for any purpose revealed to be ""pernicious."" Ibid. 
""[P]roviding the option of a single-gender college education may be considered a legitimate and important aspect of a public system of higher education,"" the appeals court observed, id., at 1238; that objective, the court added, is ""not pernicious,"" id., at 1239. Moreover, the court continued, the adversative method vital to a VMI education ""has never been tolerated in a sexually heterogeneous environment."" Ibid. The method itself ""was not designed to exclude women,"" the court noted, but women could not be accommodated in the VMI program, the court believed, for female participation in VMI's adversative training ""would destroy. . . any sense of decency that still permeates the relationship between the sexes."" Ibid. 
Having determined, deferentially, the legitimacy of Virginia's purpose, the court considered the question of means. *529 Exclusion of ""men at Mary Baldwin College and women at VMI,"" the court said, was essential to Virginia's purpose, for without such exclusion, the Commonwealth could not ""accomplish [its] objective of providing single-gender education."" Ibid. 
The court recognized that, as it analyzed the case, means merged into end, and the merger risked ""bypass[ing] any equal protection scrutiny."" Id., at 1237. The court therefore added another inquiry, a decisive test it called ""substantive comparability."" Ibid. The key question, the court said, was whether men at VMI and women at VWIL would obtain ""substantively comparable benefits at their institution or through other means offered by the [S]tate."" Ibid. Although the appeals court recognized that the VWIL degree ""lacks the historical benefit and prestige"" of a VMI degree, it nevertheless found the educational opportunities at the two schools ""sufficiently comparable."" Id., at 1241.
Senior Circuit Judge Phillips dissented. The court, in his judgment, had not held Virginia to the burden of showing an ""`exceedingly persuasive [justification]' "" for the Commonwealth's action. Id., at 1247 (quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at 724). In Judge Phillips' view, the court had accepted ""rationalizations compelled by the exigencies of this litigation,"" and had not confronted the Commonwealth's ""actual overriding purpose."" 44 F.3d, at 1247. That purpose, Judge Phillips said, was clear from the historical record; it was ""not to create a new type of educational opportunity for women, . . . nor to further diversify the Commonwealth's higher education system[,] . . . but [was] simply . . . to allow VMI to continue to exclude women in order to preserve its historic character and mission."" Ibid. 
Judge Phillips suggested that the Commonwealth would satisfy the Constitution's equal protection requirement if it ""simultaneously opened single-gender undergraduate institutions having substantially comparable curricular and extra-curricular programs, funding, physical plant, administration *530 and support services, and faculty and library resources."" Id., at 1250. But he thought it evident that the proposed VWIL program, in comparison to VMI, fell ""far short . . . from providing substantially equal tangible and intangible educational benefits to men and women."" Ibid. 
The Fourth Circuit denied rehearing en banc. 52 F.3d 90 (1995). Circuit Judge Motz, joined by Circuit Judges Hall, Murnaghan, and Michael, filed a dissenting opinion.[4] Judge Motz agreed with Judge Phillips that Virginia had not shown an ""`exceedingly persuasive justification' "" for the disparate opportunities the Commonwealth supported. Id., at 92 (quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at 724). She asked: ""[H]ow can a degree from a yet to be implemented supplemental program at Mary Baldwin be held `substantively comparable' to a degree from a venerable Virginia military institution that was established more than 150 years ago?"" 52 F.3d, at 93. ""Women need not be guaranteed equal `results,' "" Judge Motz said, ""but the Equal Protection Clause does require equal opportunity . . . [and] that opportunity is being denied here."" Ibid. 

III
The cross-petitions in this suit present two ultimate issues. First, does Virginia's exclusion of women from the educational opportunities provided by VMIextraordinary opportunities for military training and civilian leadership developmentdeny to women ""capable of all of the individual activities required of VMI cadets,"" 766 F. Supp., at 1412, the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment? Second, if VMI's ""unique"" situation, id. , at 1413as Virginia's sole single-sex public institution of *531 higher educationoffends the Constitution's equal protection principle, what is the remedial requirement?

IV
We note, once again, the core instruction of this Court's pathmarking decisions in J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B.,  511 U.S. 127, 136-137, and n. 6 (1994), and Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at 724 (internal quotation marks omitted): Parties who seek to defend gender-based government action must demonstrate an ""exceedingly persuasive justification"" for that action.
Today's skeptical scrutiny of official action denying rights or opportunities based on sex responds to volumes of history. As a plurality of this Court acknowledged a generation ago, ""our Nation has had a long and unfortunate history of sex discrimination."" Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 684 (1973). Through a century plus three decades and more of that history, women did not count among voters composing ""We the People"";[5] not until 1920 did women gain a constitutional right to the franchise. Id., at 685. And for a half century thereafter, it remained the prevailing doctrine that government, both federal and state, could withhold from women opportunities accorded men so long as any ""basis in reason"" could be conceived for the discrimination. See, e. g., Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U.S. 464, 467 (1948) (rejecting challenge of female tavern owner and her daughter to Michigan law denying bartender licenses to femalesexcept for wives and daughters of male tavern owners; Court would not ""give ear"" to the contention that ""an unchivalrous desire of male *532 bartenders to . . . monopolize the calling"" prompted the legislation).
In 1971, for the first time in our Nation's history, this Court ruled in favor of a woman who complained that her State had denied her the equal protection of its laws. Reed  v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 73 (holding unconstitutional Idaho Code prescription that, among ""`several persons claiming and equally entitled to administer [a decedent's estate], males must be preferred to females' ""). Since Reed, the Court has repeatedly recognized that neither federal nor state government acts compatibly with the equal protection principle when a law or official policy denies to women, simply because they are women, full citizenship statureequal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society based on their individual talents and capacities. See, e. g., Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U.S. 455, 462-463 (1981) (affirming invalidity of Louisiana law that made husband ""head and master"" of property jointly owned with his wife, giving him unilateral right to dispose of such property without his wife's consent); Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U.S. 7 (1975) (invalidating Utah requirement that parents support boys until age 21, girls only until age 18).
Without equating gender classifications, for all purposes, to classifications based on race or national origin,[6] the Court, in post-Reed decisions, has carefully inspected official action that closes a door or denies opportunity to women (or to men). See J. E. B. , 511 U. S., at 152 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (case law evolving since 1971 ""reveal[s] a strong presumption that gender classifications are invalid""). To summarize the Court's current directions for cases of official classification based on gender: Focusing on the differential *533 treatment or denial of opportunity for which relief is sought, the reviewing court must determine whether the proffered justification is ""exceedingly persuasive."" The burden of justification is demanding and it rests entirely on the State. See Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at 724. The State must show ""at least that the [challenged] classification serves `important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed' are `substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.' "" Ibid. (quoting Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co. , 446 U.S. 142, 150 (1980)). The justification must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation. And it must not rely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females. See Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 643, 648 (1975); Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199, 223-224 (1977) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).
The heightened review standard our precedent establishes does not make sex a proscribed classification. Supposed ""inherent differences"" are no longer accepted as a ground for race or national origin classifications. See Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967). Physical differences between men and women, however, are enduring: ""[T]he two sexes are not fungible; a community made up exclusively of one [sex] is different from a community composed of both."" Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187, 193 (1946).
""Inherent differences"" between men and women, we have come to appreciate, remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial constraints on an individual's opportunity. Sex classifications may be used to compensate women ""for particular economic disabilities [they have] suffered,"" Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313, 320 (1977) (per curiam), to ""promot[e] equal employment opportunity,"" see California Fed. Sav. & Loan  Assn. v. Guerra, 479 U.S. 272, 289 (1987), to advance full development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people.[7]*534 But such classifications may not be used, as they once were, see Goesaert, 335 U. S., at 467, to create or perpetuate the legal, social, and economic inferiority of women.
Measuring the record in this case against the review standard just described, we conclude that Virginia has shown no ""exceedingly persuasive justification"" for excluding all women from the citizen-soldier training afforded by VMI. We therefore affirm the Fourth Circuit's initial judgment, which held that Virginia had violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Because the remedy proffered by Virginiathe Mary Baldwin VWIL programdoes not cure the constitutional violation, i. e. , it does not provide equal opportunity, we reverse the Fourth Circuit's final judgment in this case.

V
The Fourth Circuit initially held that Virginia had advanced no state policy by which it could justify, under equal protection principles, its determination ""to afford VMI's unique type of program to men and not to women."" 976 F.2d, at 892. Virginia challenges that ""liability"" ruling and asserts two justifications in defense of VMI's exclusion of *535 women. First, the Commonwealth contends, ""single-sex education provides important educational benefits,"" Brief for Cross-Petitioners 20, and the option of single-sex education contributes to ""diversity in educational approaches,"" id. , at 25. Second, the Commonwealth argues, ""the unique VMI method of character development and leadership training,"" the school's adversative approach, would have to be modified were VMI to admit women. Id. , at 33-36 (internal quotation marks omitted). We consider these two justifications in turn.

A
Single-sex education affords pedagogical benefits to at least some students, Virginia emphasizes, and that reality is uncontested in this litigation.[8] Similarly, it is not disputed that diversity among public educational institutions can serve the public good. But Virginia has not shown that VMI was established, or has been maintained, with a view to diversifying, by its categorical exclusion of women, educational opportunities within the Commonwealth. In cases of this genre, our precedent instructs that ""benign"" justifications proffered in defense of categorical exclusions will not be accepted automatically; a tenable justification must describe actual state purposes, not rationalizations for actions *536 in fact differently grounded. See Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S., at 648, and n. 16 (""mere recitation of a benign [or] compensatory purpose"" does not block ""inquiry into the actual purposes"" of government-maintained gender-based classifications); Goldfarb, 430 U. S., at 212-213 (rejecting government-proffered purposes after ""inquiry into the actual purposes"" (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Mississippi Univ. for Women is immediately in point. There the State asserted, in justification of its exclusion of men from a nursing school, that it was engaging in ""educational affirmative action"" by ""compensat[ing] for discrimination against women."" 458 U.S., at 727. Undertaking a ""searching analysis,"" id. , at 728, the Court found no close resemblance between ""the alleged objective"" and ""the actual purpose underlying the discriminatory classification,"" id. , at 730. Pursuing a similar inquiry here, we reach the same conclusion.
Neither recent nor distant history bears out Virginia's alleged pursuit of diversity through single-sex educational options. In 1839, when the Commonwealth established VMI, a range of educational opportunities for men and women was scarcely contemplated. Higher education at the time was considered dangerous for women;[9] reflecting *537 widely held views about women's proper place, the Nation's first universities and collegesfor example, Harvard in Massachusetts, William and Mary in Virginiaadmitted only men. See E. Farello, A History of the Education of Women in the United States 163 (1970). VMI was not at all novel in this respect: In admitting no women, VMI followed the lead of the Commonwealth's flagship school, the University of Virginia, founded in 1819.
""[N]o struggle for the admission of women to a state university,"" a historian has recounted, ""was longer drawn out, or developed more bitterness, than that at the University of Virginia."" 2 T. Woody, A History of Women's Education in the United States 254 (1929) (History of Women's Education). In 1879, the State Senate resolved to look into the possibility of higher education for women, recognizing that Virginia ""`has never, at any period of her history,' "" provided for the higher education of her daughters, though she ""`has liberally provided for the higher education of her sons.' "" Ibid. (quoting 10 Educ. J. Va. 212 (1879)). Despite this recognition, no new opportunities were instantly open to women.[10]
Virginia eventually provided for several women's seminaries and colleges. Farmville Female Seminary became a public institution in 1884. See supra, at 521, n. 2. Two women's schools, Mary Washington College and James Madison University, were founded in 1908; another, Radford University, was founded in 1910. 766 F. Supp., at 1418-1419. By the mid-1970's, all four schools had become coeducational. Ibid. 
Debate concerning women's admission as undergraduates at the main university continued well past the century's midpoint. Familiar arguments were rehearsed. If women *538 were admitted, it was feared, they ""would encroach on the rights of men; there would be new problems of government, perhaps scandals; the old honor system would have to be changed; standards would be lowered to those of other coeducational schools; and the glorious reputation of the university, as a school for men, would be trailed in the dust."" 2 History of Women's Education 255.
Ultimately, in 1970, ""the most prestigious institution of higher education in Virginia,"" the University of Virginia, introduced coeducation and, in 1972, began to admit women on an equal basis with men. See Kirstein v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Virginia, 309 F. Supp. 184, 186 (ED Va. 1970). A three-judge Federal District Court confirmed: ""Virginia may not now deny to women, on the basis of sex, educational opportunities at the Charlottesville campus that are not afforded in other institutions operated by the [S]tate."" Id. , at 187.
Virginia describes the current absence of public single-sex higher education for women as ""an historical anomaly."" Brief for Cross-Petitioners 30. But the historical record indicates action more deliberate than anomalous: First, protection of women against higher education; next, schools for women far from equal in resources and stature to schools for men; finally, conversion of the separate schools to coeducation. The state legislature, prior to the advent of this controversy, had repealed ""[a]ll Virginia statutes requiring individual institutions to admit only men or women."" 766 F. Supp., at 1419. And in 1990, an official commission, ""legislatively established to chart the future goals of higher education in Virginia,"" reaffirmed the policy ""`of affording broad access"" while maintaining ""autonomy and diversity.' "" 976 F.2d, at 898-899 (quoting Report of the Virginia Commission on the University of the 21st Century). Significantly, the commission reported:
""`Because colleges and universities provide opportunities for students to develop values and learn from role *539 models, it is extremely important that they deal with faculty, staff, and students without regard to sex, race, or ethnic origin.' "" Id. , at 899 (emphasis supplied by Court of Appeals deleted).
This statement, the Court of Appeals observed, ""is the only explicit one that we have found in the record in which the Commonwealth has expressed itself with respect to gender distinctions."" Ibid. 
Our 1982 decision in Mississippi Univ. for Women  prompted VMI to reexamine its male-only admission policy. See 766 F. Supp., at 1427-1428. Virginia relies on that reexamination as a legitimate basis for maintaining VMI's single-sex character. See Reply Brief for Cross-Petitioners 6. A Mission Study Committee, appointed by the VMI Board of Visitors, studied the problem from October 1983 until May 1986, and in that month counseled against ""change of VMI status as a single-sex college."" See 766 F. Supp., at 1429 (internal quotation marks omitted). Whatever internal purpose the Mission Study Committee servedand however well meaning the framers of the reportwe can hardly extract from that effort any commonwealth policy evenhandedly to advance diverse educational options. As the District Court observed, the Committee's analysis ""primarily focuse[d] on anticipated difficulties in attracting females to VMI,"" and the report, overall, supplied ""very little indication of how th[e] conclusion was reached."" Ibid. 
In sum, we find no persuasive evidence in this record that VMI's male-only admission policy ""is in furtherance of a state policy of `diversity.' "" See 976 F.2d, at 899. No such policy, the Fourth Circuit observed, can be discerned from the movement of all other public colleges and universities in Virginia away from single-sex education. See ibid. That court also questioned ""how one institution with autonomy, but with no authority over any other state institution, can give effect to a state policy of diversity among institutions."" Ibid. A purpose genuinely to advance an array of educational *540 options, as the Court of Appeals recognized, is not served by VMI's historic and constant plana plan to ""affor[d] a unique educational benefit only to males."" Ibid.  However ""liberally"" this plan serves the Commonwealth's sons, it makes no provision whatever for her daughters. That is not equal protection.

B
Virginia next argues that VMI's adversative method of training provides educational benefits that cannot be made available, unmodified, to women. Alterations to accommodate women would necessarily be ""radical,"" so ""drastic,"" Virginia asserts, as to transform, indeed ""destroy,"" VMI's program. See Brief for Cross-Petitioners 34-36. Neither sex would be favored by the transformation, Virginia maintains: Men would be deprived of the unique opportunity currently available to them; women would not gain that opportunity because their participation would ""eliminat[e] the very aspects of [the] program that distinguish [VMI] from . . . other institutions of higher education in Virginia."" Id., at 34.
The District Court forecast from expert witness testimony, and the Court of Appeals accepted, that coeducation would materially affect ""at least these three aspects of VMI's programphysical training, the absence of privacy, and the adversative approach."" 976 F.2d, at 896-897. And it is uncontested that women's admission would require accommodations, primarily in arranging housing assignments and physical training programs for female cadets. See Brief for Cross-Respondent 11, 29-30. It is also undisputed, however, that ""the VMI methodology could be used to educate women."" 852 F. Supp., at 481. The District Court even allowed that some women may prefer it to the methodology a women's college might pursue. See ibid. ""[S]ome women, at least, would want to attend [VMI] if they had the opportunity,"" the District Court recognized, 766 F. Supp., at 1414, and ""some women,"" the expert testimony established, ""are *541 capable of all of the individual activities required of VMI cadets,"" id., at 1412. The parties, furthermore, agree that ""some women can meet the physical standards [VMI] now impose[s] on men."" 976 F.2d, at 896. In sum, as the Court of Appeals stated, ""neither the goal of producing citizen soldiers,"" VMI's raison d'être, ""nor VMI's implementing methodology is inherently unsuitable to women."" Id., at 899.
In support of its initial judgment for Virginia, a judgment rejecting all equal protection objections presented by the United States, the District Court made ""findings"" on ""gender-based developmental differences."" 766 F. Supp., at 1434-1435. These ""findings"" restate the opinions of Virginia's expert witnesses, opinions about typically male or typically female ""tendencies."" Id., at 1434. For example, ""[m]ales tend to need an atmosphere of adversativeness,"" while ""[f]emales tend to thrive in a cooperative atmosphere."" Ibid. ""I'm not saying that some women don't do well under [the] adversative model,"" VMI's expert on educational institutions testified, ""undoubtedly there are some [women] who do""; but educational experiences must be designed ""around the rule,"" this expert maintained, and not ""around the exception."" Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).
The United States does not challenge any expert witness estimation on average capacities or preferences of men and women. Instead, the United States emphasizes that time and again since this Court's turning point decision in Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), we have cautioned reviewing courts to take a ""hard look"" at generalizations or ""tendencies"" of the kind pressed by Virginia, and relied upon by the District Court. See O'Connor, Portia's Progress, 66 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1546, 1551 (1991). State actors controlling gates to opportunity, we have instructed, may not exclude qualified individuals based on ""fixed notions concerning the roles and abilities of males and females."" Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at 725; see J. E. B., 511 U. S., at 139, n. 11 (equal protection principles, as applied to gender classifications, mean *542 state actors may not rely on ""overbroad"" generalizations to make ""judgments about people that are likely to . . . perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination"").
It may be assumed, for purposes of this decision, that most women would not choose VMI's adversative method. As Fourth Circuit Judge Motz observed, however, in her dissent from the Court of Appeals' denial of rehearing en banc, it is also probable that ""many men would not want to be educated in such an environment."" 52 F.3d, at 93. (On that point, even our dissenting colleague might agree.) Education, to be sure, is not a ""one size fits all"" business. The issue, however, is not whether ""womenor menshould be forced to attend VMI""; rather, the question is whether the Commonwealth can constitutionally deny to women who have the will and capacity, the training and attendant opportunities that VMI uniquely affords. Ibid. 
The notion that admission of women would downgrade VMI's stature, destroy the adversative system and, with it, even the school,[11] is a judgment hardly proved,[12] a prediction *543 hardly different from other ""self-fulfilling prophec[ies],"" see Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at 730, once routinely used to deny rights or opportunities. When women first sought admission to the bar and access to legal education, concerns of the same order were expressed. For example, in 1876, the Court of Common Pleas of Hennepin County, Minnesota, explained why women were thought ineligible for the practice of law. Women train and educate the young, the court said, which
""forbids that they shall bestow that time (early and late) and labor, so essential in attaining to the eminence to which the true lawyer should ever aspire. It cannot therefore be said that the opposition of courts to the admission of females to practice . . . is to any extent the outgrowth of . . . `old fogyism[.]' . . . [I]t arises rather from a comprehension of the magnitude of the responsibilities connected with the successful practice of law, and a desire to grade up the profession."" In re Application of Martha Angle Dorsett to Be Admitted to Practice as Attorney and Counselor at Law (Minn. C. P. Hennepin Cty., 1876), in The Syllabi, Oct. 21, 1876, pp. 5, 6 (emphasis added).
A like fear, according to a 1925 report, accounted for Columbia Law School's resistance to women's admission, although
""[t]he faculty . . . never maintained that women could not master legal learning . . . . No, its argument has been . . . more practical. If women were admitted to *544 the Columbia Law School, [the faculty] said, then the choicer, more manly and red-blooded graduates of our great universities would go to the Harvard Law School!"" The Nation, Feb. 18, 1925, p. 173.
Medical faculties similarly resisted men and women as partners in the study of medicine. See R. Morantz-Sanchez, Sympathy and Science: Women Physicians in American Medicine 51-54, 250 (1985); see also M. Walsh, ""Doctors Wanted: No Women Need Apply"" 121-122 (1977) (quoting E. Clarke, Medical Education of Women, 4 Boston Med. & Surg. J. 345, 346 (1869) (""`God forbid that I should ever see men and women aiding each other to display with the scalpel the secrets of the reproductive system . . . .' "")); cf. supra, at 536-537, n. 9. More recently, women seeking careers in policing encountered resistance based on fears that their presence would ""undermine male solidarity,"" see F. Heidensohn, Women in Control? 201 (1992); deprive male partners of adequate assistance, see id. , at 184-185; and lead to sexual misconduct, see C. Milton et al., Women in Policing 32-33 (1974). Field studies did not confirm these fears. See Heidensohn, supra, at 92-93; P. Bloch & D. Anderson, Policewomen on Patrol: Final Report (1974).
Women's successful entry into the federal military academies,[13] and their participation in the Nation's military forces,[14] indicate that Virginia's fears for the future of VMI *545 may not be solidly grounded.[15] The Commonwealth's justification for excluding all women from ""citizen-soldier"" training for which some are qualified, in any event, cannot rank as ""exceedingly persuasive,"" as we have explained and applied that standard.
Virginia and VMI trained their argument on ""means"" rather than ""end,"" and thus misperceived our precedent. Single-sex education at VMI serves an ""important governmental objective,"" they maintained, and exclusion of women is not only ""substantially related,"" it is essential to that objective. By this notably circular argument, the ""straightforward"" test Mississippi Univ. for Women described, see 458 U.S., at 724-725, was bent and bowed.
The Commonwealth's misunderstanding and, in turn, the District Court's, is apparent from VMI's mission: to produce ""citizen-soldiers,"" individuals
""`imbued with love of learning, confident in the functions and attitudes of leadership, possessing a high sense of public service, advocates of the American democracy and free enterprise system, and ready . . . to defend their country in time of national peril.' "" 766 F. Supp., at 1425 (quoting Mission Study Committee of the VMI Board of Visitors, Report, May 16, 1986).
Surely that goal is great enough to accommodate women, who today count as citizens in our American democracy equal in stature to men. Just as surely, the Commonwealth's *546 great goal is not substantially advanced by women's categorical exclusion, in total disregard of their individual merit, from the Commonwealth's premier ""citizen-soldier"" corps.[16] Virginia, in sum, ""has fallen far short of establishing the `exceedingly persuasive justification,' "" Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at 731, that must be the solid base for any gender-defined classification.

VI
In the second phase of the litigation, Virginia presented its remedial planmaintain VMI as a male-only college and create VWIL as a separate program for women. The plan met District Court approval. The Fourth Circuit, in turn, deferentially reviewed the Commonwealth's proposal and decided that the two single-sex programs directly served Virginia's reasserted purposes: single-gender education, and ""achieving the results of an adversative method in a military environment."" See 44 F.3d, at 1236, 1239. Inspecting the VMI and VWIL educational programs to determine whether they ""afford[ed] to both genders benefits comparable in substance, [if] not in form and detail,"" id., at 1240, the Court of Appeals concluded that Virginia had arranged for men and women opportunities ""sufficiently comparable"" to survive equal protection evaluation, id., at 1240-1241. The United States challenges this ""remedial"" ruling as pervasively misguided.


*547 A
A remedial decree, this Court has said, must closely fit the constitutional violation; it must be shaped to place persons unconstitutionally denied an opportunity or advantage in ""the position they would have occupied in the absence of [discrimination]."" See Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 280 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted). The constitutional violation in this suit is the categorical exclusion of women from an extraordinary educational opportunity afforded men. A proper remedy for an unconstitutional exclusion, we have explained, aims to ""eliminate [so far as possible] the discriminatory effects of the past"" and to ""bar like discrimination in the future."" Louisiana v. United States,  380 U.S. 145, 154 (1965).
Virginia chose not to eliminate, but to leave untouched, VMI's exclusionary policy. For women only, however, Virginia proposed a separate program, different in kind from VMI and unequal in tangible and intangible facilities.[17] Having violated the Constitution's equal protection requirement, Virginia was obliged to show that its remedial proposal ""directly address[ed] and relate[d] to"" the violation, see Milliken, 433 U. S., at 282, i. e., the equal protection denied to women ready, willing, and able to benefit from educational *548 opportunities of the kind VMI offers. Virginia described VWIL as a ""parallel program,"" and asserted that VWIL shares VMI's mission of producing ""citizen-soldiers"" and VMI's goals of providing ""education, military training, mental and physical discipline, character . . . and leadership development."" Brief for Respondents 24 (internal quotation marks omitted). If the VWIL program could not ""eliminate the discriminatory effects of the past,"" could it at least ""bar like discrimination in the future""? See Louisiana, 380 U. S., at 154. A comparison of the programs said to be ""parallel"" informs our answer. In exposing the character of, and differences in, the VMI and VWIL programs, we recapitulate facts earlier presented. See supra, at 520-523, 526-527.
VWIL affords women no opportunity to experience the rigorous military training for which VMI is famed. See 766 F. Supp., at 1413-1414 (""No other school in Virginia or in the United States, public or private, offers the same kind of rigorous military training as is available at VMI.""); id. , at 1421 (VMI ""is known to be the most challenging military school in the United States""). Instead, the VWIL program ""deemphasize[s]"" military education, 44 F.3d, at 1234, and uses a ""cooperative method"" of education ""which reinforces self-esteem,"" 852 F. Supp., at 476.
VWIL students participate in ROTC and a ""largely ceremonial"" Virginia Corps of Cadets, see 44 F.3d, at 1234, but Virginia deliberately did not make VWIL a military institute. The VWIL House is not a military-style residence and VWIL students need not live together throughout the 4-year program, eat meals together, or wear uniforms during the schoolday. See 852 F. Supp., at 477, 495. VWIL students thus do not experience the ""barracks"" life ""crucial to the VMI experience,"" the spartan living arrangements designed to foster an ""egalitarian ethic."" See 766 F. Supp., at 1423-1424. ""[T]he most important aspects of the VMI educational experience occur in the barracks,"" the District Court *549 found, id., at 1423, yet Virginia deemed that core experience nonessential, indeed inappropriate, for training its female citizen-soldiers.
VWIL students receive their ""leadership training"" in seminars, externships, and speaker series, see 852 F. Supp., at 477, episodes and encounters lacking the ""[p]hysical rigor, mental stress, . .. minute regulation of behavior, and indoctrination in desirable values"" made hallmarks of VMI's citizen-soldier training, see 766 F. Supp., at 1421.[18] Kept away from the pressures, hazards, and psychological bonding characteristic of VMI's adversative training, see id., at 1422, VWIL students will not know the ""feeling of tremendous accomplishment"" commonly experienced by VMI's successful cadets, id. , at 1426.
Virginia maintains that these methodological differences are ""justified pedagogically,"" based on ""important differences between men and women in learning and developmental needs,"" ""psychological and sociological differences"" Virginia describes as ""real"" and ""not stereotypes."" Brief for Respondents 28 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Task Force charged with developing the leadership program for women, drawn from the staff and faculty at Mary Baldwin College, ""determined that a military model and, especially VMI's adversative method, would be wholly inappropriate for educating and training most women. "" 852 F. Supp., at 476 (emphasis added). See also 44 F.3d, at 1233-1234 (noting Task Force conclusion that, while ""some women would be suited to and interested in [a VMI-style experience],"" VMI's adversative method ""would not be effective for women as a group "" (emphasis added)). The Commonwealth *550 embraced the Task Force view, as did expert witnesses who testified for Virginia. See 852 F. Supp., at 480-481.
As earlier stated, see supra, at 541-542, generalizations about ""the way women are,"" estimates of what is appropriate for most women, no longer justify denying opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description. Notably, Virginia never asserted that VMI's method of education suits most men. It is also revealing that Virginia accounted for its failure to make the VWIL experience ""the entirely militaristic experience of VMI"" on the ground that VWIL ""is planned for women who do not necessarily expect to pursue military careers."" 852 F. Supp., at 478. By that reasoning, VMI's ""entirely militaristic"" program would be inappropriate for men in general or as a group, for ""[o]nly about 15% of VMI cadets enter career military service."" See 766 F. Supp., at 1432.
In contrast to the generalizations about women on which Virginia rests, we note again these dispositive realities: VMI's ""implementing methodology"" is not ""inherently unsuitable to women,"" 976 F.2d, at 899; ""some women . . . do well under [the] adversative model,"" 766 F. Supp., at 1434 (internal quotation marks omitted); ""some women, at least, would want to attend [VMI] if they had the opportunity,"" id., at 1414; ""some women are capable of all of the individual activities required of VMI cadets,"" id., at 1412, and ""can meet the physical standards [VMI] now impose[s] on men,"" 976 F.2d, at 896. It is on behalf of these women that the United States has instituted this suit, and it is for them that a remedy must be crafted,[19] a remedy that will end their *551 exclusion from a state-supplied educational opportunity for which they are fit, a decree that will ""bar like discrimination in the future."" Louisiana, 380 U. S., at 154.

B
In myriad respects other than military training, VWIL does not qualify as VMI's equal. VWIL's student body, faculty, course offerings, and facilities hardly match VMI's. Nor can the VWIL graduate anticipate the benefits associated with VMI's 157-year history, the school's prestige, and its influential alumni network.
Mary Baldwin College, whose degree VWIL students will gain, enrolls first-year women with an average combined SAT score about 100 points lower than the average score for VMI freshmen. 852 F. Supp., at 501. The Mary Baldwin faculty holds ""significantly fewer Ph. D.'s,"" id. , at 502, and receives substantially lower salaries, see Tr. 158 (testimony of James Lott, Dean of Mary Baldwin College), than the faculty at VMI.
Mary Baldwin does not offer a VWIL student the range of curricular choices available to a VMI cadet. VMI awards baccalaureate degrees in liberal arts, biology, chemistry, civil engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering. See 852 F. Supp., at 503; Virginia Military Institute: More than an Education 11 (Govt. exh. 75, *552 lodged with Clerk of this Court). VWIL students attend a school that ""does not have a math and science focus,"" 852 F. Supp., at 503; they cannot take at Mary Baldwin any courses in engineering or the advanced math and physics courses VMI offers, see id., at 477.
For physical training, Mary Baldwin has ""two multipurpose fields"" and ""[o]ne gymnasium."" Id. , at 503. VMI has ""an NCAA competition level indoor track and field facility; a number of multi-purpose fields; baseball, soccer and lacrosse fields; an obstacle course; large boxing, wrestling and martial arts facilities; an 11-laps-to-the-mile indoor running course; an indoor pool; indoor and outdoor rifle ranges; and a football stadium that also contains a practice field and outdoor track."" Ibid. 
Although Virginia has represented that it will provide equal financial support for in-state VWIL students and VMI cadets, id. , at 483, and the VMI Foundation has agreed to endow VWIL with $5.4625 million, id. , at 499, the difference between the two schools' financial reserves is pronounced. Mary Baldwin's endowment, currently about $19 million, will gain an additional $35 million based on future commitments; VMI's current endowment, $131 millionthe largest public college per-student endowment in the Nationwill gain $220 million. Id. , at 503.
The VWIL student does not graduate with the advantage of a VMI degree. Her diploma does not unite her with the legions of VMI ""graduates [who] have distinguished themselves"" in military and civilian life. See 976 F.2d, at 892-893. ""[VMI] alumni are exceptionally close to the school,"" and that closeness accounts, in part, for VMI's success in attracting applicants. See 766 F. Supp., at 1421. A VWIL graduate cannot assume that the ""network of business owners, corporations, VMI graduates and non-graduate employers . . . interested in hiring VMI graduates,"" 852 F. Supp., at 499, will be equally responsive to her search for employment, *553 see 44 F.3d, at 1250 (Phillips, J., dissenting) (""the powerful political and economic ties of the VMI alumni network cannot be expected to open"" for graduates of the fledgling VWIL program).
Virginia, in sum, while maintaining VMI for men only, has failed to provide any ""comparable single-gender women's institution."" Id. , at 1241. Instead, the Commonwealth has created a VWIL program fairly appraised as a ""pale shadow"" of VMI in terms of the range of curricular choices and faculty stature, funding, prestige, alumni support and influence. See id., at 1250 (Phillips, J., dissenting).
Virginia's VWIL solution is reminiscent of the remedy Texas proposed 50 years ago, in response to a state trial court's 1946 ruling that, given the equal protection guarantee, African-Americans could not be denied a legal education at a state facility. See Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950). Reluctant to admit African-Americans to its flagship University of Texas Law School, the State set up a separate school for Heman Sweatt and other black law students. Id. , at 632. As originally opened, the new school had no independent faculty or library, and it lacked accreditation. Id. , at 633. Nevertheless, the state trial and appellate courts were satisfied that the new school offered Sweatt opportunities for the study of law ""substantially equivalent to those offered by the State to white students at the University of Texas."" Id. , at 632 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Before this Court considered the case, the new school had gained ""a faculty of five full-time professors; a student body of 23; a library of some 16,500 volumes serviced by a full-time staff; a practice court and legal aid association; and one alumnus who ha[d] become a member of the Texas Bar."" Id. , at 633. This Court contrasted resources at the new school with those at the school from which Sweatt had been excluded. The University of Texas Law School had a full-time faculty of 16, a student body of 850, a library containing over *554 65,000 volumes, scholarship funds, a law review, and moot court facilities. Id. , at 632-633.
More important than the tangible features, the Court emphasized, are ""those qualities which are incapable of objective measurement but which make for greatness"" in a school, including ""reputation of the faculty, experience of the administration, position and influence of the alumni, standing in the community, traditions and prestige."" Id. , at 634. Facing the marked differences reported in the Sweatt opinion, the Court unanimously ruled that Texas had not shown ""substantial equality in the [separate] educational opportunities"" the State offered. Id. , at 633. Accordingly, the Court held, the Equal Protection Clause required Texas to admit AfricanAmericans to the University of Texas Law School. Id. , at 636. In line with Sweatt, we rule here that Virginia has not shown substantial equality in the separate educational opportunities the Commonwealth supports at VWIL and VMI.

C
When Virginia tendered its VWIL plan, the Fourth Circuit did not inquire whether the proposed remedy, approved by the District Court, placed women denied the VMI advantage in ""the position they would have occupied in the absence of [discrimination]."" Milliken, 433 U. S., at 280 (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, the Court of Appeals considered whether the Commonwealth could provide, with fidelity to the equal protection principle, separate and unequal educational programs for men and women.
The Fourth Circuit acknowledged that ""the VWIL degree from Mary Baldwin College lacks the historical benefit and prestige of a degree from VMI."" 44 F.3d, at 1241. The Court of Appeals further observed that VMI is ""an ongoing and successful institution with a long history,"" and there remains no ""comparable single-gender women's institution."" Ibid. Nevertheless, the appeals court declared the substantially different and significantly unequal VWIL program satisfactory. *555 The court reached that result by revising the applicable standard of review. The Fourth Circuit displaced the standard developed in our precedent, see supra, at 532-534, and substituted a standard of its own invention.
We have earlier described the deferential review in which the Court of Appeals engaged, see supra, at 528-529, a brand of review inconsistent with the more exacting standard our precedent requires, see supra, at 532-534. Quoting in part from Mississippi Univ. for Women, the Court of Appeals candidly described its own analysis as one capable of checking a legislative purpose ranked as ""pernicious,"" but generally according ""deference to [the] legislative will."" 44 F.3d, at 1235, 1236. Recognizing that it had extracted from our decisions a test yielding ""little or no scrutiny of the effect of a classification directed at [single-gender education],"" the Court of Appeals devised another test, a ""substantive comparability"" inquiry, id., at 1237, and proceeded to find that new test satisfied, id. , at 1241.
The Fourth Circuit plainly erred in exposing Virginia's VWIL plan to a deferential analysis, for ""all gender-based classifications today"" warrant ""heightened scrutiny."" See J. E. B., 511 U. S., at 136. Valuable as VWIL may prove for students who seek the program offered, Virginia's remedy affords no cure at all for the opportunities and advantages withheld from women who want a VMI education and can make the grade. See supra, at 549-554.[20] In sum, Virginia's *556 remedy does not match the constitutional violation; the Commonwealth has shown no ""exceedingly persuasive justification"" for withholding from women qualified for the experience premier training of the kind VMI affords.

VII
A generation ago, ""the authorities controlling Virginia higher education,"" despite long established tradition, agreed ""to innovate and favorably entertain[ed] the [then] relatively new idea that there must be no discrimination by sex in offering educational opportunity."" Kirstein, 309 F. Supp., at 186. Commencing in 1970, Virginia opened to women ""educational opportunities at the Charlottesville campus that [were] not afforded in other [state-operated] institutions."" Id., at 187; see supra, at 538. A federal court approved the Commonwealth's innovation, emphasizing that the University of Virginia ""offer[ed] courses of instruction . . . not available elsewhere."" 309 F. Supp., at 187. The court further noted: ""[T]here exists at Charlottesville a `prestige' factor *557 [not paralleled in] other Virginia educational institutions."" Ibid. 
VMI, too, offers an educational opportunity no other Virginia institution provides, and the school's ""prestige""associated with its success in developing ""citizen-soldiers""is unequaled. Virginia has closed this facility to its daughters and, instead, has devised for them a ""parallel program,"" with a faculty less impressively credentialed and less well paid, more limited course offerings, fewer opportunities for military training and for scientific specialization. Cf. Sweatt,  339 U. S., at 633. VMI, beyond question, ""possesses to a far greater degree"" than the VWIL program ""those qualities which are incapable of objective measurement but which make for greatness in a . . . school,"" including ""position and influence of the alumni, standing in the community, traditions and prestige."" Id., at 634. Women seeking and fit for a VMI-quality education cannot be offered anything less, under the Commonwealth's obligation to afford them genuinely equal protection.
A prime part of the history of our Constitution, historian Richard Morris recounted, is the story of the extension of constitutional rights and protections to people once ignored or excluded.[21] VMI's story continued as our comprehension of ""We the People"" expanded. See supra, at 532, n. 6. *558 There is no reason to believe that the admission of women capable of all the activities required of VMI cadets would destroy the Institute rather than enhance its capacity to serve the ""more perfect Union.""

* * *
For the reasons stated, the initial judgment of the Court of Appeals, 976 F.2d 890 (CA4 1992), is affirmed, the final judgment of the Court of Appeals, 44 F.3d 1229 (CA4 1995), is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered. 
Justice Thomas took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.
Chief Justice Rehnquist, concurring in the judgment."
13313,Justice Rehnquist,concurring,False,United States v. Virginia,,1996,2.0,"The Court holds first that Virginia violates the Equal Protection Clause by maintaining the Virginia Military Institute's (VMI's) all-male admissions policy, and second that establishing the Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership (VWIL) program does not remedy that violation. While I agree with these conclusions, I disagree with the Court's analysis and so I write separately.

I
Two decades ago in Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 (1976), we announced that ""[t]o withstand constitutional challenge, . . . classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives."" We have adhered to that standard of scrutiny ever since. See Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199, 210-211 (1977); Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313, 316-317 (1977); Orr v. Orr, 440 U.S. 268, 279 (1979); Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U.S. 380, 388 (1979); Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 234-235, 235, n. 9 (1979); Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 273 (1979); *559 Califano v. Westcott, 443 U.S. 76, 85 (1979); Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U.S. 142, 150 (1980); Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U.S. 455, 459-460 (1981); Michael M. v. Superior Court, Sonoma Cty., 450 U.S. 464, 469 (1981); Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724 (1982); Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S. 728, 744 (1984); J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., 511 U.S. 127, 137, n. 6 (1994). While the majority adheres to this test today, ante, at 524, 533, it also says that the Commonwealth must demonstrate an ""`exceedingly persuasive justification' "" to support a gender-based classification. See ante, at 524, 529, 530, 531, 533, 534, 545, 546, 556. It is unfortunate that the Court thereby introduces an element of uncertainty respecting the appropriate test.
While terms like ""important governmental objective"" and ""substantially related"" are hardly models of precision, they have more content and specificity than does the phrase ""exceedingly persuasive justification."" That phrase is best confined, as it was first used, as an observation on the difficulty of meeting the applicable test, not as a formulation of the test itself. See, e. g., Feeney, supra, at 273 (""[T]hese precedents dictate that any state law overtly or covertly designed to prefer males over females in public employment require an exceedingly persuasive justification""). To avoid introducing potential confusion, I would have adhered more closely to our traditional, ""firmly established,"" Hogan, supra,  at 723; Heckler, supra, at 744, standard that a gender-based classification ""must bear a close and substantial relationship to important governmental objectives."" Feeney, supra, at 273.
Our cases dealing with gender discrimination also require that the proffered purpose for the challenged law be the actual purpose. See ante, at 533, 535-536. It is on this ground that the Court rejects the first of two justifications Virginia offers for VMI's single-sex admissions policy, namely, the goal of diversity among its public educational institutions. While I ultimately agree that the Commonwealth *560 has not carried the day with this justification, I disagree with the Court's method of analyzing the issue.
VMI was founded in 1839, and, as the Court notes, ante,  at 536-537, admission was limited to men because under the then-prevailing view men, not women, were destined for higher education. However misguided this point of view may be by present-day standards, it surely was not unconstitutional in 1839. The adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, with its Equal Protection Clause, was nearly 30 years in the future. The interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause to require heightened scrutiny for gender discrimination was yet another century away.
Long after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, and well into this century, legal distinctions between men and women were thought to raise no question under the Equal Protection Clause. The Court refers to our decision in Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U.S. 464 (1948). Likewise representing that now abandoned view was Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U.S. 57 (1961), where the Court upheld a Florida system of jury selection in which men were automatically placed on jury lists, but women were placed there only if they expressed an affirmative desire to serve. The Court noted that despite advances in women's opportunities, the ""woman is still regarded as the center of home and family life."" Id. , at 62.
Then, in 1971, we decided Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, which the Court correctly refers to as a seminal case. But its facts have nothing to do with admissions to any sort of educational institution. An Idaho statute governing the administration of estates and probate preferred men to women if the other statutory qualifications were equal. The statute's purpose, according to the Idaho Supreme Court, was to avoid hearings to determine who was better qualified as between a man and a woman both applying for letters of administration. This Court held that such a rule violated the Fourteenth Amendment because ""a mandatory preference to members of either *561 sex over members of the other, merely to accomplish the elimination of hearings,"" was an ""arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause."" Id. , at 76. The brief opinion in Reed made no mention of either Goesaert  or Hoyt. 
Even at the time of our decision in Reed v. Reed, therefore, Virginia and VMI were scarcely on notice that its holding would be extended across the constitutional board. They were entitled to believe that ""one swallow doesn't make a summer"" and await further developments. Those developments were 11 years in coming. In Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, supra, a case actually involving a singlesex admissions policy in higher education, the Court held that the exclusion of men from a nursing program violated the Equal Protection Clause. This holding did place Virginia on notice that VMI's men-only admissions policy was open to serious question.
The VMI Board of Visitors, in response, appointed a Mission Study Committee to examine ""the legality and wisdom of VMI's single-sex policy in light of"" Hogan. 766 F. Supp. 1407, 1427 (WD Va. 1991). But the committee ended up cryptically recommending against changing VMI's status as a single-sex college. After three years of study, the committee found ""`no information' "" that would warrant a change in VMI's status. Id. , at 1429. Even the District Court, ultimately sympathetic to VMI's position, found that ""[t]he Report provided very little indication of how [its] conclusion was reached"" and that ""[t]he one and one-half pages in the committee's final report devoted to analyzing the information it obtained primarily focuses on anticipated difficulties in attracting females to VMI."" Ibid. The reasons given in the report for not changing the policy were the changes that admission of women to VMI would require, and the likely effect of those changes on the institution. That VMI would have to change is simply not helpful in addressing the constitutionality of the status after Hogan. 
*562 Before this Court, Virginia has sought to justify VMI's single-sex admissions policy primarily on the basis that diversity in education is desirable, and that while most of the public institutions of higher learning in the Commonwealth are coeducational, there should also be room for single-sex institutions. I agree with the Court that there is scant evidence in the record that this was the real reason that Virginia decided to maintain VMI as men only.[*] But, unlike the majority, I would consider only evidence that postdates our decision in Hogan, and would draw no negative inferences from the Commonwealth's actions before that time. I think that after Hogan, the Commonwealth was entitled to reconsider its policy with respect to VMI, and not to have earlier justifications, or lack thereof, held against it.
Even if diversity in educational opportunity were the Commonwealth's actual objective, the Commonwealth's position would still be problematic. The difficulty with its position is that the diversity benefited only one sex; there was single-sex public education available for men at VMI, but no corresponding single-sex public education available for women. When Hogan placed Virginia on notice that *563 VMI's admissions policy possibly was unconstitutional, VMI could have dealt with the problem by admitting women; but its governing body felt strongly that the admission of women would have seriously harmed the institution's educational approach. Was there something else the Commonwealth could have done to avoid an equal protection violation? Since the Commonwealth did nothing, we do not have to definitively answer that question.
I do not think, however, that the Commonwealth's options were as limited as the majority may imply. The Court cites, without expressly approving it, a statement from the opinion of the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals, to the effect that the Commonwealth could have ""simultaneously opened single-gender undergraduate institutions having substantially comparable curricular and extra-curricular programs, funding, physical plant, administration and support services, and faculty and library resources."" Ante, at 529-530 (internal quotation marks omitted). If this statement is thought to exclude other possibilities, it is too stringent a requirement. VMI had been in operation for over a century and a half, and had an established, successful, and devoted group of alumni. No legislative wand could instantly call into existence a similar institution for women; and it would be a tremendous loss to scrap VMI's history and tradition. In the words of Grover Cleveland's second inaugural address, the Commonwealth faced a condition, not a theory. And it was a condition that had been brought about, not through defiance of decisions construing gender bias under the Equal Protection Clause, but, until the decision in Hogan, a condition that had not appeared to offend the Constitution. Had Virginia made a genuine effort to devote comparable public resources to a facility for women, and followed through on such a plan, it might well have avoided an equal protection violation. I do not believe the Commonwealth was faced with the stark choice of either admitting women to VMI, on the *564 one hand, or abandoning VMI and starting from scratch for both men and women, on the other.
But, as I have noted, neither the governing board of VMI nor the Commonwealth took any action after 1982. If diversity in the form of single-sex, as well as coeducational, institutions of higher learning were to be available to Virginians, that diversity had to be available to women as well as to men.
The dissent criticizes me for ""disregarding the four allwomen's private colleges in Virginia (generously assisted by public funds)."" Post, at 595. The private women's colleges are treated by the Commonwealth exactly as all other private schools are treated, which includes the provision of tuition-assistance grants to Virginia residents. Virginia gives no special support to the women's single-sex education. But obviously, the same is not true for men's education. Had the Commonwealth provided the kind of support for the private women's schools that it provides for VMI, this may have been a very different case. For in so doing, the Commonwealth would have demonstrated that its interest in providing a single-sex education for men was to some measure matched by an interest in providing the same opportunity for women.
Virginia offers a second justification for the single-sex admissions policy: maintenance of the adversative method. I agree with the Court that this justification does not serve an important governmental objective. A State does not have substantial interest in the adversative methodology unless it is pedagogically beneficial. While considerable evidence shows that a single-sex education is pedagogically beneficial for some students, see 766 F. Supp., at 1414, and hence a State may have a valid interest in promoting that methodology, there is no similar evidence in the record that an adversative method is pedagogically beneficial or is any more likely to produce character traits than other methodologies.


*565 II
The Court defines the constitutional violation in these cases as ""the categorical exclusion of women from an extraordinary educational opportunity afforded to men."" Ante, at 547. By defining the violation in this way, and by emphasizing that a remedy for a constitutional violation must place the victims ofdiscrimination in ""`the position they would have occupied in the absence of [discrimination],' "" ibid. , the Court necessarily implies that the only adequate remedy would be the admission of women to the allmale institution. As the foregoing discussion suggests, I would not define the violation in this way; it is not the ""exclusion of women"" that violates the Equal Protection Clause, but the maintenance of an all-men school without providing anymuch less a comparableinstitution for women.
Accordingly, the remedy should not necessarily require either the admission of women to VMI or the creation of a VMI clone for women. An adequate remedy in my opinion might be a demonstration by Virginia that its interest in educating men in a single-sex environment is matched by its interest in educating women in a single-sex institution. To demonstrate such, the Commonwealth does not need to create two institutions with the same number of faculty Ph. D.'s, similar SAT scores, or comparable athletic fields. See ante,  at 551-552. Nor would it necessarily require that the women's institution offer the same curriculum as the men's; one could be strong in computer science, the other could be strong in liberal arts. It would be a sufficient remedy, I think, if the two institutions offered the same quality of education and were of the same overall caliber.
If a State decides to create single-sex programs, the State would, I expect, consider the public's interest and demand in designing curricula. And rightfully so. But the State should avoid assuming demand based on stereotypes; it must not assume a priori, without evidence, that there would be *566 no interest in a women's school of civil engineering, or in a men's school of nursing.
In the end, the women's institution Virginia proposes, VWIL, fails as a remedy, because it is distinctly inferior to the existing men's institution and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. VWIL simply is not, in any sense, the institution that VMI is. In particular, VWIL is a program appended to a private college, not a self-standing institution; and VWIL is substantially underfunded as compared to VMI. I therefore ultimately agree with the Court that Virginia has not provided an adequate remedy."
13314,Justice Scalia,dissenting,False,United States v. Virginia,,1996,2.0,"Today the Court shuts down an institution that has served the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia with pride and distinction for over a century and a half. To achieve that desired result, it rejects (contrary to our established practice) the factual findings of two courts below, sweeps aside the precedents of this Court, and ignores the history of our people. As to facts: It explicitly rejects the finding that there exist ""gender-based developmental differences"" supporting Virginia's restriction of the ""adversative"" method to only a men's institution, and the finding that the all-male composition of the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) is essential to that institution's character. As to precedent: It drastically revises our established standards for reviewing sex-based classifications. And as to history: It counts for nothing the long tradition, enduring down to the present, of men's military colleges supported by both States and the Federal Government.
Much of the Court's opinion is devoted to deprecating the closed-mindedness of our forebears with regard to women's education, and even with regard to the treatment of women in areas that have nothing to do with education. Closedminded they wereas every age is, including our own, with regard to matters it cannot guess, because it simply does not *567 consider them debatable. The virtue of a democratic system with a First Amendment is that it readily enables the people, over time, to be persuaded that what they took for granted is not so, and to change their laws accordingly. That system is destroyed if the smug assurances of each age are removed from the democratic process and written into the Constitution. So to counterbalance the Court's criticism of our ancestors, let me say a word in their praise: They left us free to change. The same cannot be said of this most illiberal Court, which has embarked on a course of inscribing one after another of the current preferences of the society (and in some cases only the countermajoritarian preferences of the society's law-trained elite) into our Basic Law. Today it enshrines the notion that no substantial educational value is to be served by an all-men's military academyso that the decision by the people of Virginia to maintain such an institution denies equal protection to women who cannot attend that institution but can attend others. Since it is entirely clear that the Constitution of the United Statesthe old onetakes no sides in this educational debate, I dissent.

I
I shall devote most of my analysis to evaluating the Court's opinion on the basis of our current equal protection jurisprudence, which regards this Court as free to evaluate everything under the sun by applying one of three tests: ""rational basis"" scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, or strict scrutiny. These tests are no more scientific than their names suggest, and a further element of randomness is added by the fact that it is largely up to us which test will be applied in each case. Strict scrutiny, we have said, is reserved for state ""classifications based on race or national origin and classifications affecting fundamental rights,"" Clark v. Jeter,  486 U.S. 456, 461 (1988) (citation omitted). It is my position that the term ""fundamental rights"" should be limited to ""interest[s] traditionally protected by our society,"" Michael H.  *568 v. Gerald D., 491 U.S. 110, 122 (1989) (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.); but the Court has not accepted that view, so that strict scrutiny will be applied to the deprivation of whatever sort of right we consider ""fundamental."" We have no established criterion for ""intermediate scrutiny"" either, but essentially apply it when it seems like a good idea to load the dice. So far it has been applied to content-neutral restrictions that place an incidental burden on speech, to disabilities attendant to illegitimacy, and to discrimination on the basis of sex. See, e. g., Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 662 (1994); Mills v. Habluetzel, 456 U.S. 91, 98-99 (1982); Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 (1976).
I have no problem with a system of abstract tests such as rational basis, intermediate, and strict scrutiny (though I think we can do better than applying strict scrutiny and intermediate scrutiny whenever we feel like it). Such formulas are essential to evaluating whether the new restrictions that a changing society constantly imposes upon private conduct comport with that ""equal protection"" our society has always accorded in the past. But in my view the function of this Court is to preserve our society's values regarding (among other things) equal protection, not to revise  them; to prevent backsliding from the degree of restriction the Constitution imposed upon democratic government, not to prescribe, on our own authority, progressively higher degrees. For that reason it is my view that, whatever abstract tests we may choose to devise, they cannot supersedeand indeed ought to be crafted so as to reflect those constant and unbroken national traditions that embody the people's understanding of ambiguous constitutional texts. More specifically, it is my view that ""when a practice not expressly prohibited by the text of the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use that dates back to the beginning of the Republic, we have no proper basis for striking it down."" Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U.S. 62, 95 (1990) (Scalia, J., *569 dissenting). The same applies, mutatis mutandis, to a practice asserted to be in violation of the post-Civil War Fourteenth Amendment. See, e. g., Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U.S. 604 (1990) (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.) (Due Process Clause); J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., 511 U.S. 127, 156-163 (1994) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (Equal Protection Clause); Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 979-984, 1000-1001 (1992) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (various alleged ""penumbras"").
The all-male constitution of VMI comes squarely within such a governing tradition. Founded by the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1839 and continuously maintained by it since, VMI has always admitted only men. And in that regard it has not been unusual. For almost all of VMI's more than a century and a half of existence, its single-sex status reflected the uniform practice for government-supported military colleges. Another famous Southern institution, The Citadel, has existed as a state-funded school of South Carolina since 1842. And all the federal military collegesWest Point, the Naval Academy at Annapolis, and even the Air Force Academy, which was not established until 1954admitted only males for most of their history. Their admission of women in 1976 (upon which the Court today relies, see ante, at 544-545, nn. 13, 15) came not by court decree, but because the people, through their elected representatives, decreed a change. See, e. g., § 803(a), 89 Stat. 537, note following 10 U.S. C. § 4342. In other words, the tradition of having government-funded military schools for men is as well rooted in the traditions of this country as the tradition of sending only men into military combat. The people may decide to change the one tradition, like the other, through democratic processes; but the assertion that either tradition has been unconstitutional through the centuries is not law, but politics-smuggled-into-law.
And the same applies, more broadly, to single-sex education in general, which, as I shall discuss, is threatened by *570 today's decision with the cutoff of all state and federal support. Government-run non military educational institutions for the two sexes have until very recently also been part of our national tradition. ""[It is] [c]oeducation, historically, [that] is a novel educational theory. From grade school through high school, college, and graduate and professional training, much of the Nation's population during much of our history has been educated in sexually segregated classrooms."" Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 736 (1982) (Powell, J.,dissenting); see id., at 736-739. These traditions may of course be changed by the democratic decisions of the people, as they largely have been.
Today, however, change is forced upon Virginia, and reversion to single-sex education is prohibited nationwide, not by democratic processes but by order of this Court. Even while bemoaning the sorry, bygone days of ""fixed notions"" concerning women's education, see ante, at 536-537, and n. 10, 537-539, 542-544, the Court favors current notions so fixedly that it is willing to write them into the Constitution of the United States by application of custom-built ""tests."" This is not the interpretation of a Constitution, but the creation of one.

II
To reject the Court's disposition today, however, it is not necessary to accept my view that the Court's made-up tests cannot displace longstanding national traditions as the primary determinant of what the Constitution means. It is only necessary to apply honestly the test the Court has been applying to sex-based classifications for the past two decades. It is well settled, as Justice O'Connor stated some time ago for a unanimous Court, that we evaluate a statutory classification based on sex under a standard that lies ""[b]etween th[e] extremes of rational basis review and strict scrutiny."" Clark v. Jeter, 486 U. S., at 461. We have denominated this standard ""intermediate scrutiny"" and under it have inquired whether the statutory classification is ""substantially *571 related to an important governmental objective."" Ibid. See, e. g., Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S. 728, 744 (1984); Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U.S. 142, 150 (1980); Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S., at 197.
Before I proceed to apply this standard to VMI, I must comment upon the manner in which the Court avoids doing so. Notwithstanding our above-described precedents and their ""`firmly established principles,' "" Heckler, supra, at 744 (quoting Hogan, supra, at 723), the United States urged us to hold in this litigation ""that strict scrutiny is the correct constitutional standard for evaluating classifications that deny opportunities to individuals based on their sex."" Brief for United States in No. 94-2107, p. 16. (This was in flat contradiction of the Government's position below, which was, in its own words, to ""stat[e] unequivocally that the appropriate standard in this case is `intermediate scrutiny.' "" 2 Record, Doc. No. 88, p. 3 (emphasis added).) The Court, while making no reference to the Government's argument, effectively accepts it.
Although the Court in two places recites the test as stated in Hogan, see ante, at 524, 532-533, which asks whether the State has demonstrated ""that the classification serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives,"" 458 U.S., at 724 (internal quotation marks omitted), the Court never answers the question presented in anything resembling that form. When it engages in analysis, the Court instead prefers the phrase ""exceedingly persuasive justification"" from Hogan. The Court's nine invocations of that phrase, see ante, at 524, 529, 530, 531, 533, 534, 545, 546, 556, and even its fanciful description of that imponderable as ""the core instruction"" of the Court's decisions in J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., supra,  and Hogan, supra, see ante, at 531, would be unobjectionable if the Court acknowledged that whether a ""justification"" is ""exceedingly persuasive"" must be assessed by asking *572 ""[whether] the classification serves important governmental objectives and [whether] the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives."" Instead, however, the Court proceeds to interpret ""exceedingly persuasive justification"" in a fashion that contradicts the reasoning of Hogan and our other precedents.
That is essential to the Court's result, which can only be achieved by establishing that intermediate scrutiny is not survived if there are some women interested in attending VMI, capable of undertaking its activities, and able to meet its physical demands. Thus, the Court summarizes its holding as follows:
""In contrast to the generalizations about women on which Virginia rests, we note again these dispositive realities: VMI's implementing methodology is not inher-  ently unsuitable to women; some women do well under the adversative model; some women, at least, would want to attend VMI if they had the opportunity; some  women are capable of all of the individual activities required of VMI cadets and can meet the physical standards VMI now imposes on men."" Ante, at 550 (internal quotation marks, citations, and punctuation omitted; emphasis added).
Similarly, the Court states that ""[t]he Commonwealth's justification for excluding all women from `citizen-soldier' training for which some are qualified . . . cannot rank as `exceedingly persuasive' . . . ."" Ante, at 545.[1]
*573 Only the amorphous ""exceedingly persuasive justification"" phrase, and not the standard elaboration of intermediate scrutiny, can be made to yield this conclusion that VMI's single-sex composition is unconstitutional because there exist several women (or, one would have to conclude under the Court's reasoning, a single woman) willing and able to undertake VMI's program. Intermediate scrutiny has never required a least-restrictive-means analysis, but only a ""substantial relation"" between the classification and the state interests that it serves. Thus, in Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313 (1977) (per curiam), we upheld a congressional statute that provided higher Social Security benefits for women than for men. We reasoned that ""women . . . as such have been unfairly hindered from earning as much as men,"" but we did not require proof that each woman so benefited had suffered discrimination or that each disadvantaged man had not; it was sufficient that even under the former congressional scheme ""women on the average received lower retirement benefits than men."" Id., at 318, and n. 5 (emphasis added). The reasoning in our other intermediate-scrutiny cases has similarly required only a substantial relation between end and means, not a perfect fit. In Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981), we held that selective-service registration could constitutionally exclude women, because even ""assuming that a small number of women could be drafted for noncombat roles, Congress simply did not consider it worth the added burdens of including women in draft and registration plans."" Id., at 81. In Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547, 579, 582-583 (1990), overruled on other grounds, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U.S. 200, 227 (1995), we held that a classification need not be accurate ""in every case"" to survive intermediate scrutiny so long as, ""in the aggregate,"" it advances the underlying *574 objective. There issimply no support in our cases for the notion that a sex-based classification is invalid unless it relates to characteristics that hold true in every instance.
Not content to execute a de facto abandonment of the intermediate scrutiny that has been our standard for sex-based classifications for some two decades, the Court purports to reserve the question whether, even in principle, a higher standard (i. e., strict scrutiny) should apply. ""The Court has,"" it says, ""thus far reserved most stringent judicial scrutiny for classifications based on race or national origin . . . ,"" ante, at 532, n. 6 (emphasis added); and it describes our earlier cases as having done no more than decline to ""equat[e] gender classifications, for all purposes, to classifications based on race or national origin,"" ante, at 532 (emphasis added). The wonderful thing about these statements is that they are not actually falsejust as it would not be actually false to say that ""our cases have thus far reserved the `beyond a reasonable doubt' standard of proof for criminal cases,"" or that ""we have not equated tort actions, for all purposes, to criminal prosecutions."" But the statements are misleading, insofar as they suggest that we have not already categorically held strict scrutiny to be inapplicable to sexbased classifications. See, e. g., Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S. 728 (1984) (upholding state action after applying only  intermediate scrutiny); Michael M. v. Superior Court, Somoma Cty., 450 U.S. 464 (1981) (plurality and both concurring opinions) (same); Califano v. Webster, supra (per curiam) (same). And the statements are irresponsible, insofar as they are calculated to destabilize current law. Our task is to clarify the lawnot to muddy the waters, and not to exact overcompliance by intimidation. The States and the Federal Government are entitled to know before they act the standard to which they will be held, rather than be compelled to guess about the outcome of Supreme Court peek-a-boo.
The Court's intimations are particularly out of place because it is perfectly clear that, if the question of the applicable *575 standard of review for sex-based classifications were to be regarded as an appropriate subject for reconsideration, the stronger argument would be not for elevating the standard to strict scrutiny, but for reducing it to rational-basis review. The latter certainly has a firmer foundation in our past jurisprudence: Whereas no majority of the Court has ever applied strict scrutiny in a case involving sex-based classifications, we routinely applied rational-basis review until the 1970's, see, e. g., Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U.S. 57 (1961); Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U.S. 464 (1948). And of course normal, rational-basis review of sex-based classifications would be much more in accord with the genesis of heightened standards of judicial review, the famous footnote in United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144 (1938), which said (intimatingly) that we did not have to inquire in the case at hand
""whether prejudice against discrete and insular minorities may be a special condition, which tends seriously to curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities, and which may call for a correspondingly more searching judicial inquiry."" Id., at 152-153, n. 4.
It is hard to consider women a ""discrete and insular minorit[y]"" unable to employ the ""political processes ordinarily to be relied upon,"" when they constitute a majority of the electorate. And the suggestion that they are incapable of exerting that political power smacks of the same paternalism that the Court so roundly condemns. See, e. g., ante, at 536-537, 542-546 (and accompanying notes). Moreover, a long list of legislation proves the proposition false. See, e. g., Equal Pay Act of 1963, 29 U.S. C. § 206(d); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S. C. § 2000e-2; Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S. C. § 1681; Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-533, 102 Stat. 2689; *576 Violence Against Women Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-322, Title IV, 108 Stat. 1902.

III
With this explanation of how the Court has succeeded in making its analysis seem orthodoxand indeed, if intimations are to be believed, even overly generous to VMII now proceed to describe how the analysis should have been conducted. The question to be answered, I repeat, is whether the exclusion of women from VMI is ""substantially related to an important governmental objective.""

A
It is beyond question that Virginia has an important state interest in providing effective college education for itscitizens. That single-sex instruction is an approach substantially related to that interest should be evident enough from the long and continuing history in this country of men's and women's colleges. But beyond that, as the Court of Appeals here stated: ""That single-gender education at the college level is beneficial to both sexes is a fact established in this case. "" 44 F.3d 1229, 1238 (CA4 1995) (emphasis added).
The evidence establishing that fact was overwhelming indeed, ""virtually uncontradicted"" in the words of the court that received the evidence, 766 F. Supp. 1407, 1415 (WD Va. 1991). As an initial matter, Virginia demonstrated at trial that ""[a] substantial body of contemporary scholarship and research supports the proposition that, although males and females have significant areas of developmental overlap, they also have differing developmental needs that are deepseated."" Id., at 1434. While no one questioned that for many students a coeducational environment was nonetheless not inappropriate, that could not obscure the demonstrated benefits of single-sex colleges. For example, the District Court stated as follows:
""One empirical study in evidence, not questioned by any expert, demonstrates that single-sex colleges provide *577 better educational experiences than coeducational institutions. Students of both sexes become more academically involved, interact with faculty frequently, show larger increases in intellectual self-esteem and are more satisfied with practically all aspects of college experience (the sole exception is social life) compared with their counterparts in coeducational institutions. Attendance at an all-male college substantially increases the likelihood that a student will carry out career plans in law, business and college teaching, and also has a substantial positive effect on starting salaries in business. Women's colleges increase the chances that those who attend will obtain positions of leadership, complete the baccalaureate degree, and aspire to higher degrees."" Id., at 1412.
See also id., at 1434-1435 (factual findings). ""[I]n the light of this very substantial authority favoring single-sex education,"" the District Court concluded that ""the VMI Board's decision to maintain an all-male institution is fully justified even without taking into consideration the other unique features of VMI's teaching and training."" Id., at 1412. This finding alone, which even this Court cannot dispute, see ante,  at 535, should be sufficient to demonstrate the constitutionality of VMI's all-male composition.
But besides its single-sex constitution, VMI is different from other colleges in another way. It employs a ""distinctive educational method,"" sometimes referred to as the ""adversative, or doubting, model of education."" 766 F. Supp., at 1413, 1421. ""Physical rigor, mental stress, absolute equality of treatment, absence of privacy, minute regulation of behavior, and indoctrination in desirable values are the salient attributes of the VMI educational experience."" Id.,  at 1421. No one contends that this method is appropriate for all individuals; education is not a ""one size fits all"" business. Just as a State may wish to support junior colleges, vocational institutes, or a law school that emphasizes case *578 practice instead of classroom study, so too a State's decision to maintain within its system one school that provides the adversative method is ""substantially related"" to its goal of good education. Moreover, it was uncontested that ""if the state were to establish a women's VMI-type [i. e., adversative] program, the program would attract an insufficient number of participants to make the program work,"" 44 F.3d, at 1241; and it was found by the District Court that if Virginia were to include women in VMI, the school ""would eventually find it necessary to drop the adversative system altogether,"" 766 F. Supp., at 1413. Thus, Virginia's options were an adversative method that excludes women or no adversative method at all.
There can be no serious dispute that, as the District Court found, single-sex education and a distinctive educational method ""represent legitimate contributions to diversity in the Virginia higher education system."" Ibid. As a theoretical matter, Virginia's educational interest would have been best served (insofar as the two factors we have mentioned are concerned) by six different types of public collegesan all-men's, an all-women's, and a coeducational college run in the ""adversative method,"" and an all-men's, an all-women's, and a coeducational college run in the ""traditional method."" But as a practical matter, of course, Virginia's financial resources, like any State's, are not limitless, and the Commonwealth must select among the available options. Virginia thus has decided to fund, in addition to some 14 coeducational 4-year colleges, one college that is run as an all-male school on the adversative model: the Virginia Military Institute.
Virginia did not make this determination regarding the make-up of its public college system on the unrealistic assumption that no other colleges exist. Substantial evidence in the District Court demonstrated that the Commonwealth has long proceeded on the principle that ""`[h]igher education resources should be viewed as a wholepublic and private' *579 ""because such an approach enhances diversity and because ""`it is academic and economic waste to permit unwarranted duplication.' "" Id., at 1420-1421 (quoting 1974 Report of the General Assembly Commission on Higher Education to the General Assembly of Virginia). It is thus significant that, whereas there are ""four all-female private [colleges] in Virginia,"" there is only ""one private all-male college,"" which ""indicates that the private sector is providing for th[e] [former] form of education to a much greater extent that it provides for all-male education."" 766 F. Supp., at 1420-1421. In these circumstances, Virginia's election to fund one public all-male institution and one on the adversative modeland to concentrate its resources in a single entity that serves both these interests in diversityis substantially related to the Commonwealth's important educational interests.

B
The Court today has no adequate response to this clear demonstration of the conclusion produced by application of intermediate scrutiny. Rather, it relies on a series of contentions that are irrelevant or erroneous as a matter of law, foreclosed by the record in this litigation, or both.
1. I have already pointed out the Court's most fundamental error, which is its reasoning that VMI's all-male composition is unconstitutional because ""some women are capable of all of the individual activities required of VMI cadets,"" 766 F. Supp., at 1412, and would prefer military training on the adversative model. See supra, at 571-574. This unacknowledged adoption of what amounts to (at least) strict scrutiny is without antecedent in our sex-discrimination cases and by itself discredits the Court's decision.
2. The Court suggests that Virginia's claimed purpose in maintaining VMI as an all-male institutionits asserted interest in promoting diversity of educational optionsis not ""genuin[e],"" but is a pretext for discriminating against women. Ante, at 539; see ante, at 535-540. To support this *580 charge, the Court would have to impute that base motive to VMI's Mission Study Committee, which conducted a 3-year study from 1983 to 1986 and recommended to VMI's Board of Visitors that the school remain all male. The committee, a majority of whose members consisted of non-VMI graduates, ""read materials on education and on women in the military,"" ""made site visits to single-sex and newly coeducational institutions"" including West Point and the Naval Academy, and ""considered the reasons that other institutions had changed from single-sex to coeducational status""; its work was praised as ""thorough"" in the accreditation review of VMI conducted by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. See 766 F. Supp., at 1413, 1428; see also id.,  at 1427-1430 (detailed findings of fact concerning the Mission Study Committee). The Court states that ""[w]hatever internal purpose the Mission Study Committee served and however well meaning the framers of the reportwe can hardly extract from that effort any commonwealth policy evenhandedly to advance diverse educational options."" Ante, at 539. But whether it is part of the evidence to prove that diversity was the Commonwealth's objective (its short report said nothing on that particular subject) is quite separate from whether it is part of the evidence to prove that antifeminism was not. The relevance of the Mission Study Committee is that its very creation, its sober 3-year study, and the analysis it produced utterly refute the claim that VMI has elected to maintain its all-male student-body composition for some misogynistic reason.
The Court also supports its analysis of Virginia's ""actual state purposes"" in maintaining VMI's student body as all male by stating that there is no explicit statement in the record ""`in which the Commonwealth has expressed itself' "" concerning those purposes. Ante, at 535, 539 (quoting 976 F.2d 890, 899 (CA4 1992)); see also ante, at 525. That is wrong on numerous grounds. First and foremost, in its implication that such an explicit statement of ""actual purposes"" *581 is needed. The Court adopts, in effect, the argument of the United States that since the exclusion of women from VMI in 1839 was based on the ""assumptions"" of the time ""that men alone were fit for military and leadership roles,"" and since ""[b]efore this litigation was initiated, Virginia never sought to supply a valid, contemporary rationale for VMI's exclusionary policy,"" ""[t]hat failure itself renders the VMI policy invalid."" Brief for United States in No. 94-2107, at 10. This is an unheard-of doctrine. Each state decision to adopt or maintain a governmental policy need not be accompaniedin anticipation of litigation and on pain of being found to lack a relevant state interestby a lawyer's contemporaneous recitation of the State's purposes. The Constitution is not some giant Administrative Procedure Act, which imposes upon the States the obligation to set forth a ""statement of basis and purpose"" for their sovereign Acts, see 5 U.S. C. § 553(c). The situation would be different if what the Court assumes to have been the 1839 policy had  been enshrined and remained enshrined in legislationa VMI charter, perhaps, pronouncing that the institution's purpose is to keep women in their place. But since the 1839 policy was no more explicitly recorded than the Court contends the present one is, the mere fact that today's Commonwealth continues to fund VMI ""is enough to answer [the United States'] contention that the [classification] was the `accidental by-product of a traditional way of thinking about females.' "" Michael M., 450 U. S., at 471, n. 6 (plurality opinion) (quoting Califano v. Webster, 430 U. S., at 320) (internal quotation marks omitted).
It is, moreover, not true that Virginia's contemporary reasons for maintaining VMI are not explicitly recorded. It is hard to imagine a more authoritative source on this subject than the 1990 Report of the Virginia Commission on the University of the 21st Century (1990 Report). As the parties stipulated, that report ""notes that the hallmarks of Virginia's educational policy are `diversity and autonomy.' "" Stipulations *582 of Fact 37, reprinted in Lodged Materials from the Record 64 (Lodged Materials). It said: ""The formal system of higher education in Virginia includes a great array of institutions: state-supported and independent, two-year and senior, research and highly specialized, traditionally black and single-sex. "" 1990 Report, quoted in relevant part at Lodged Materials 64-65 (emphasis added).[2] The Court's only response to this is repeated reliance on the Court of Appeals' assertion that ""`the only explicit [statement] that we have found in the record in which the Commonwealth has expressed itself with respect to gender distinctions' "" (namely, the statement in the 1990 Report that the Commonwealth's institutions must ""deal with faculty, staff, and students without regard to sex"") had nothing to do with the purpose of diversity. Ante, at 525, 539 (quoting 976 F.2d, at 899). This proves, I suppose, that the Court of Appeals did not find a statement dealing with sex and diversity in the record; but the pertinent question (accepting the need for such a statement) is whether it was there. And the plain fact, which the Court does not deny, is that it was. 
*583 The Court contends that ""[a] purpose genuinely to advance an array of educational options . . . is not served"" by VMI. Ante, at 539-540. It relies on the fact that all of Virginia's other public colleges have become coeducational. Ibid.; see also ante, at 521, n. 2. The apparent theory of this argument is that unless Virginia pursues a great deal of diversity, its pursuit of some diversity must be a sham. This fails to take account of the fact that Virginia's resources cannot support all possible permutations of schools, see supra, at 578, and of the fact that Virginia coordinates its public educational offerings with the offerings of in-state private educational institutions that the Commonwealth provides money for its residents to attend and otherwise assistswhich include four women's colleges.[3]
Finally, the Court unreasonably suggests that there is some pretext in Virginia's reliance upon decentralized decisionmaking *584 to achieve diversityits granting of substantial autonomy to each institution with regard to student-body composition and other matters, see 766 F. Supp., at 1419. The Court adopts the suggestion of the Court of Appeals that it is not possible for ""one institution with autonomy, but with no authority over any other state institution, [to] give effect to a state policy of diversity among institutions."" Ante, at 539 (internal quotation marks omitted). If it were impossible for individual human beings (or groups of human beings) to act autonomously in effective pursuit of a common goal, the game of soccer would not exist. And where the goal is diversity in a free market for services, that tends to be achieved even by autonomous actors who act out of entirely selfish interests and make no effort to cooperate. Each Virginia institution, that is to say, has a natural incentive to make itself distinctive in order to attract a particular segment of student applicants. And of course none of the institutions is entirely autonomous; if and when the legislature decides that a particular school is not well serving the interest of diversityif it decides, for example, that a men's school is not much neededfunding will cease.[4]
*585 3. In addition to disparaging Virginia's claim that VMI's single-sex status serves a state interest in diversity, the Court finds fault with Virginia's failure to offer education based on the adversative training method to women. It dismisses the District Court's ""`findings' on `gender-based developmental differences' "" on the ground that ""[t]hese `findings' restate the opinions of Virginia's expert witnesses, opinions about typically male or typically female `tendencies.' "" Ante, at 541 (quoting 766 F. Supp., at 1434-1435). How remarkable to criticize the District Court on the ground that its findings rest on the evidence (i. e., the testimony of Virginia's witnesses)! That is what findings are supposed to do. It is indefensible to tell the Commonwealth that ""[t]he burden of justification is demanding and it rests entirely on [you],"" ante, at 533, and then to ignore the District Court's findings because they rest on the evidence put forward by the Commonwealthparticularly when, as the District Court said, ""[t]he evidence in the case . . . is virtually uncontradicted, "" 766 F. Supp., at 1415 (emphasis added).
Ultimately, in fact, the Court does not deny the evidence supporting these findings. See ante, at 541-546. It instead makes evident that the parties to this litigation could have saved themselves a great deal of time, trouble, and expense by omitting a trial. The Court simply dispenses with the evidence submitted at trialit never says that a single finding of the District Court is clearly erroneousin favor of the Justices' own view of the world, which the Court proceeds to support with (1) references to observations of someone *586 who is not a witness, nor even an educational expert, nor even a judge who reviewed the record or participated in the judgment below, but rather a judge who merely dissented from the Court of Appeals' decision not to rehear this litigation en banc, see ante, at 542, (2) citations of nonevidentiary materials such as amicus curiae briefs filed in this Court, see ante, at 544-545, nn. 13, 14, and (3) various historical anecdotes designed to demonstrate that Virginia's support for VMI as currently constituted reminds the Justices of the ""bad old days,"" see ante, at 542-544.
It is not too much to say that this approach to the litigation has rendered the trial a sham. But treating the evidence as irrelevant is absolutely necessary for the Court to reach its conclusion. Not a single witness contested, for example, Virginia's ""substantial body of `exceedingly persuasive' evidence . . . that some students, both male and female, benefit from attending a single-sex college"" and ""[that] [f]or those students, the opportunity to attend a single-sex college is a valuable one, likely to lead to better academic and professional achievement."" 766 F. Supp., at 1411-1412. Even the United States' expert witness ""called himself a `believer in single-sex education,' "" although it was his ""personal, philosophical preference,"" not one ""born of educational-benefit considerations,"" ""that single-sex education should be provided only by the private sector."" Id., at 1412.
4. The Court contends that Virginia, and the District Court, erred, and ""misperceived our precedent,"" by ""train[ing] their argument on `means' rather than `end,' "" ante,  at 545. The Court focuses on ""VMI's mission,"" which is to produce individuals ""imbued with love of learning, confident in the functions and attitudes of leadership, possessing a high sense of public service, advocates of the American democracy and free enterprise system, and ready . . . to defend their country in time of national peril."" 766 F. Supp., at 1425 (quoting Mission Study Committee of the VMI Board of *587 Visitors, Report, May 16, 1986). ""Surely,"" the Court says, ""that goal is great enough to accommodate women."" Ante,  at 545.
This is lawmaking by indirection. What the Court describes as ""VMI's mission"" is no less the mission of all Virginia colleges. Which of them would the Old Dominion continue to fund if they did not aim to create individuals ""imbued with love of learning, etc.,"" right down to being ready ""to defend their country in time of national peril""? It can be summed up as ""learning, leadership, and patriotism."" To be sure, those general educational values are described in a particularly martial fashion in VMI's mission statement, in accordance with the military, adversative, and all-male character of the institution. But imparting those values in that fashion i. e., in a military, adversative, all-male environmentis the distinctive mission of VMI. And as I have discussed (and both courts below found), that mission is not  ""great enough to accommodate women.""
The Court's analysis at least has the benefit of producing foreseeable results. Applied generally, it means that whenever a State's ultimate objective is ""great enough to accommodate women"" (as it always will be), then the State will be held to have violated the Equal Protection Clause if it restricts to men even one means by which it pursues that objectiveno matter how few women are interested in pursuing the objective by that means, no matter how much the single-sex program will have to be changed if both sexes are admitted, and no matter how beneficial that program has theretofore been to its participants.
5. The Court argues that VMI would not have to change very much if it were to admit women. See, e. g., ante, at 540-542. The principal response to that argument is that it is irrelevant: If VMI's single-sex status is substantially related to the government's important educational objectives, as I have demonstrated above and as the Court refuses to discuss, *588 that concludes the inquiry. There should be no debate in the federal judiciary over ""how much"" VMI would be required to change if it admitted women and whether that would constitute ""too much"" change.
But if such a debate were relevant, the Court would certainly be on the losing side. The District Court found as follows: ""[T]he evidence establishes that key elements of the adversative VMI educational system, with its focus on barracks life, would be fundamentally altered, and the distinctive ends of the system would be thwarted, if VMI were forced to admit females and to make changes necessary to accommodate their needs and interests."" 766 F. Supp., at 1411. Changes that the District Court's detailed analysis found would be required include new allowances for personal privacy in the barracks, such as locked doors and coverings on windows, which would detract from VMI's approach of regulating minute details of student behavior, ""contradict the principle that everyone is constantly subject to scrutiny by everyone else,"" and impair VMI's ""total egalitarian approach"" under which every student must be ""treated alike""; changes in the physical training program, which would reduce ""[t]he intensity and aggressiveness of the current program""; and various modifications in other respects of the adversative training program that permeates student life. See id., at 1412-1413, 1435-1443. As the Court of Appeals summarized it, ""the record supports the district court's findings that at least these three aspects of VMI's program physical training, the absence of privacy, and the adversative approachwould be materially affected by coeducation, leading to a substantial change in the egalitarian ethos that is a critical aspect of VMI's training."" 976 F.2d, at 896-897.
In the face of these findings by two courts below, amply supported by the evidence, and resulting in the conclusion that VMI would be fundamentally altered if it admitted women, this Court simply pronounces that ""[t]he notion that *589 admission of women would downgrade VMI's stature, destroy the adversative system and, with it, even the school, is a judgment hardly proved."" Ante, at 542 (footnote omitted). The point about ""downgrad[ing] VMI's stature"" is a straw man; no one has made any such claim. The point about ""destroy[ing] the adversative system"" is simply false; the District Court not only stated that ""[e]vidence supports this theory,"" but specifically concluded that while ""[w]ithout a doubt"" VMI could assimilate women, ""it is equally without a doubt that VMI's present methods of training and education would have to be changed"" by a ""move away from its adversative new cadet system."" 766 F. Supp., at 1413, and n. 8, 1440. And the point about ""destroy[ing] the school,"" depending upon what that ambiguous phrase is intended to mean, is either false or else sets a standard much higher than VMI had to meet. It sufficed to establish, as the District Court stated, that VMI would be ""significantly different"" upon the admission of women, 766 F. Supp., at 1412, and ""would eventually find it necessary to drop the adversative system altogether,"" id., at 1413.[5]
*590 6. Finally, the absence of a precise ""all-women's analogue"" to VMI is irrelevant. In Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718 (1982), we attached no constitutional significance to the absence of an all-male nursing school. As Virginia notes, if a program restricted to one sex is necessarily unconstitutional unless there is a parallel program restricted to the other sex, ""the opinion in Hogan could have ended with its first footnote, which observed that `Mississippi maintains no other single-sex public university or college.' "" Brief for Cross-Petitioners in No. 94-2107, p. 38 (quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, supra, at 720, n. 1).
Although there is no precise female-only analogue to VMI, Virginia has created during this litigation the Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership (VWIL), a state-funded all-women's program run by Mary Baldwin College. I have thus far said nothing about VWIL because it is, under our established test, irrelevant, so long as VMI `s all-male character is ""substantially related"" to an important state goal. But VWIL now exists, and the Court's treatment of it shows how far reaching today's decision is.
VWIL was carefully designed by professional educators who have long experience in educating young women. The program rejects the proposition that there is a ""difference in the respective spheres and destinies of man and woman,"" Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130, 141 (1873), and is designed to ""provide an all-female program that will achieve substantially similar outcomes [to VMI's] in an all-female environment,"" 852 F. Supp. 471, 481 (WD Va. 1994). After holding a trial where voluminous evidence was submitted and making detailed findings of fact, the District Court concluded that ""there is a legitimate pedagogical basis for the different means employed [by VMI and VWIL] to achieve the substantially *591 similar ends."" Ibid. The Court of Appeals undertook a detailed review of the record and affirmed. 44 F.3d 1229 (CA4 1995).[6] But it is Mary Baldwin College, which runs VWIL, that has made the point most succinctly:
""It would have been possible to develop the VWIL program to more closely resemble VMI, with adversative techniques associated with the rat line and barracks-like living quarters. Simply replicating an existing program would have required far less thought, research, and educational expertise. But such a facile approach would have produced a paper program with no real prospect of successful implementation."" Brief for Mary Baldwin College as Amicus Curiae 5.
It is worth noting that none of the United States' own experts in the remedial phase of this litigation was willing to testify that VMI's adversative method was an appropriate methodology for educating women. This Court, however, does not care. Even though VWIL was carefully designed by professional educators who have tremendous experience in the area, and survived the test of adversarial litigation, the Court simply declares, with no basis in the evidence, that *592 these professionals acted on ""`overbroad' generalizations,"" ante, at 542, 550.

C
A few words are appropriate in response to the concurrence, which finds VMI unconstitutional on a basis that is more moderate than the Court's but only at the expense of being even more implausible. The concurrence offers three reasons: First, that there is ""scant evidence in the record,"" ante, at 562, that diversity of educational offering was the real reason for Virginia's maintaining VMI. ""Scant"" has the advantage of being an imprecise term. I have cited the clearest statements of diversity as a goal for higher education in the 1990 Report, the 1989 Virginia Plan for Higher Education, the Budget Initiatives prepared in 1989 by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, the 1974 Report of the General Assembly Commission on Higher Education to the General Assembly of Virginia, and the 1969 Report of the Virginia Commission on Constitutional Revision. See supra, at 579, 581-582, and n. 2, 583, n. 3. There is no  evidence to the contrary, once one rejects (as the concurrence rightly does) the relevance of VMI's founding in days when attitudes toward the education of women were different. Is this conceivably not enough to foreclose rejecting as clearly erroneous the District Court's determination regarding ""the Commonwealth's objective of educational diversity""? 766 F. Supp., at 1413. Especially since it is absurd on its face even to demand ""evidence"" to prove that the Commonwealth's reason for maintaining a men's military academy is that a men's military academy provides a distinctive type of educational experience (i. e., fosters diversity). What other purpose would the Commonwealth have? One may argue, as the Court does, that this type of diversity is designed only to indulge hostility toward womenbut that is a separate point, explicitly rejected by the concurrence, and amply refuted by the evidence I have mentioned in discussing *593 the Court's opinion.[7] What is now under discussionthe concurrence's making central to the disposition of this litigation the supposedly ""scant"" evidence that Virginia maintained VMI in order to offer a diverse educational experienceis rather like making crucial to the lawfulness of the United States Army record ""evidence"" that its purpose is to do battle. A legal culture that has forgotten the concept of res ipsa loquitur deserves the fate that it today decrees for VMI.
Second, the concurrence dismisses out of hand what it calls Virginia's ""second justification for the single-sex admissions policy: maintenance of the adversative method."" Ante, at 564. The concurrence reasons that ""this justification does not serve an important governmental objective"" because, whatever the record may show about the pedagogical benefits of single-sex education, ""there is no similar evidence in the record that an adversative method is pedagogically beneficial or is any more likely to produce character traits than other methodologies."" Ibid. That is simply wrong. See, e. g., 766 F. Supp., at 1426 (factual findings concerning character traits produced by VMI's adversative methodology); id. , at 1434 (factual findings concerning benefits for many college-age men of an adversative approach in general). In reality, the pedagogical benefits of VMI's adversative approach were not only proved, but were a given in this litigation. The reason the woman applicant who prompted this suit wanted to enter VMI was assuredly not that she wanted to go to an all-male school; it would cease being all-male as *594 soon as she entered. She wanted the distinctive adversative education that VMI provided, and the battle was joined (in the main) over whether VMI had a basis for excluding women from that approach. The Court's opinion recognizes this, and devotes much of its opinion to demonstrating that ""`some women . . . do well under [the] adversative model' "" and that ""[i]t is on behalf of these women that the United States has instituted this suit."" Ante, at 550 (quoting 766 F. Supp., at 1434). Of course, in the last analysis it does not matter whether there are any benefits to the adversative method. The concurrence does not contest that there are benefits to single-sex education, and that alone suffices to make Virginia's case, since admission of a woman will even more surely put an end to VMI's single-sex education than it will to VMI's adversative methodology.
A third reason the concurrence offers in support of the judgment is that the Commonwealth and VMI were not quick enough to react to the ""further developments"" in this Court's evolving jurisprudence. Ante, at 561. Specifically, the concurrence believes it should have been clear after Hogan that ""[t]he difficulty with [Virginia's] position is that the diversity benefited only one sex; there was single-sex public education available for men at VMI, but no corresponding single-sex public education available for women."" Ante, at 562. If only, the concurrence asserts, Virginia had ""made a genuine effort to devote comparable public resources to a facility for women, and followed through on such a plan, it might well have avoided an equal protection violation."" Ante, at 563. That is to say, the concurrence believes that after our decision in Hogan (which held a program of the Mississippi University for Women to be unconstitutionalwithout any reliance on the fact that there was no corresponding Mississippi all-men's program), the Commonwealth should have known that what this Court expected of it was . . . yes!, the creation of a state all-women's program. Any lawyer who gave that advice to the Commonwealth *595 ought to have been either disbarred or committed. (The proof of that pudding is today's 6-Justice majority opinion.) And any Virginia politician who proposed such a step when there were already four 4-year women's colleges in Virginia (assisted by state support that may well exceed, in the aggregate, what VMI costs, see n. 3, supra ) ought to have been recalled.
In any event, ""diversity in the form of single-sex, as well as coeducational, institutions of higher learning"" is ""available to women as well as to men"" in Virginia. Ante, at 564. The concurrence is able to assert the contrary only by disregarding the four all-women's private colleges in Virginia (generously assisted by public funds) and the Commonwealth's longstanding policy of coordinating public with private educational offerings, see supra, at 579, 581-582, and n. 2, 583-584, and n. 3. According to the concurrence, the
2, Virginia's reason assistance to its four all-women's private colleges does not count is that ""[t]he private women's colleges are treated by the State exactly as all other private schools are treated."" Ante, at 564. But if Virginia cannot get credit for assisting women's education if it only treats women's private schools as it does all other private schools, then why should it get blame for assisting men's education if it only treats VMI as it does all other public schools? This is a great puzzlement.

IV
As is frequently true, the Court's decision today will have consequences that extend far beyond the parties to the litigation. What I take to be the Court's unease with these consequences, and its resulting unwillingness to acknowledge them, cannot alter the reality.

A
Under the constitutional principles announced and applied today, single-sex public education is unconstitutional. By going through the motions of applying a balancing testasking *596 whether the State has adduced an ""exceedingly persuasive justification"" for its sex-based classificationthe Court creates the illusion that government officials in some future case will have a clear shot at justifying some sort of singlesex public education. Indeed, the Court seeks to create even a greater illusion than that: It purports to have said nothing of relevance to other public schools at all. ""We address specifically and only an educational opportunity recognized . . . as `unique.' "" Ante, at 534, n. 7.
The Supreme Court of the United States does not sit to announce ""unique"" dispositions. Its principal function is to establish precedent that is, to set forth principles of law that every court in America must follow. As we said only this Term, we expect both ourselves and lower courts to adhere to the ""rationale upon which the Court based the results of its earlier decisions."" Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 66-67 (1996) (emphasis added). That is the principal reason we publish our opinions.
And the rationale of today's decision is sweeping: for sexbased classifications, a redefinition of intermediate scrutiny that makes it indistinguishable from strict scrutiny. See supra, at 571-574. Indeed, the Court indicates that if any program restricted to one sex is ""uniqu[e],"" it must be opened to members of the opposite sex ""who have the will and capacity"" to participate in it. Ante, at 542. I suggest that the single-sex program that will not be capable of being characterized as ""unique"" is not only unique but nonexistent.[8]
In any event, regardless of whether the Court's rationale leaves some small amount of room for lawyers to argue, it ensures that single-sex public education is functionally dead. *597 The costs of litigating the constitutionality of a single-sex education program, and the risks of ultimately losing that litigation, are simply too high to be embraced by public officials. Any person with standing to challenge any sex-based classification can haul the State into federal court and compel it to establish by evidence (presumably in the form of expert testimony) that there is an ""exceedingly persuasive justification"" for the classification. Should the courts happen to interpret that vacuous phrase as establishing a standard that is not utterly impossible of achievement, there is considerable risk that whether the standard has been met will not be determined on the basis of the record evidenceindeed, that will necessarily be the approach of any court that seeks to walk the path the Court has trod today. No state official in his right mind will buy such a high-cost, high-risk lawsuit by commencing a single-sex program. The enemies of singlesex education have won; by persuading only seven Justices (five would have been enough) that their view of the world is enshrined in the Constitution, they have effectively imposed that view on all 50 States.
This is especially regrettable because, as the District Court here determined, educational experts in recent years have increasingly come to ""suppor[t] [the] view that substantial educational benefits flow from a single-gender environment, be it male or female, that cannot be replicated in a coeducational setting. "" 766 F. Supp., at 1415 (emphasis added). ""The evidence in th[is] case,"" for example, ""is virtually uncontradicted"" to that effect. Ibid. Until quite recently, some public officials have attempted to institute new single-sex programs, at least as experiments. In 1991, for example, the Detroit Board of Education announced a program to establish three boys-only schools for inner-city youth; it was met with a lawsuit, a preliminary injunction was swiftly entered by a District Court that purported to rely on Hogan, see Garrett v. Board of Ed. of School Dist. of Detroit, 775 F. Supp. 1004, 1006 (ED Mich. 1991), and the *598 Detroit Board of Education voted to abandon the litigation and thus abandon the plan, see Detroit Plan to Aid Blacks with All-Boy Schools Abandoned, Los Angeles Times, Nov. 8, 1991, p. A4, col. 1. Today's opinion assures that no such experiment will be tried again.

B
There are few extant single-sex public educational programs. The potential of today's decision for widespread disruption of existing institutions lies in its application to private single-sex education. Government support is immensely important to private educational institutions. Mary Baldwin Collegewhich designed and runs VWIL notes that private institutions of higher education in the 1990-1991 school year derived approximately 19 percent of their budgets from federal, state, and local government funds, not including financial aid to students. See Brief for Mary Baldwin College as Amicus Curiae 22, n. 13 (citing U. S. Dept. of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Digest of Education Statistics, p. 38 and Note (1993)). Charitable status under the tax laws is also highly significant for private educational institutions, and it is certainly not beyond the Court that rendered today's decision to hold that a donation to a single-sex college should be deemed contrary to public policy and therefore not deductible if the college discriminates on the basis of sex. See Note, The Independent Sector and the Tax Laws: Defining Charity in an Ideal Democracy, 64 S. Cal. L. Rev. 461, 476 (1991). See also Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. 574 (1983).
The Court adverts to private single-sex education only briefly, and only to make the assertion (mentioned above) that ""[w]e address specifically and only an educational opportunity recognized by the District Court and the Court of Appeals as `unique.' "" Ante, at 534, n. 7. As I have already remarked, see supra, at 596, that assurance assures nothing, unless it is to be taken as a promise that in the future *599 the Court will disclaim the reasoning it has used today to destroy VMI. The Government, in its briefs to this Court, at least purports to address the consequences of its attack on VMI for public support of private single-sex education. It contends that private colleges that are the direct or indirect beneficiaries of government funding are not thereby necessarily converted into state actors to which the Equal Protection Clause is then applicable. See Brief for United States in No. 94-2107, at 35-37 (discussing Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830 (1982), and Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991 (1982)). That is true. It is also virtually meaningless.
The issue will be not whether government assistance turns private colleges into state actors, but whether the government itself would be violating the Constitution by providing state support to single-sex colleges. For example, in Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U.S. 455 (1973), we saw no room to distinguish between state operation of racially segregated schools and state support of privately run segregated schools. ""Racial discrimination in state-operated schools is barred by the Constitution and `[i]t is also axiomatic that a state may not induce, encourage or promote private persons to accomplish what it is constitutionally forbidden to accomplish.' "" Id., at 465 (quoting Lee v. Macon County Bd. of Ed., 267 F. Supp. 458, 475-476 (MD Ala. 1967)); see also Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 19 (1958) (""State support of segregated schools through any arrangement, management, funds, or property cannot be squared with the [Fourteenth] Amendment's command that no State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws""); Grove City College v. Bell, 465 U.S. 555, 565 (1984) (case arising under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and stating that ""[t]he economic effect of direct and indirect assistance often is indistinguishable""). When the Government was pressed at oral argument concerning the implications of these cases for private single-sex education if government-provided single-sex education is unconstitutional, *600 it stated that the implications will not be so disastrous, since States can provide funding to racially segregated private schools, ""depend[ing] on the circumstances,"" Tr. of Oral Arg. 56. I cannot imagine what those ""circumstances"" might be, and it would be as foolish for privateschool administrators to think that that assurance from the Justice Department will outlive the day it was made, as it was for VMI to think that the Justice Department's ""unequivoca[l]"" support for an intermediate-scrutiny standard in this litigation would survive the Government's loss in the courts below.
The only hope for state-assisted single-sex private schools is that the Court will not apply in the future the principles of law it has applied today. That is a substantial hope, I am happy and ashamed to say. After all, did not the Court today abandon the principles of law it has applied in our earlier sex-classification cases? And does not the Court positively invite private colleges to rely upon our ad-hocery by assuring them this litigation is ""unique""? I would not advise the foundation of any new single-sex college (especially an all-male one) with the expectation of being allowed to receive any government support; but it is too soon to abandon in despair those single-sex colleges already in existence. It will certainly be possible for this Court to write a future opinion that ignores the broad principles of law set forth today, and that characterizes as utterly dispositive the opinion's perceptions that VMI was a uniquely prestigious allmale institution, conceived in chauvinism, etc., etc. I will not join that opinion.

* * *
Justice Brandeis said it is ""one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country."" New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 311 *601 (1932) (dissenting opinion). But it is one of the unhappy incidents of the federal system that a self-righteous Supreme Court, acting on its Members' personal view of what would make a ""`more perfect Union,' "" ante, at 558 (a criterion only slightly more restrictive than a ""more perfect world""), can impose its own favored social and economic dispositions nationwide. As today's disposition, and others this single Term, show, this places it beyond the power of a ""single courageous State,"" not only to introduce novel dispositions that the Court frowns upon, but to reintroduce, or indeed even adhere to, disfavored dispositions that are centuries old. See, e. g., BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559 (1996); Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996). The sphere of self-government reserved to the people of the Republic is progressively narrowed.
In the course of this dissent, I have referred approvingly to the opinion of my former colleague, Justice Powell, in Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718 (1982). Many of the points made in his dissent apply with equal force herein particular, the criticism of judicial opinions that purport to be ""narro[w]"" but whose ""logic"" is ""sweepin[g]."" Id., at 745-746, n. 18. But there is one statement with which I cannot agree. Justice Powell observed that the Court's decision in Hogan, which struck down a single-sex program offered by the Mississippi University for Women, had thereby ""[l]eft without honor . . . an element of diversity that has characterized much of American education and enriched much of American life."" Id., at 735. Today's decision does not leave VMI without honor; no court opinion can do that.
In an odd sort of way, it is precisely VMI's attachment to such old-fashioned concepts as manly ""honor"" that has made it, and the system it represents, the target of those who today succeed in abolishing public single-sex education. The record contains a booklet that all first-year VMI students *602 (the so-called ""rats"") were required to keep in their possession at all times. Near the end there appears the following period piece, entitled ""The Code of a Gentleman"":
""Without a strict observance of the fundamental Code of Honor, no man, no matter how `polished,' can be considered a gentleman. The honor of a gentleman demands the inviolability of his word, and the incorruptibility of his principles. He is the descendant of the knight, the crusader; he is the defender of the defenseless and the champion of justice . . . or he is not a Gentleman.
""A Gentleman . . .
""Does not discuss his family affairs in public or with acquaintances.
""Does not speak more than casually about his girl friend.
""Does not go to a lady's house if he is affected by alcohol. He is temperate in the use of alcohol.
""Does not lose his temper; nor exhibit anger, fear, hate, embarrassment, ardor or hilarity in public.
""Does not hail a lady from a club window.
""A gentleman never discusses the merits or demerits of a lady.
""Does not mention names exactly as he avoids the mention of what things cost.
""Does not borrow money from a friend, except in dire need. Money borrowed is a debt of honor, and must be repaid as promptly as possible. Debts incurred by a deceased parent, brother, sister or grown child are assumed by honorable men as a debt of honor.
""Does not display his wealth, money or possessions.
""Does not put his manners on and off, whether in the club or in a ballroom. He treats people with courtesy, no matter what their social position may be.

*603 ""Does not slap strangers on the back nor so much as lay a finger on a lady.
""Does not `lick the boots of those above' nor `kick the face of those below him on the social ladder.'
""Does not take advantage of another's helplessness or ignorance and assumes that no gentleman will take advantage of him.
""A Gentleman respects the reserves of others, but demands that others respect those which are his.
""A Gentleman can become what he wills to be. . . .""
I do not know whether the men of VMI lived by this code; perhaps not. But it is powerfully impressive that a public institution of higher education still in existence sought to have them do so. I do not think any of us, women included, will be better off for its destruction.

22359,Justice Rehnquist,majority,False,Department of Housing and Urban Development v. Rucker,,2002,1.0,"With drug dealers ""increasingly imposing a reign of terror on public and other federally assisted low-income housing tenants,"" Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. § 5122, 102 Stat. 4301, 42 U.S. C. § 11901(3) (1994 ed.). The Act, as later amended, provides that each ""public housing agency shall utilize leases which . . . provide that any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other tenants or any drug-related criminal activity on or off such premises, engaged in by a public housing tenant, any member of the tenant's household, or any guest or other person under the tenant's control, shall be cause for termination of tenancy."" 42 U.S. C. § 1437d(l )(6) (1994 ed., Supp. V). Petitioners say that this statute requires lease terms that allow a local public *128 housing authority to evict a tenant when a member of the tenant's household or a guest engages in drug-related criminal activity, regardless of whether the tenant knew, or had reason to know, of that activity. Respondents say it does not. We agree with petitioners.
Respondents are four public housing tenants of the Oakland Housing Authority (OHA). Paragraph 9(m) of respondents' leases, tracking the language of § 1437d(l )(6), obligates the tenants to ""assure that the tenant, any member of the household, a guest, or another person under the tenant's control, shall not engage in . . . [a]ny drug-related criminal activity on or near the premise[s]."" App. 59. Respondents also signed an agreement stating that the tenant ""understand[s] that if I or any member of my household or guests should violate this lease provision, my tenancy may be terminated and I may be evicted."" Id., at 69.
In late 1997 and early 1998, OHA instituted eviction proceedings in state court against respondents, alleging violations of this lease provision. The complaint alleged: (1) that the respective grandsons of respondents William Lee and Barbara Hill, both of whom were listed as residents on the leases, were caught in the apartment complex parking lot smoking marijuana; (2) that the daughter of respondent Pearlie Rucker, who resides with her and is listed on the lease as a resident, was found with cocaine and a crack cocaine pipe three blocks from Rucker's apartment;[1] and (3) that on three instances within a 2-month period, respondent Herman Walker's caregiver and two others were found with cocaine in Walker's apartment. OHA had issued Walker notices of a lease violation on the first two occasions, before initiating the eviction action after the third violation.
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) regulations administering § 1437d(l )(6) require *129 lease terms authorizing evictions in these circumstances. The HUD regulations closely track the statutory language,[2] and provide that ""[i]n deciding to evict for criminal activity, the [public housing authority] shall have discretion to consider all of the circumstances of the case . . . ."" 24 CFR § 966.4(l )(5)(i) (2001). The agency made clear that local public housing authorities' discretion to evict for drug-related activity includes those situations in which ""[the] tenant did not know, could not foresee, or could not control behavior by other occupants of the unit."" 56 Fed. Reg. 51560, 51567 (1991).
After OHA initiated the eviction proceedings in state court, respondents commenced actions against HUD, OHA, and OHA's director in United States District Court. They challenged HUD's interpretation of the statute under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S. C. § 706(2)(A), arguing that 42 U.S. C. § 1437d(l )(6) does not require lease terms authorizing the eviction of so-called ""innocent"" tenants, and, in the alternative, that if it does, then the statute is unconstitutional.[3] The District Court issued a preliminary injunction, enjoining OHA from ""terminating the leases of tenants pursuant to paragraph 9(m) of the `Tenant Lease' for drugrelated criminal activity that does not occur within the tenant's *130 apartment unit when the tenant did not know of and had no reason to know of, the drug-related criminal activity."" App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 00-1770, pp. 165a-166a.
A panel of the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that § 1437d(l )(6) unambiguously permits the eviction of tenants who violate the lease provision, regardless of whether the tenant was personally aware of the drug activity, and that the statute is constitutional. See Rucker v. Davis, 203 F.3d 627 (CA9 2000). An en banc panel of the Court of Appeals reversed and affirmed the District Court's grant of the preliminary injunction. See Rucker v. Davis, 237 F.3d 1113 (2001). That court held that HUD's interpretation permitting the eviction of so-called ""innocent"" tenants ""is inconsistent with Congressional intent and must be rejected"" under the first step of Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-843 (1984). 237 F.3d, at 1126.
We granted certiorari, 533 U.S. 976 (2001), 534 U.S. 813 (2001), and now reverse, holding that 42 U.S. C. § 1437d(l )(6) unambiguously requires lease terms that vest local public housing authorities with the discretion to evict tenants for the drug-related activity of household members and guests whether or not the tenant knew, or should have known, about the activity.
That this is so seems evident from the plain language of the statute. It provides that ""[e]ach public housing agency shall utilize leases which . . . provide that . . . any drugrelated criminal activity on or off such premises, engaged in by a public housing tenant, any member of the tenant's household, or any guest or other person under the tenant's control, shall be cause for termination of tenancy."" 42 U.S. C. § 1437d(l )(6) (1994 ed., Supp. V). The en banc Court of Appeals thought the statute did not address ""the level of personal knowledge or fault that is required for eviction."" 237 F.3d, at 1120. Yet Congress' decision not to impose any *131 qualification in the statute, combined with its use of the term ""any"" to modify ""drug-related criminal activity,"" precludes any knowledge requirement. See United States v. Monsanto, 491 U.S. 600, 609 (1989). As we have explained, ""the word `any' has an expansive meaning, that is, `one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.' "" United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997). Thus, any drug-related activity engaged in by the specified persons is grounds for termination, not just drug-related activity that the tenant knew, or should have known, about.
The en banc Court of Appeals also thought it possible that ""under the tenant's control"" modifies not just ""other person,"" but also ""member of the tenant's household"" and ""guest."" 237 F.3d, at 1120. The court ultimately adopted this reading, concluding that the statute prohibits eviction where the tenant, ""for a lack of knowledge or other reason, could not realistically exercise control over the conduct of a household member or guest."" Id., at 1126. But this interpretation runs counter to basic rules of grammar. The disjunctive ""or"" means that the qualification applies only to ""other person."" Indeed, the view that ""under the tenant's control"" modifies everything coming before it in the sentence would result in the nonsensical reading that the statute applies to ""a public housing tenant . . . under the tenant's control."" HUD offers a convincing explanation for the grammatical imperative that ""under the tenant's control"" modifies only ""other person"": ""by `control,' the statute means control in the sense that the tenant has permitted access to the premises."" 66 Fed. Reg. 28781 (2001). Implicit in the terms ""household member"" or ""guest"" is that access to the premises has been granted by the tenant. Thus, the plain language of § 1437d(l )(6) requires leases that grant public housing authorities the discretion to terminate tenancy without regard to the tenant's knowledge of the drug-related criminal activity.
*132 Comparing § 1437d(l )(6) to a related statutory provision reinforces the unambiguous text. The civil forfeiture statute that makes all leasehold interests subject to forfeiture when used to commit drug-related criminal activities expressly exempts tenants who had no knowledge of the activity: ""[N]o property shall be forfeited under this paragraph . . . by reason of any act or omission established by that owner to have been committed or omitted without the knowledge or consent of that owner."" 21 U.S. C. § 881(a)(7) (1994 ed.). Because this forfeiture provision was amended in the same Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 that created 42 U.S. C. § 1437d(l )(6), the en banc Court of Appeals thought Congress ""meant them to be read consistently"" so that the knowledge requirement should be read into the eviction provision. 237 F.3d, at 1121-1122. But the two sections deal with distinctly different matters. The ""innocent owner"" defense for drug forfeiture cases was already in existence prior to 1988 as part of 21 U.S. C. § 881(a)(7). All that Congress did in the 1988 Act was to add leasehold interests to the property interests that might be forfeited under the drug statute. And if such a forfeiture action were to be brought against a leasehold interest, it would be subject to the pre-existing ""innocent owner"" defense. But 42 U.S. C. § 1437(d)(l )(6), with which we deal here, is a quite different measure. It is entirely reasonable to think that the Government, when seeking to transfer private property to itself in a forfeiture proceeding, should be subject to an ""innocent owner defense,"" while it should not be when acting as a landlord in a public housing project. The forfeiture provision shows that Congress knew exactly how to provide an ""innocent owner"" defense. It did not provide one in § 1437d(l )(6).
The en banc Court of Appeals next resorted to legislative history. The Court of Appeals correctly recognized that reference to legislative history is inappropriate when the text of the statute is unambiguous. 237 F.3d, at 1123. Given that the en banc Court of Appeals' finding of textual ambiguity *133 is wrong, see supra, at 130-132, there is no need to consult legislative history.[4]
Nor was the en banc Court of Appeals correct in concluding that this plain reading of the statute leads to absurd results.[5] The statute does not require the eviction of any tenant *134 who violated the lease provision. Instead, it entrusts that decision to the local public housing authorities, who are in the best position to take account of, among other things, the degree to which the housing project suffers from ""rampant drug-related or violent crime,"" 42 U.S. C. § 11901(2) (1994 ed. and Supp. V), ""the seriousness of the offending action,"" 66 Fed. Reg., at 28803, and ""the extent to which the leaseholder has . . . taken all reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate the offending action,"" ibid. It is not ""absurd"" that a local housing authority may sometimes evict a tenant who had no knowledge of the drug-related activity. Such ""nofault"" eviction is a common ""incident of tenant responsibility under normal landlord-tenant law and practice."" 56 Fed. Reg., at 51567. Strict liability maximizes deterrence and eases enforcement difficulties. See Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U.S. 1, 14 (1991).
And, of course, there is an obvious reason why Congress would have permitted local public housing authorities to conduct no-fault evictions: Regardless of knowledge, a tenant who ""cannot control drug crime, or other criminal activities by a household member which threaten health or safety of other residents, is a threat to other residents and the project."" 56 Fed. Reg., at 51567. With drugs leading to ""murders, muggings, and other forms of violence against tenants,"" and to the ""deterioration of the physical environment that requires substantial government expenditures,"" 42 U.S. C. § 11901(4) (1994 ed., Supp. V), it was reasonable for Congress to permit no-fault evictions in order to ""provide public and other federally assisted low-income housing that is decent, safe, and free from illegal drugs,"" § 11901(1) (1994 ed.).
In another effort to avoid the plain meaning of the statute, the en banc Court of Appeals invoked the canon of constitutional avoidance. But that canon ""has no application in the absence of statutory ambiguity."" United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative, 532 U.S. 483, 494 (2001). ""Any other conclusion, while purporting to be an exercise in *135 judicial restraint, would trench upon the legislative powers vested in Congress by Art. I, § 1, of the Constitution."" United States v. Albertini, 472 U.S. 675, 680 (1985). There are, moreover, no ""serious constitutional doubts"" about Congress' affording local public housing authorities the discretion to conduct no-fault evictions for drug-related crime. Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 314, n. 9 (1993) (emphasis deleted).
The en banc Court of Appeals held that HUD's interpretation ""raise[s] serious questions under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,"" because it permits ""tenants to be deprived of their property interest without any relationship to individual wrongdoing."" 237 F.3d, at 1124-1125 (citing Scales v. United States, 367 U.S. 203, 224-225 (1961); Southwestern Telegraph & Telephone Co. v. Danaher, 238 U.S. 482 (1915)). But both of these cases deal with the acts of government as sovereign. In Scales, the United States criminally charged the defendant with knowing membership in an organization that advocated the overthrow of the United States Government. In Danaher, an Arkansas statute forbade discrimination among customers of a telephone company. The situation in the present cases is entirely different. The government is not attempting to criminally punish or civilly regulate respondents as members of the general populace. It is instead acting as a landlord of property that it owns, invoking a clause in a lease to which respondents have agreed and which Congress has expressly required. Scales and Danaher cast no constitutional doubt on such actions.
The Court of Appeals sought to bolster its discussion of constitutional doubt by pointing to the fact that respondents have a property interest in their leasehold interest, citing Greene v. Lindsey, 456 U.S. 444 (1982). This is undoubtedly true, and Greene held that an effort to deprive a tenant of such a right without proper notice violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. But, in the present *136 cases, such deprivation will occur in the state court where OHA brought the unlawful detainer action against respondents. There is no indication that notice has not been given by OHA in the past, or that it will not be given in the future. Any individual factual disputes about whether the lease provision was actually violated can, of course, be resolved in these proceedings.[6]
We hold that ""Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue."" Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S., at 842. Section 1437d(l )(6) requires lease terms that give local public housing authorities the discretion to terminate the lease of a tenant when a member of the household or a guest engages in drug-related activity, regardless of whether the tenant knew, or should have known, of the drug-related activity.
Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered. 
Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.

29890,Justice Scalia,dissenting,False,Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs,,2003,2.0,"44
      I join JUSTICE KENNEDY's dissent, and add one further observation: The constitutional violation that is a prerequisite to ""prophylactic"" congressional action to ""enforce"" the Fourteenth Amendment is a violation by the State against which the enforcement action is taken. There is no guilt by association, enabling the sovereignty of one State to be abridged under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment because of violations by another State, or by most other States, or even by 49 other States. We explained as much long ago in the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 14 (1883), which invalidated a portion of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, purportedly based on § 5, in part for the following reason:
    
    
      45
      ""It applies equally to cases arising in states which have the justest laws respecting the personal rights of citizens, and whose authorities are ever ready to enforce such laws as to those which arise in states that may have violated the prohibition of the amendment.""
    
    
      46
      Congress has sometimes displayed awareness of this self-evident limitation. That is presumably why the most sweeping provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 — which we upheld in City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156 (1980), as a valid exercise of congressional power under § 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment* — were restricted to States ""with a demonstrable history of intentional racial discrimination in voting,"" id., at 177.
    
    
      47
      Today's opinion for the Court does not even attempt to demonstrate that each one of the 50 States covered by 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(C) was in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. It treats ""the States"" as some sort of collective entity which is guilty or innocent as a body. ""[T]he States' record of unconstitutional participation in, and fostering of, gender-based discrimination,"" it concludes, ""is weighty enough to justify the enactment of prophylactic § 5 legislation."" Ante, at 735. This will not do. Prophylaxis in the sense of extending the remedy beyond the violation is one thing; prophylaxis in the sense of extending the remedy beyond the violator is something else. See City of Rome, supra, at 177 (""Congress could rationally have concluded that, because electoral changes by jurisdictions with a demonstrable history of intentional racial discrimination in voting create the risk of purposeful discrimination, it was proper to prohibit changes that have a discriminatory impact"" (emphasis added)).

      When a litigant claims that legislation has denied him individual rights secured by the Constitution, the court ordinarily asks first whether the legislation is constitutional as applied to him. See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 613 (1973). When, on the other hand, a federal statute is challenged as going beyond Congress's enumerated powers, under our precedents the court first asks whether the statute is unconstitutional on its face. Ante, at 727-728; Post, at 744 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting); see United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000); City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997); United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995). If the statute survives this challenge, however, it stands to reason that the court may, if asked, proceed to analyze whether the statute (constitutional on its face) can be validly applied to the litigant. In the context of § 5 prophylactic legislation applied against a State, this would entail examining whether the State has itself engaged in discrimination sufficient to support the exercise of Congress's prophylactic power.
    
    
      49
      It seems, therefore, that for purposes of defeating petitioners' challenge, it would have been enough for respondents to demonstrate that § 2612(a)(1)(C) was facially valid — i.e., that it could constitutionally be applied to some jurisdictions. See United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987). (Even that demonstration, for the reasons set forth by JUSTICE KENNEDY, has not been made.) But when it comes to an as-applied challenge, I think Nevada will be entitled to assert that the mere facts that (1) it is a State, and (2) some States are bad actors, is not enough; it can demand that it be shown to have been acting in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

      Even on this Court's view of the scope of congressional power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, see Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356 (2001); Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62 (2000); Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U.S. 627 (1999), the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 is undoubtedly valid legislation, and application of the Act to the States is constitutional; the same conclusions follow a fortiori from my own understanding of § 5, see Garrett, supra, at 376 (BREYER, J., dissenting); Kimel, supra, at 92 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); Florida Prepaid, supra, at 648 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); see also Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 650-651 (1966). I join the Court's opinion here without conceding the dissenting positions just cited or the dissenting views expressed in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v.

      Because I have never been convinced that an Act of Congress can amend the Constitution and because I am uncertain whether the congressional enactment before us was truly ""`needed to secure the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment,'"" I write separately to explain why I join the Court's judgment. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 458 (1976) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 651 (1966)).
    
    
      42
      The plain language of the Eleventh Amendment poses no barrier to the adjudication of this case because respondents are citizens of Nevada. The sovereign immunity defense asserted by Nevada is based on what I regard as the second Eleventh Amendment, which has its source in judge-made common law, rather than constitutional text. Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U.S. 1, 23 (1989) (STEVENS, J., concurring). As long as it clearly expresses its intent, Congress may abrogate that common-law defense pursuant to its power to regulate commerce ""among the several States."" U.S. Const., Art. I, § 8. The family-care provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 is unquestionably a valid exercise of a power that is ""broad enough to support federal legislation regulating the terms and conditions of state employment."" Fitzpatrick, 427 U.S., at 458 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).* Accordingly, Nevada's sovereign immunity defense is without merit.

29888,Justice Rehnquist,majority,False,Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs,,2003,2.0,"6
      The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA or Act) entitles eligible employees to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave annually for any of several reasons, including the onset of a ""serious health condition"" in an employee's spouse, child, or parent. 107 Stat. 9, 29 U.S. C. § 2612(a)(1)(C). The Act creates a private right of action to seek both equitable relief and money damages ""against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction,"" § 2617(a)(2), should that employer ""interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of ""FMLA rights, § 2615(a)(1). We hold that employees of the State of Nevada may recover money damages in the event of the State's failure to comply with the family-care provision of the Act.
    
    
      7
      Petitioners include the Nevada Department of Human Resources (Department) and two of its officers. Respondent William Hibbs (hereinafter respondent) worked for the Department's Welfare Division. In April and May 1997, he sought leave under the FMLA to care for his ailing wife, who was recovering from a car accident and neck surgery. The Department granted his request for the full 12 weeks of FMLA leave and authorized him to use the leave intermittently as needed between May and December 1997. Respondent did so until August 5, 1997, after which he did not return to work. In October 1997, the Department informed respondent that he had exhausted his FMLA leave, that no further leave would be granted, and that he must report to work by November 12, 1997. Respondent failed to do so and was terminated.
    
    
      8
      Respondent sued petitioners in the United States District Court seeking damages and injunctive and declaratory relief for, inter alia, violations of 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(C). The District Court awarded petitioners summary judgment on the grounds that the FMLA claim was barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that respondent's Fourteenth Amendment rights had not been violated. Respondent appealed, and the United States intervened under 28 U.S.C. § 2403 to defend the validity of the FMLA's application to the States. The Ninth Circuit reversed. 273 F.3d 844 (2001).
    
    
      9
      We granted certiorari, 536 U.S. 938 (2002), to resolve a split among the Courts of Appeals on the question whether an individual may sue a State for money damages in federal court for violation of § 2612(a)(1)(C). Compare Kazmier v. Widmann, 225 F.3d 519, 526, 529 (CA5 2000), with 273 F.3d 844 (case below).
    
    
      10
      For over a century now, we have made clear that the Constitution does not provide for federal jurisdiction over suits against nonconsenting States. Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 363 (2001); Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 72-73 (2000); College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 669-670 (1999); Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 54 (1996); Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 15 (1890).
    
    
      11
      Congress may, however, abrogate such immunity in federal court if it makes its intention to abrogate unmistakably clear in the language of the statute and acts pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Garrett, supra, at 363; Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U.S. 775, 786 (1991) (citing Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U.S. 223, 228 (1989)). The clarity of Congress' intent here is not fairly debatable. The Act enables employees to seek damages ""against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction,"" 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(2), and Congress has defined ""public agency"" to include both ""the government of a State or political subdivision thereof"" and ""any agency of ... a State, or a political subdivision of a State,"" §§ 203(x), 2611(4)(A)(iii). We held in Kimel that, by using identical language in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq., Congress satisfied the clear statement rule of Dellmuth. 528 U.S., at 73-78. This case turns, then, on whether Congress acted within its constitutional authority when it sought to abrogate the States' immunity for purposes of the FMLA's family-leave provision.
    
    
      12
      In enacting the FMLA, Congress relied on two of the powers vested in it by the Constitution: its Article I commerce power and its power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce that Amendment's guarantees.1 Congress may not abrogate the States' sovereign immunity pursuant to its Article I power over commerce. Seminole Tribe, supra. Congress may, however, abrogate States' sovereign immunity through a valid exercise of its § 5 power, for ""the Eleventh Amendment, and the principle of state sovereignty which it embodies, are necessarily limited by the enforcement provisions of § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment."" Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 456 (1976) (citation omitted). See also Garrett, supra, at 364; Kimel, supra, at 80.
    
    
      13
      Two provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment are relevant here: Section 5 grants Congress the power ""to enforce"" the substantive guarantees of § 1 — among them, equal protection of the laws — by enacting ""appropriate legislation."" Congress may, in the exercise of its § 5 power, do more than simply proscribe conduct that we have held unconstitutional. ""`Congress' power ""to enforce"" the Amendment includes the authority both to remedy and to deter violation of rights guaranteed thereunder by prohibiting a somewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment's text.'"" Garrett, supra, at 365 (quoting Kimel, supra, at 81); City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 536 (1997); Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 658 (1966). In other words, Congress may enact so-called prophylactic legislation that proscribes facially constitutional conduct, in order to prevent and deter unconstitutional conduct.
    
    
      14
      City of Boerne also confirmed, however, that it falls to this Court, not Congress, to define the substance of constitutional guarantees. 521 U.S., at 519-524. ""The ultimate interpretation and determination of the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive meaning remains the province of the Judicial Branch."" Kimel, 528 U.S., at 81. Section 5 legislation reaching beyond the scope of § 1's actual guarantees must be an appropriate remedy for identified constitutional violations, not ""an attempt to substantively redefine the States' legal obligations."" Id., at 88. We distinguish appropriate prophylactic legislation from ""substantive redefinition of the Fourteenth Amendment right at issue,"" id., at 81, by applying the test set forth in City of Boerne: Valid § 5 legislation must exhibit ""congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end,"" 521 U.S., at 520.
    
    
      15
      The FMLA aims to protect the right to be free from gender-based discrimination in the workplace.2 We have held that statutory classifications that distinguish between males and females are subject to heightened scrutiny. See, e.g., Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197-199 (1976). For a gender-based classification to withstand such scrutiny, it must ""serv[e] important governmental objectives,"" and ""the discriminatory means employed [must be] substantially related to the achievement of those objectives."" United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The State's justification for such a classification ""must not rely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females."" Ibid. We now inquire whether Congress had evidence of a pattern of constitutional violations on the part of the States in this area.
    
    
      16
      The history of the many state laws limiting women's employment opportunities is chronicled in — and, until relatively recently, was sanctioned by — this Court's own opinions. For example, in Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130 (1873) (Illinois), and Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U.S. 464, 466 (1948) (Michigan), the Court upheld state laws prohibiting women from practicing law and tending bar, respectively. State laws frequently subjected women to distinctive restrictions, terms, conditions, and benefits for those jobs they could take. In Muller v. Oregon, 208 U.S. 412, 419, n. 1 (1908), for example, this Court approved a state law limiting the hours that women could work for wages, and observed that 19 States had such laws at the time. Such laws were based on the related beliefs that (1) a woman is, and should remain, ""the center of home and family life,"" Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U.S. 57, 62 (1961), and (2) ""a proper discharge of [a woman's] maternal functions — having in view not merely her own health, but the well-being of the race — justif[ies] legislation to protect her from the greed as well as the passion of man,"" Muller, supra, at 422. Until our decision in Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), ""it remained the prevailing doctrine that government, both federal and state, could withhold from women opportunities accorded men so long as any `basis in reason'"" — such as the above beliefs — ""could be conceived for the discrimination."" Virginia, supra, at 531 (quoting Goesaert, supra, at 467).
    
    
      17
      Congress responded to this history of discrimination by abrogating States' sovereign immunity in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 255, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a), and we sustained this abrogation in Fitzpatrick. But state gender discrimination did not cease. ""[I]t can hardly be doubted that ... women still face pervasive, although at times more subtle, discrimination ... in the job market."" Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973). According to evidence that was before Congress when it enacted the FMLA, States continue to rely on invalid gender stereotypes in the employment context, specifically in the administration of leave benefits. Reliance on such stereotypes cannot justify the States' gender discrimination in this area. Virginia, supra, at 533. The long and extensive history of sex discrimination prompted us to hold that measures that differentiate on the basis of gender warrant heightened scrutiny; here, as in Fitzpatrick, the persistence of such unconstitutional discrimination by the States justifies Congress' passage of prophylactic § 5 legislation.
    
    
      18
      As the FMLA's legislative record reflects, a 1990 Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) survey stated that 37 percent of surveyed private-sector employees were covered by maternity leave policies, while only 18 percent were covered by paternity leave policies. S. Rep. No. 103-3, pp. 14-15 (1993). The corresponding numbers from a similar BLS survey the previous year were 33 percent and 16 percent, respectively. Ibid. While these data show an increase in the percentage of employees eligible for such leave, they also show a widening of the gender gap during the same period. Thus, stereotype-based beliefs about the allocation of family duties remained firmly rooted, and employers' reliance on them in establishing discriminatory leave policies remained widespread.3
    
    
      19
      Congress also heard testimony that ""[p]arental leave for fathers ... is rare. Even ... [w]here child-care leave policies do exist, men, both in the public and private sectors, receive notoriously discriminatory treatment in their requests for such leave."" Joint Hearing 147 (Washington Council of Lawyers) (emphasis added). Many States offered women extended ""maternity"" leave that far exceeded the typical 4-to 8-week period of physical disability due to pregnancy and childbirth,4 but very few States granted men a parallel benefit: Fifteen States provided women up to one year of extended maternity leave, while only four provided men with the same. M. Lord & M. King, The State Reference Guide to Work-Family Programs for State Employees 30 (1991). This and other differential leave policies were not attributable to any differential physical needs of men and women, but rather to the pervasive sex-role stereotype that caring for family members is women's work.5
    
    
      20
      Finally, Congress had evidence that, even where state laws and policies were not facially discriminatory, they were applied in discriminatory ways. It was aware of the ""serious problems with the discretionary nature of family leave,"" because when ""the authority to grant leave and to arrange the length of that leave rests with individual supervisors,"" it leaves ""employees open to discretionary and possibly unequal treatment."" H.R. Rep. No. 103-8, pt. 2, pp. 10-11 (1993). Testimony supported that conclusion, explaining that ""[t]he lack of uniform parental and medical leave policies in the work place has created an environment where [sex] discrimination is rampant."" 1987 Senate Labor Hearings, pt. 2, at 170 (testimony of Peggy Montes, Mayor's Commission on Women's Affairs, City of Chicago).
    
    
      21
      In spite of all of the above evidence, JUSTICE KENNEDY argues in dissent that Congress' passage of the FMLA was unnecessary because ""the States appear to have been ahead of Congress in providing gender-neutral family leave benefits,"" post, at 750, and points to Nevada's leave policies in particular, post, at 755. However, it was only ""[s]ince Federal family leave legislation was first introduced"" that the States had even ""begun to consider similar family leave initiatives."" S. Rep. No. 103-3, at 20; see also S. Rep. No. 102-68, p. 77 (1991) (minority views of Sen. Durenberger) (""[S]o few states have elected to enact similar legislation at the state level"").
    
    
      22
      Furthermore, the dissent's statement that some States ""had adopted some form of family-care leave"" before the FMLA's enactment, post, at 750, glosses over important shortcomings of some state policies. First, seven States had childcare leave provisions that applied to women only. Indeed, Massachusetts required that notice of its leave provisions be posted only in ""establishment[s] in which females are employed.""6 These laws reinforced the very stereotypes that Congress sought to remedy through the FMLA. Second, 12 States provided their employees no family leave, beyond an initial childbirth or adoption, to care for a seriously ill child or family member.7 Third, many States provided no statutorily guaranteed right to family leave, offering instead only voluntary or discretionary leave programs. Three States left the amount of leave time primarily in employers' hands.8 Congress could reasonably conclude that such discretionary family-leave programs would do little to combat the stereotypes about the roles of male and female employees that Congress sought to eliminate. Finally, four States provided leave only through administrative regulations or personnel policies, which Congress could reasonably conclude offered significantly less firm protection than a federal law.9 Against the above backdrop of limited state leave policies, no matter how generous petitioners' own may have been, see post, at 755 (dissent), Congress was justified in enacting the FMLA as remedial legislation.10
    
    
      23
      In sum, the States' record of unconstitutional participation in, and fostering of, gender-based discrimination in the administration of leave benefits is weighty enough to justify the enactment of prophylactic § 5 legislation.11
    
    
      24
      We reached the opposite conclusion in Garrett and Kimel. In those cases, the § 5 legislation under review responded to a purported tendency of state officials to make age-or disability-based distinctions. Under our equal protection case law, discrimination on the basis of such characteristics is not judged under a heightened review standard, and passes muster if there is ""a rational basis for doing so at a class-based level, even if it `is probably not true' that those reasons are valid in the majority of cases."" Kimel, 528 U.S., at 86 (quoting Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 473 (1991)). See also Garrett, 531 U.S., at 367 (""States are not required by the Fourteenth Amendment to make special accommodations for the disabled, so long as their actions toward such individuals are rational""). Thus, in order to impugn the constitutionality of state discrimination against the disabled or the elderly, Congress must identify, not just the existence of age-or disability-based state decisions, but a ""widespread pattern"" of irrational reliance on such criteria. Kimel, supra, at 90. We found no such showing with respect to the ADEA and Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). Kimel, supra, at 89; Garrett, supra, at 368.
    
    
      25
      Here, however, Congress directed its attention to state gender discrimination, which triggers a heightened level of scrutiny. See, e.g., Craig, 429 U.S., at 197-199. Because the standard for demonstrating the constitutionality of a gender-based classification is more difficult to meet than our rational-basis test—it must ""serv[e] important governmental objectives"" and be ""substantially related to the achievement of those objectives,"" Virginia, 518 U.S., at 533 — it was easier for Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations. Congress was similarly successful in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 308-313 (1966), where we upheld the Voting Rights Act of 1965: Because racial classifications are presumptively invalid, most of the States' acts of race discrimination violated the Fourteenth Amendment.
    
    
      26
      The impact of the discrimination targeted by the FMLA is significant. Congress determined:
    
    
      27
      ""Historically, denial or curtailment of women's employment opportunities has been traceable directly to the pervasive presumption that women are mothers first, and workers second. This prevailing ideology about women's roles has in turn justified discrimination against women when they are mothers or mothers-to-be."" Joint Hearing 100.
    
    
      28
      Stereotypes about women's domestic roles are reinforced by parallel stereotypes presuming a lack of domestic responsibilities for men. Because employers continued to regard the family as the woman's domain, they often denied men similar accommodations or discouraged them from taking leave. These mutually reinforcing stereotypes created a self-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that forced women to continue to assume the role of primary family caregiver, and fostered employers' stereotypical views about women's commitment to work and their value as employees. Those perceptions, in turn, Congress reasoned, lead to subtle discrimination that may be difficult to detect on a case-by-case basis.
    
    
      29
      We believe that Congress' chosen remedy, the family-care leave provision of the FMLA, is ""congruent and proportional to the targeted violation,"" Garrett, supra, at 374. Congress had already tried unsuccessfully to address this problem through Title VII and the amendment of Title VII by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k). Here, as in Katzenbach, supra, Congress again confronted a ""difficult and intractable proble[m],"" Kimel, supra, at 88, where previous legislative attempts had failed. See Katzenbach, supra, at 313 (upholding the Voting Rights Act). Such problems may justify added prophylactic measures in response. Kimel, supra, at 88.
    
    
      30
      By creating an across-the-board, routine employment benefit for all eligible employees, Congress sought to ensure that family-care leave would no longer be stigmatized as an inordinate drain on the workplace caused by female employees, and that employers could not evade leave obligations simply by hiring men. By setting a minimum standard of family leave for all eligible employees, irrespective of gender, the FMLA attacks the formerly state-sanctioned stereotype that only women are responsible for family caregiving, thereby reducing employers' incentives to engage in discrimination by basing hiring and promotion decisions on stereotypes.
    
    
      31
      The dissent characterizes the FMLA as a ""substantive entitlement program"" rather than a remedial statute because it establishes a floor of 12 weeks' leave. Post, at 754. In the dissent's view, in the face of evidence of gender-based discrimination by the States in the provision of leave benefits, Congress could do no more in exercising its § 5 power than simply proscribe such discrimination. But this position cannot be squared with our recognition that Congress ""is not confined to the enactment of legislation that merely parrots the precise wording of the Fourteenth Amendment,"" but may prohibit ""a somewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment's text."" Kimel, supra, at 81. For example, this Court has upheld certain prophylactic provisions of the Voting Rights Act as valid exercises of Congress' § 5 power, including the literacy test ban and preclearance requirements for changes in States' voting procedures. See, e.g., Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 (1966); Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112 (1970); South Carolina v. Katzenbach, supra.
    
    
      32
      Indeed, in light of the evidence before Congress, a statute mirroring Title VII, that simply mandated gender equality in the administration of leave benefits, would not have achieved Congress' remedial object. Such a law would allow States to provide for no family leave at all. Where ""[t]wo-thirds of the nonprofessional caregivers for older, chronically ill, or disabled persons are working women,"" H.R. Rep. No. 103-8, pt. 1, at 24; S. Rep. No. 103-3, at 7, and state practices continue to reinforce the stereotype of women as caregivers, such a policy would exclude far more women than men from the workplace.
    
    
      33
      Unlike the statutes at issue in City of Boerne, Kimel, and Garrett, which applied broadly to every aspect of state employers' operations, the FMLA is narrowly targeted at the faultline between work and family — precisely where sex-based overgeneralization has been and remains strongest — and affects only one aspect of the employment relationship. Compare Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 91 (2002) (discussing the ""important limitations of the [FMLA's] remedial scheme""), with City of Boerne, 521 U.S., at 532 (the ""[s]weeping coverage"" of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993); Kimel, 528 U.S., at 91 (""the indiscriminate scope of the [ADEA's] substantive requirements""); and Garrett, 531 U.S., at 361 (the ADA prohibits disability discrimination ""in regard to [any] terms, conditions, and privileges of employment"" (internal quotation marks omitted)).
    
    
      34
      We also find significant the many other limitations that Congress placed on the scope of this measure. See Florida Prepaid, 527 U.S., at 647 (""[W]here `a congressional enactment pervasively prohibits constitutional state action in an effort to remedy or to prevent unconstitutional state action, limitations of this kind tend to ensure Congress' means are proportionate to ends legitimate under § 5'"" (quoting City of Boerne, supra, at 532-533)). The FMLA requires only unpaid leave, 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1), and applies only to employees who have worked for the employer for at least one year and provided 1,250 hours of service within the last 12 months, § 2611(2)(A). Employees in high-ranking or sensitive positions are simply ineligible for FMLA leave; of particular importance to the States, the FMLA expressly excludes from coverage state elected officials, their staffs, and appointed policymakers. §§ 2611(2)(B)(i) and (3), 203(e)(2)(C). Employees must give advance notice of foreseeable leave, § 2612(e), and employers may require certification by a health care provider of the need for leave, § 2613. In choosing 12 weeks as the appropriate leave floor, Congress chose ""a middle ground, a period long enough to serve `the needs of families' but not so long that it would upset `the legitimate interests of employers.'"" Ragsdale, supra, at 94 (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 2601(b)).12 Moreover, the cause of action under the FMLA is a restricted one: The damages recoverable are strictly defined and measured by actual monetary losses, §§ 2617(a)(1)(A)(i)-(iii), and the accrual period for backpay is limited by the Act's 2-year statute of limitations (extended to three years only for willful violations), §§ 2617(c)(1) and (2).
    
    
      35
      For the above reasons, we conclude that § 2612(a)(1)(C) is congruent and proportional to its remedial object, and can ""be understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior."" City of Boerne, supra, at 532.

         Compare 29 U.S.C. § 2601(b)(1) (""It is the purpose of this Act ... to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families, to promote the stability and economic security of families, and to promote national interests in preserving family integrity"") with § 2601(b)(5) (""to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity for women and men, pursuant to [the Equal Protection C]lause"") and § 2601(b)(4) (""to accomplish [the Act's other purposes] in a manner that, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause ..., minimizes the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex""). See also S. Rep. No. 103-3, p. 16 (1993) (the FMLA ""is based not only on the Commerce Clause, but also on the guarantees of equal protection and due process embodied in the 14th Amendment""); H.R. Rep. No. 103-8, pt. 1, p. 29 (1993) (same)

         The text of the Act makes this clear. Congress found that, ""due to the nature of the roles of men and women in our society, the primary responsibility for family caretaking often falls on women, and such responsibility affects the working lives of women more than it affects the working lives of men."" 29 U.S.C. § 2601(a)(5). In response to this finding, Congress sought ""to accomplish the [Act's other] purposes ... in a manner that ... minimizes the potential for employment discriminationon the basis of sex by ensuring generally that leave is available ... on a gender-neutral basis[,] and to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity for women and men...."" §§ 2601(b)(4) and (5) (emphasis added).

         While this and other material described leave policies in the private sector, a 50-state survey also before Congress demonstrated that ""[t]he proportion and construction of leave policies available to public sector employees differs little from those offered private sector employees."" The Parental and Medical Leave Act of 1986: Joint Hearing before the Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations and the Subcommittee on Labor Standards of the House Committee on Education and Labor, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., 33 (1986) (hereinafter Joint Hearing) (statement of Meryl Frank, Director of the Yale Bush Center Infant Care Leave Project).

         See,e.g., id., at 16 (six weeks is the medically recommended pregnancy disability leave period); H.R. Rep. No. 101-28, pt. 1, p. 30 (1989) (referring to Pregnancy Discrimination Act legislative history establishing four to eight weeks as the medical recovery period for a normal childbirth).
      
      
        5
         For example, state employers' collective-bargaining agreements often granted extended ""maternity"" leave of six months to a year to women only. Gerald McEntee, President of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, testified that ""the vast majority of our contracts, even though we look upon them with great pride, really cover essentially maternity leave, and not paternity leave."" The Parental and Medical Leave Act of 1987: Hearings before the Subcommittee on Children, Family, Drugs and Alcoholism of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 385 (1987) (hereinafter 1987 Senate Labor Hearings). In addition, state leave laws often specified that catchall leave-without-pay provisions could be used for extended maternity leave, but did not authorize such leave for paternity purposes. See,e.g., Family and Medical Leave Act of 1987: Joint Hearing before the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., 2-5 (1987) (Rep. Gary Ackerman recounted suffering expressly sex-based denial of unpaid leave of absence where benefit was ostensibly available for ""child care leave"").
        Evidence pertaining to parenting leave is relevant here because state discrimination in the provision of both types of benefits is based on the same gender stereotype: that women's family duties trump those of the workplace. JUSTICE KENNEDY's dissent (hereinafter dissent) ignores this common foundation that, as Congress found, has historically produced discrimination in the hiring and promotion of women. See post, at 748-749. Consideration of such evidence does not, as the dissent contends, expand our § 5 inquiry to include ""general gender-based stereotypes in employment."" Post, at 749 (emphasis added). To the contrary, because parenting and family leave address very similar situations in which work and family responsibilities conflict, they implicate the same stereotypes.

        The dissent asserts that four of these schemes — those of Colorado, Iowa, Louisiana, and New Hampshire — concern ""pregnancy disability leave only."" Post, at 752. But Louisiana provided women with four months of such leave, which far exceeds the medically recommended pregnancy disability leave period of six weeks. See n. 4, supra. This gender-discriminatory policy is not attributable to any different physical needs of men and women, but rather to the invalid stereotypes that Congress sought to counter through the FMLA. See supra, at 731.

         Contrary to the dissent's belief, we do not hold that Congress may ""abrogat[e] state immunity from private suits whenever the State's social benefits program is not enshrined in the statutory code and provides employers with discretion,""post, at 753, or when a State does not confer social benefits ""as generous or extensive as Congress would later deem appropriate,"" post, at 752. The dissent misunderstands the purpose of the FMLA's family-leave provision. The FMLA is not a ""substantive entitlement program,"" post, at 754; Congress did not create a particular leave policy for its own sake. See infra, at 737-738. Rather, Congress sought to adjust family-leave policies in order to eliminate their reliance on, and perpetuation of, invalid stereotypes, and thereby dismantle persisting gender-based barriers to the hiring, retention, and promotion of women in the workplace. In pursuing that goal, for the reasons discussed above, supra, at 733-734 and this page, Congress reasonably concluded that state leave laws and practices should be brought within the Act.
      
      
        11
         Given the extent and specificity of the above record of unconstitutional state conduct, it is difficult to understand the dissent's accusation that we rely on ""a simple recitation of a general history of employment discrimination against women.""Post, at 746. As we stated above, our holding rests on congressional findings that, at the time the FMLA was enacted, States ""rel[ied] on invalid gender stereotypes in the employment context, specifically in the administration of leave benefits."" Supra, at 730 (emphasis added). See supra, at 730-732.
      
      
        12
         Congress established 12 weeks as a floor, thus leaving States free to provide their employees with more family-leave time if they so choose. See 29 U.S.C. § 2651(b) (""Nothing in this Act or any amendment made by this Act shall be construed to supersede any provision of any State or local law that provides greater family or medical leave rights than the rights established under this Act or any amendment made by this Act""). The dissent faults Congress for giving States this choice, arguing that the FMLA's terms do not bar States from granting more family-leave time to women than to menPost, at 756. But JUSTICE KENNEDY effectively counters his own argument in his very next breath, recognizing that such gender-based discrimination would ""run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause or Title VII."" Ibid. In crafting new legislation to remedy unconstitutional state conduct, Congress may certainly rely on and take account of existing laws. Indeed, Congress expressly did so here. See 29 U.S.C. § 2651(a) (""Nothing in this Act or any amendment made by this Act shall be construed to modify or affect any Federal or State law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of ... sex ..."")."
29891,Justice Kennedy,second_dissenting,False,Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs,,2003,2.0,"The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 makes explicit the congressional intent to invoke § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to abrogate state sovereign immunity and allow suits for money damages in federal courts. Ante, at 726-727, and n. 1. The specific question is whether Congress may impose on the States this entitlement program of its own design, with mandated minimums for leave time, and then enforce it by permitting private suits for money damages against the States. This in turn must be answered by asking whether subjecting States and their treasuries to monetary liability at the insistence of private litigants is a congruent and proportional response to a demonstrated pattern of unconstitutional conduct by the States. See ante, at 728; Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 365 (2001); City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 520 (1997). If we apply the teaching of these and related cases, the family leave provision of the Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(C), in my respectful view, is invalid to the extent it allows for private suits against the unconsenting States.
        Congress does not have authority to define the substantive content of the Equal Protection Clause; it may only shape the remedies warranted by the violations of that guarantee. City of Boerne, supra, at 519-520. This requirement has special force in the context of the Eleventh Amendment, which protects a State's fiscal integrity from federal intrusion by vesting the States with immunity from private actions for damages pursuant to federal laws. The Commerce Clause likely would permit the National Government to enact an entitlement program such as this one; but when Congress couples the entitlement with the authorization to sue the States for monetary damages, it blurs the line of accountability the State has to its own citizens. These basic concerns underlie cases such as Garrett and Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62 (2000), and should counsel far more caution than the Court shows in holding § 2612(a)(1)(C) is somehow a congruent and proportional remedy to an identified pattern of discrimination.
        The Court is unable to show that States have engaged in a pattern of unlawful conduct which warrants the remedy of opening state treasuries to private suits. The inability to adduce evidence of alleged discrimination, coupled with the inescapable fact that the federal scheme is not a remedy but a benefit program, demonstrates the lack of the requisite link between any problem Congress has identified and the program it mandated.
        In examining whether Congress was addressing a demonstrated ""pattern of unconstitutional employment discrimination by the States,"" the Court gives superficial treatment to the requirement that we ""identify with some precision the scope of the constitutional right at issue."" Garrett, supra, at 365, 368. The Court suggests the issue is ""the right to be free from gender-based discrimination in the workplace,"" ante, at 728, and then it embarks on a survey of our precedents speaking to ""[t]he history of the many state laws limiting women's employment opportunities,"" ante, at 729. All would agree that women historically have been subjected to conditions in which their employment opportunities are more limited than those available to men. As the Court acknowledges, however, Congress responded to this problem by abrogating States' sovereign immunity in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). Ante, at 729; see also Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445 (1976). The provision now before us, 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(C), has a different aim than Title VII. It seeks to ensure that eligible employees, irrespective of gender, can take a minimum amount of leave time to care for an ill relative.
        The relevant question, as the Court seems to acknowledge, is whether, notwithstanding the passage of Title VII and similar state legislation, the States continued to engage in widespread discrimination on the basis of gender in the provision of family leave benefits. Ante, at 730. If such a pattern were shown, the Eleventh Amendment would not bar Congress from devising a congruent and proportional remedy. The evidence to substantiate this charge must be far more specific, however, than a simple recitation of a general history of employment discrimination against women. When the federal statute seeks to abrogate state sovereign immunity, the Court should be more careful to insist on adherence to the analytic requirements set forth in its own precedents. Persisting overall effects of gender-based discrimination at the workplace must not be ignored; but simply noting the problem is not a substitute for evidence which identifies some real discrimination the family leave rules are designed to prevent.
        Respondents fail to make the requisite showing. The Act's findings of purpose are devoid of any discussion of the relevant evidence. See Lizzi v. Alexander, 255 F.3d 128, 135 (CA4 2001) (""In making [its] finding of purpose, Congress did not identify, as it is required to do, any pattern of gender discrimination by the states with respect to the granting of employment leave for the purpose of providing family or medical care""); see also Chittister v. Department of Community and Econ. Dev., 226 F.3d 223, 228-229 (CA3 2000) (""Notably absent is any finding concerning the existence, much less the prevalence, in public employment of personal sick leave practices that amounted to intentional gender discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause"").
        As the Court seems to recognize, the evidence considered by Congress concerned discriminatory practices of the private sector, not those of state employers. Ante, at 730-731, n.3. The statistical information compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which are the only factual findings the Court cites, surveyed only private employers. Ante, at 730. While the evidence of discrimination by private entities may be relevant, it does not, by itself, justify the abrogation of States' sovereign immunity. Garrett, 531 U.S., at 368 (""Congress' § 5 authority is appropriately exercised only in response to state transgressions"").
        The Court seeks to connect the evidence of private discrimination to an alleged pattern of unconstitutional behavior by States through inferences drawn from two sources. The first is testimony by Meryl Frank, Director of the Infant Care Leave Project, Yale Bush Center in Child Development and Social Policy, who surveyed both private and public employers in all 50 States and found little variation between the leave policies in the two sectors. Ante, at 730-731, n. 3 (citing The Parental and Medical Leave Act of 1986: Joint Hearing before the Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations and the Subcommittee on Labor Standards of the House Committee on Education and Labor, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., 33 (1986) (hereinafter Joint Hearing)). The second is a view expressed by the Washington Council of Lawyers that even ""`[w]here child-care leave policies do exist, men, both in the public and private sectors, receive notoriously discriminatory treatment in their requests for such leave.'"" Ante, at 731 (quoting Joint Hearing 147) (emphasis added by the Court).
        Both statements were made during the hearings on the proposed 1986 national leave legislation, and so preceded the Act by seven years. The 1986 bill, which was not enacted, differed in an important respect from the legislation Congress eventually passed. That proposal sought to provide parenting leave, not leave to care for another ill family member. Compare H.R. 4300, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., §§ 102(3), 103(a) (1986), with 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(C). See also L. Gladstone, Congressional Research Service Issue Brief, Family and Medical Leave Legislation, pp. 4-5, 10 (Oct. 26, 1995); Tr. of Oral Arg. 43 (statement of counsel for the United States that ""the first time that the family leave was introduced and the first time the section (5) authority was invoked was in H.R. 925,"" which was proposed in 1987). The testimony on which the Court relies concerned the discrimination with respect to the parenting leave. See Joint Hearing 31 (statement of Meryl Frank) (the Yale Bush study ""evaluate[d] the impact of the changing composition of the workplace on families with infants""); id., at 147 (statement of the Washington Council of Lawyers) (""[F]or the first time, childcare responsibilities of both natural and adoptive mothers and fathers will be legislatively protected""). Even if this isolated testimony could support an inference that private sector's gender-based discrimination in the provision of parenting leave was parallel to the behavior by state actors in 1986, the evidence would not be probative of the States' conduct some seven years later with respect to a statutory provision conferring a different benefit. The Court of Appeals admitted as much: ""We recognize that a weakness in this evidence as applied to Hibbs' case is that the BLS and Yale Bush Center studies deal only with parental leave, not with leave to care for a sick family member. They thus do not document a widespread pattern of precisely the kind of discrimination that § 2612(a)(1)(C) is intended to prevent."" 273 F.3d 844, 859 (CA9 2001).
        The Court's reliance on evidence suggesting States provided men and women with the parenting leave of different length, ante, at 731, and n. 5, suffers from the same flaw. This evidence concerns the Act's grant of parenting leave, §§ 2612(a)(1)(A), (B), and is too attenuated to justify the family leave provision. The Court of Appeals' conclusion to the contrary was based on an assertion that ""if states discriminate along gender lines regarding the one kind of leave, then they are likely to do so regarding the other."" 273 F.3d, at 859. The charge that a State has engaged in a pattern of unconstitutional discrimination against its citizens is a most serious one. It must be supported by more than conjecture.
        The Court maintains the evidence pertaining to the parenting leave is relevant because both parenting and family leave provisions respond to ""the same gender stereotype: that women's family duties trump those of the workplace."" Ante, at 732, n. 5. This sets the contours of the inquiry at too high a level of abstraction. The question is not whether the family leave provision is a congruent and proportional response to general gender-based stereotypes in employment which ""ha[ve] historically produced discrimination in the hiring and promotion of women,"" ibid.; the question is whether it is a proper remedy to an alleged pattern of unconstitutional discrimination by States in the grant of family leave. The evidence of gender-based stereotypes is too remote to support the required showing.
        The Court next argues that ""even where state laws and policies were not facially discriminatory, they were applied in discriminatory ways."" Ante, at 732. This charge is based on an allegation that many States did not guarantee the right to family leave by statute, instead leaving the decision up to individual employers, who could subject employees to ""`discretionary and possibly unequal treatment.'"" Ibid. (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 103-8, pt. 2, pp. 10-11 (1993)). The study from which the Court derives this conclusion examined ""the parental leave policies of Federal executive branch agencies,"" H.R. Rep. No. 103-8, at 10, not those of the States. The study explicitly stated that its conclusions concerned federal employees: ""`[I]n the absence of a national minimum standard for granting leave for parental purposes, the authority to grant leave and to arrange the length of that leave rests with individual supervisors, leaving Federal employees open to discretionary and possibly unequal treatment.'"" Id., at 10-11. A history of discrimination on the part of the Federal Government may, in some situations, support an inference of similar conduct by the States, but the Court does not explain why the inference is justified here.
        Even if there were evidence that individual state employers, in the absence of clear statutory guidelines, discriminated in the administration of leave benefits, this circumstance alone would not support a finding of a state-sponsored pattern of discrimination. The evidence could perhaps support the charge of disparate impact, but not a charge that States have engaged in a pattern of intentional discrimination prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment. Garrett, 531 U.S., at 372-373 (citing Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 (1976)).
        The federal-state equivalence upon which the Court places such emphasis is a deficient rationale at an even more fundamental level, however; for the States appear to have been ahead of Congress in providing gender-neutral family leave benefits. Thirty States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico had adopted some form of family-care leave in the years preceding the Act's adoption. The reports in both Houses of Congress noted this fact. H.R. Rep. No. 103-8, at 32-33; S. Rep. No. 103-3, pp. 20-21 (1993); see also Brief for State of Alabama et al. as Amici Curiae 18-22. Congressional hearings noted that the provision of family leave was ""an issue which has picked up tremendous momentum in the States, with some 21 of them having some form of family or medical leave on the books."" The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1991: Hearing on H.R. 2 before the Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations of the House Committee on Education and Labor, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., p. 4 (1991) (statement of Rep. Marge Roukema). Congress relied on the experience of the States in designing the national leave policy to be cost effective and gender neutral. S. Rep. No. 103-3, at 12-14; The Parental and Medical Leave Act of 1987: Hearings on S. 249 before the Subcommittee on Children, Family, Drugs and Alcoholism of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, pp. 194-195, 533-534 (1987). Congress also acknowledged that many States had implemented leave policies more generous than those envisioned by the Act. H.R. Rep. No. 103-8, pt. 1, at 50; S. Rep. No. 103-3, at 38. At the very least, the history of the Act suggests States were in the process of solving any existing gender-based discrimination in the provision of family leave.
        The Court acknowledges that States have adopted family leave programs prior to federal intervention, but argues these policies suffered from serious imperfections. Ante, at 733-734. Even if correct, this observation proves, at most, that programs more generous and more effective than those operated by the States were feasible. That the States did not devise the optimal programs is not, however, evidence that the States were perpetuating unconstitutional discrimination. Given that the States assumed a pioneering role in the creation of family leave schemes, it is not surprising these early efforts may have been imperfect. This is altogether different, however, from purposeful discrimination.
        The Court's lengthy discussion of the allegedly deficient state policies falls short of meeting this standard. A great majority of these programs exhibit no constitutional defect and, in fact, are authorized by this Court's precedent. The Court points out that seven States adopted leave provisions applicable only to women. Ante, at 733. Yet it must acknowledge that three of these schemes concerned solely pregnancy disability leave. Ante, at 733, n. 6 (citing 3 Colo. Code Regs. § 708-1, Rule 80.8 (2002); Iowa Code § 216.6(2) (2000); N. H. Stat. Ann. § 354-A:7(VI)(b) (Michie Supp. 2000)). Our cases make clear that a State does not violate the Equal Protection Clause by granting pregnancy disability leave to women without providing for a grant of parenting leave to men. Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484, 496-497, n. 20 (1974); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 49 (counsel for the United States conceding that Geduldig would permit this practice). The Court treats the pregnancy disability scheme of the fourth State, Louisiana, as a disguised gender-discriminatory provision of parenting leave because the scheme would permit leave in excess of the period Congress believed to be medically necessary for pregnancy disability. Ante, at 733, n. 6. The Louisiana statute, however, granted leave only for ""that period during which the female employee is disabled on account of pregnancy, child-birth, or related medical conditions."" La. Stat. Ann. § 23:1008(A)(2)(b) (West Supp. 1993) (repealed 1997). Properly administered, the scheme, despite its generous maximum, would not transform into a discriminatory ""4-month maternity leave for female employees only."" Ante, at 733, n. 6.
        The Court next observes that 12 States ""provided their employees no family leave, beyond an initial childbirth or adoption."" Ante, at 733. Four of these States are those which, as discussed above, offered pregnancy disability leave only. See ante, at 733, n. 7 (citing 3 Colo. Code Regs. § 708-1, Rule 80.8 (2002); Iowa Code § 216.6(2) (2000); La. Stat. Ann. § 23:1008(A)(2) (West Supp. 1993) (repealed 1997); N. H. Stat. Ann. § 354-A:7(VI)(b) (Michie Supp. 2000)). Of the remaining eight States, five offered parenting leave to both men and women on an equal basis; a practice which no one contends suffers from a constitutional infirmity. See ante, at 733-734, n. 7 (citing Del. Code Ann., Tit. 29, § 5116 (1997); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 337.015 (Michie 2001); Mo. Rev. Stat. § 105.271 (2000); N.Y. Lab. Law § 201-c (West 2002); U. S. Dept. of Labor, Women's Bureau, State Maternity/Family Leave Law, p. 12 (June 1993) (discussing the policy adopted by the Virginia Department of Personnel and Training)). The Court does not explain how the provision of social benefits either on a gender-neutral level (as with the parenting leave) or in a way permitted by this Court's case law (as with the pregnancy disability leave) offends the Constitution. Instead, the Court seems to suggest that a pattern of unconstitutional conduct may be inferred solely because a State, in providing its citizens with social benefits, does not make these benefits as generous or extensive as Congress would later deem appropriate.
        The Court further chastises the States for having ""provided no statutorily guaranteed right to family leave, offering instead only voluntary or discretionary leave programs."" Ante, at 733-734; see also ante, at 734 (""[F]our States provided leave only through administrative regulations or personnel policies""). The Court does not argue the States intended to enable employers to discriminate in the provision of family leave; nor, as already noted, is there evidence state employers discriminated in the administration of leave benefits. See supra, at 749-750. Under the Court's reasoning, Congress seems justified in abrogating state immunity from private suits whenever the State's social benefits program is not enshrined in the statutory code and provides employers with discretion.
        Stripped of the conduct which exhibits no constitutional infirmity, the Court's ""exten[sive] and specifi[c] ... record of unconstitutional state conduct,"" ante, at 735, n. 11, boils down to the fact that three States, Massachusetts, Kansas, and Tennessee, provided parenting leave only to their female employees, and had no program for granting their employees (male or female) family leave. See ante, at 733-734, nn. 6 and 7 (citing Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 149, § 105D (West 1997); Kan. Admin. Regs. 21-32-6(d) (2003); Tenn. Code Ann. § 4-21-408(a) (1998)). As already explained, supra, at 748-749, the evidence related to the parenting leave is simply too attenuated to support a charge of unconstitutional discrimination in the provision of family leave. Nor, as the Court seems to acknowledge, does the Constitution require States to provide their employees with any family leave at all. Ante, at 738. A State's failure to devise a family leave program is not, then, evidence of unconstitutional behavior.
        Considered in its entirety, the evidence fails to document a pattern of unconstitutional conduct sufficient to justify the abrogation of States' sovereign immunity. The few incidents identified by the Court ""fall far short of even suggesting the pattern of unconstitutional discrimination on which § 5 legislation must be based."" Garrett, 531 U. S., at 370; see also Kimel, 528 U. S., at 89-91; City of Boerne, 521 U. S., at 530-531. Juxtaposed to this evidence is the States' record of addressing gender-based discrimination in the provision of leave benefits on their own volition. See generally Brief for State of Alabama et al. as Amici Curiae 5-14.
        Our concern with gender discrimination, which is subjected to heightened scrutiny, as opposed to age-or disability-based distinctions, which are reviewed under rational standard, see Kimel, supra, at 83-84; Garrett, supra, at 366-367, does not alter this conclusion. The application of heightened scrutiny is designed to ensure gender-based classifications are not based on the entrenched and pervasive stereotypes which inhibit women's progress in the workplace. Ante, at 736. This consideration does not divest respondents of their burden to show that ""Congress identified a history and pattern of unconstitutional employment discrimination by the States."" Garrett, supra, at 368. The Court seems to reaffirm this requirement. Ante, at 729 (""We now inquire whether Congress had evidence of a pattern of constitutional violations on the part of the States ...""); see also ante, at 735 (""[T]he States' record of unconstitutional participation in, and fostering of, gender-based discrimination in the administration of leave benefits is weighty enough to justify the enactment of prophylactic § 5 legislation""). In my submission, however, the Court does not follow it. Given the insufficiency of the evidence that States discriminated in the provision of family leave, the unfortunate fact that stereotypes about women continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem would not alone support the charge that a State has engaged in a practice designed to deny its citizens the equal protection of the laws. Garrett, supra, at 369.
        The paucity of evidence to support the case the Court tries to make demonstrates that Congress was not responding with a congruent and proportional remedy to a perceived course of unconstitutional conduct. Instead, it enacted a substantive entitlement program of its own. If Congress had been concerned about different treatment of men and women with respect to family leave, a congruent remedy would have sought to ensure the benefits of any leave program enacted by a State are available to men and women on an equal basis. Instead, the Act imposes, across the board, a requirement that States grant a minimum of 12 weeks of leave per year. 29 U.S. C. § 2612(a)(1)(C). This requirement may represent Congress' considered judgment as to the optimal balance between the family obligations of workers and the interests of employers, and the States may decide to follow these guidelines in designing their own family leave benefits. It does not follow, however, that if the States choose to enact a different benefit scheme, they should be deemed to engage in unconstitutional conduct and forced to open their treasuries to private suits for damages.
        Well before the federal enactment, Nevada not only provided its employees, on a gender-neutral basis, with an option of requesting up to one year of unpaid leave, Nev. Admin. Code § 284.578(1) (1984), but also permitted, subject to approval and other conditions, leaves of absence in excess of one year, § 284.578(2). Nevada state employees were also entitled to use up to 10 days of their accumulated paid sick leave to care for an ill relative. § 284.558(1). Nevada, in addition, had a program of special ""catastrophic leave."" State employees could donate their accrued sick leave to a general fund to aid employees who needed additional leave to care for a relative with a serious illness. Nev. Rev. Stat. § 284.362(1) (1995).
        To be sure, the Nevada scheme did not track that devised by the Act in all respects. The provision of unpaid leave was discretionary and subject to a possible reporting requirement. Nev. Admin. Code § 284.578(2)(3) (1984). A congruent remedy to any discriminatory exercise of discretion, however, is the requirement that the grant of leave be administered on a gender-equal basis, not the displacement of the State's scheme by a federal one. The scheme enacted by the Act does not respect the States' autonomous power to design their own social benefits regime.
        Were more proof needed to show that this is an entitlement program, not a remedial statute, it should suffice to note that the Act does not even purport to bar discrimination in some leave programs the States do enact and administer. Under the Act, a State is allowed to provide women with, say, 24 weeks of family leave per year but provide only 12 weeks of leave to men. As the counsel for the United States conceded during the argument, a law of this kind might run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause or Title VII, but it would not constitute a violation of the Act. Tr. of Oral Arg. 49. The Act on its face is not drawn as a remedy to gender-based discrimination in family leave.
        It has been long acknowledged that federal legislation which ""deters or remedies constitutional violations can fall within the sweep of Congress' enforcement power even if in the process it prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional."" City of Boerne, 521 U. S., at 518; see also ante, at 737 (in exercising its power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress ""may prohibit `a somewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment's text'"" (quoting Kimel, 528 U. S., at 81)). The Court has explained, however, that Congress may not ""enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right is."" City of Boerne, supra, at 519. The dual requirement that Congress identify a pervasive pattern of unconstitutional state conduct and that its remedy be proportional and congruent to the violation is designed to separate permissible exercises of congressional power from instances where Congress seeks to enact a substantive entitlement under the guise of its § 5 authority.
        The Court's precedents upholding the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as a proper exercise of Congress' remedial power are instructive. In South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301 (1966), the Court concluded that the Voting Rights Act's prohibition on state literacy tests was an appropriate method of enforcing the constitutional protection against racial discrimination in voting. This measure was justified because ""Congress documented a marked pattern of unconstitutional action by the States."" Garrett, 531 U. S., at 373 (citing Katzenbach, supra, at 312, 313); see also City of Boerne, supra, at 525 (""We noted evidence in the record reflecting the subsisting and pervasive discriminatory — and therefore unconstitutional — use of literacy tests"" (citing Katzenbach, supra, at 333-334)). Congress' response was a ""limited remedial scheme designed to guarantee meaningful enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment."" Garrett, supra, at 373. This scheme was both congruent, because it ""aimed at areas where voting discrimination has been most flagrant,"" Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 315, and proportional, because it was necessary to ""banish the blight of racial discrimination in voting, which has infected the electoral process in parts of our country for nearly a century,"" id., at 308. The Court acknowledged Congress' power to devise ""strong remedial and preventive measures"" to safeguard voting rights on subsequent occasions, but always explained that these measures were legitimate because they were responding to a pattern of ""the widespread and persisting deprivation of constitutional rights resulting from this country's history of racial discrimination."" City of Boerne, supra, at 526-527 (citing Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112 (1970); City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156 (1980); Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 (1966)).
        This principle of our § 5 jurisprudence is well illustrated not only by the Court's opinions in these cases but also by the late Justice Harlan's dissent in Katzenbach v. Morgan. There, Justice Harlan contrasted his vote to invalidate a federal ban on New York state literacy tests from his earlier decision, in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, to uphold stronger remedial measures against the State of South Carolina, such as suspension of literacy tests, imposition of preclearance requirements for any changes in state voting laws, and appointment of federal voting examiners. Katzenbach v. Morgan, supra, at 659, 667; see also South Carolina v. Katzenbach, supra, at 315-323. Justice Harlan explained that in the case of South Carolina there was ""`voluminous legislative history' as well as judicial precedents supporting the basic congressional findings that the clear commands of the Fifteenth Amendment had been infringed by various state subterfuges.... Given the existence of the evil, we held the remedial steps taken by the legislature under the Enforcement Clause of the Fifteenth Amendment to be a justifiable exercise of congressional initiative."" 384 U.S., at 667 (quoting South Carolina v. Katzenbach, supra, at 309, 329-330). By contrast, the New York case, in his view, lacked a showing that ""there has in fact been an infringement of that constitutional command, that is, whether a particular state practice ... offend[ed] the command of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."" 384 U.S., at 667. In the absence of evidence that a State has engaged in unconstitutional conduct, Justice Harlan would have concluded that the literacy test ban Congress sought to impose was not an ""appropriate remedial measur[e] to redress and prevent the wrongs,"" but an impermissible attempt ""to define the substantive scope of the Amendment."" Id., at 666, 668.
        For the same reasons, the abrogation of state sovereign immunity pursuant to Title VII was a legitimate congressional response to a pattern of gender-based discrimination in employment. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445 (1976). The family leave benefit conferred by the Act is, by contrast, a substantive benefit Congress chose to confer upon state employees. See City of Boerne, supra, at 520 (""There must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end. Lacking such a connection, legislation may become substantive in operation and effect""). The plain truth is Congress did not ""ac[t] to accomplish the legitimate end of enforcing judicially-recognized Fourteenth Amendment rights, [but] instead pursued an object outside the scope of Section Five by imposing new, non-remedial legal obligations on the states."" Beck, The Heart of Federalism: Pretext Review of Means-End Relationships, 36 U. C. D. L. Rev. 407, 440 (2003).
        It bears emphasis that, even were the Court to bar unconsented federal suits by private individuals for money damages from a State, individuals whose rights under the Act were violated would not be without recourse. The Act is likely a valid exercise of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause, Art. I, § 8, cl. 3, and so the standards it prescribes will be binding upon the States. The United States may enforce these standards in actions for money damages; and private individuals may bring actions against state officials for injunctive relief under Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). What is at issue is only whether the States can be subjected, without consent, to suits brought by private persons seeking to collect moneys from the state treasury. Their immunity cannot be abrogated without documentation of a pattern of unconstitutional acts by the States, and only then by a congruent and proportional remedy. There has been a complete failure by respondents to carry their burden to establish each of these necessary propositions. I would hold that the Act is not a valid abrogation of state sovereign immunity and dissent with respect from the Court's conclusion to the contrary."
31870,Justice Ginsburg,majority,False,Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders,,2004,2.0,"Plaintiff-respondent Nancy Drew Suders alleged sexually harassing conduct by her supervisors, officers of the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP), of such severity she was forced to resign. The question presented concerns the proof burdens parties bear when a sexual harassment/constructive discharge claim of that character is asserted under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
To establish hostile work environment, plaintiffs like Suders must show harassing behavior ""sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [their] employment."" Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 67 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 22 (1993) (""[T]he very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe or pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees *134 because of their ... gender ... offends Title VII's broad rule of workplace equality.""). Beyond that, we hold, to establish ""constructive discharge,"" the plaintiff must make a further showing: She must show that the abusive working environment became so intolerable that her resignation qualified as a fitting response. An employer may defend against such a claim by showing both (1) that it had installed a readily accessible and effective policy for reporting and resolving complaints of sexual harassment, and (2) that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to avail herself of that employer-provided preventive or remedial apparatus. This affirmative defense will not be available to the employer, however, if the plaintiff quits in reasonable response to an employer-sanctioned adverse action officially changing her employment status or situation, for example, a humiliating demotion, extreme cut in pay, or transfer to a position in which she would face unbearable working conditions. In so ruling today, we follow the path marked by our 1998 decisions in Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, and Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775.

I
Because this case was decided against Suders in the District Court on the PSP's motion for summary judgment, we recite the facts, as summarized by the Court of Appeals, in the light most favorable to Suders.[1] In March 1998, the PSP hired Suders as a police communications operator for the McConnellsburg barracks. Suders v. Easton, 325 F.3d 432, 436 (CA3 2003). Suders' supervisors were Sergeant Eric D. Easton, Station Commander at the McConnellsburg barracks, Patrol Corporal William D. Baker, and Corporal Eric B. Prendergast. Ibid. Those three supervisors subjected *135 Suders to a continuous barrage of sexual harassment that ceased only when she resigned from the force. Ibid.
Easton ""would bring up [the subject of] people having sex with animals"" each time Suders entered his office. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). He told Prendergast, in front of Suders, that young girls should be given instruction in how to gratify men with oral sex. Ibid. Easton also would sit down near Suders, wearing spandex shorts, and spread his legs apart. Ibid. Apparently imitating a move popularized by television wrestling, Baker repeatedly made an obscene gesture in Suders' presence by grabbing his genitals and shouting out a vulgar comment inviting oral sex. Id., at 437. Baker made this gesture as many as five-to-ten times per night throughout Suders' employment at the barracks. Ibid. Suders once told Baker she ""`d[id]n't think [he] should be doing this'""; Baker responded by jumping on a chair and again performing the gesture, with the accompanying vulgarity. Ibid. Further, Baker would ""rub his rear end in front of her and remark `I have a nice ass, don't I?'"" Ibid. Prendergast told Suders ""`the village idiot could do her job'""; wearing black gloves, he would pound on furniture to intimidate her. Ibid.[2]
In June 1998, Prendergast accused Suders of taking a missing accident file home with her. Id., at 438. After that incident, Suders approached the PSP's Equal Employment Opportunity Officer, Virginia Smith-Elliott, and told her she ""might need some help."" Ibid. Smith-Elliott gave Suders her telephone number, but neither woman followed up on the conversation. Ibid. On August 18, 1998, Suders contacted Smith-Elliott again, this time stating that she was being harassed and was afraid. Ibid. Smith-Elliott told Suders to *136 file a complaint, but did not tell her how to obtain the necessary form. Smith-Elliott's response and the manner in which it was conveyed appeared to Suders insensitive and unhelpful. Ibid.
Two days later, Suders' supervisors arrested her for theft, and Suders resigned from the force. The theft arrest occurred in the following circumstances. Suders had several times taken a computer-skills exam to satisfy a PSP job requirement. Id., at 438-439. Each time, Suders' supervisors told her that she had failed. Id., at 439. Suders one day came upon her exams in a set of drawers in the women's locker room. She concluded that her supervisors had never forwarded the tests for grading and that their reports of her failures were false. Ibid. Regarding the tests as her property, Suders removed them from the locker room. Ibid.; App. 11, 119-120. Upon finding that the exams had been removed, Suders' supervisors devised a plan to arrest her for theft. 325 F.3d, at 438-439. The officers dusted the drawer in which the exams had been stored with a theft-detection powder that turns hands blue when touched. Id., at 439. As anticipated by Easton, Baker, and Prendergast, Suders attempted to return the tests to the drawer, whereupon her hands turned telltale blue. Ibid. The supervisors then apprehended and handcuffed her, photographed her blue hands, and commenced to question her. Ibid. Suders had previously prepared a written resignation, which she tendered soon after the supervisors detained her. Ibid. Nevertheless, the supervisors initially refused to release her. Instead, they brought her to an interrogation room, gave her warnings under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), and continued to question her. 325 F.3d, at 439. Suders reiterated that she wanted to resign, and Easton then let her leave. Ibid. The PSP never brought theft charges against her.
In September 2000, Suders sued the PSP in Federal District Court, alleging, inter alia, that she had been subjected *137 to sexual harassment and constructively discharged, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, 42 U.S. C. § 2000e et seq. App. 1, 12-13.[3] At the close of discovery, the District Court granted the PSP's motion for summary judgment. Suders' testimony, the District Court recognized, sufficed to permit a trier of fact to conclude that the supervisors had created a hostile work environment. App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a. The court nevertheless held that the PSP was not vicariously liable for the supervisors' conduct. Id., at 80a.
In so concluding, the District Court referred to our 1998 decision in Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a-78a. In Faragher, along with Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, decided the same day, the Court distinguished between supervisor harassment unaccompanied by an adverse official act and supervisor harassment attended by ""a tangible employment action."" Id., at 765; accord Faragher, 524 U. S., at 808. Both decisions hold that an employer is strictly liable for supervisor harassment that ""culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment."" Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765; accord Faragher, 524 U. S., at 808. But when no tangible employment action is taken, both decisions also hold, the employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence: ""The defense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably *138 failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise."" Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765; accord Faragher, 524 U. S., at 807.
Suders' hostile work environment claim was untenable as a matter of law, the District Court stated, because she ""unreasonably failed to avail herself of the PSP's internal procedures for reporting any harassment."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a. Resigning just two days after she first mentioned anything about harassment to Equal Employment Opportunity Officer Smith-Elliott, the court noted, Suders had ""never given [the PSP] the opportunity to respond to [her] complaints."" Ibid. The District Court did not address Suders' constructive discharge claim.[4]
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed and remanded the case for disposition on the merits. 325 F.3d, at 462. The Third Circuit agreed with the District Court that Suders had presented evidence sufficient for a trier of fact to conclude that the supervisors had engaged in a ""pattern of sexual harassment that was pervasive and regular."" Id., at 442. But the appeals court disagreed with the District Court in two fundamental respects. First, the Court of Appeals held that, even assuming the PSP could assert the affirmative defense described in Ellerth and Faragher, *139 genuine issues of material fact existed concerning the effectiveness of the PSP's ""program ... to address sexual harassment claims."" 325 F.3d, at 443. Second, the appeals court held that the District Court erred in failing to recognize that Suders had stated a claim of constructive discharge due to the hostile work environment. Ibid.[5]
A plaintiff alleging constructive discharge in violation of Title VII, the Court of Appeals stated, must establish:
""(1) he or she suffered harassment or discrimination so intolerable that a reasonable person in the same position would have felt compelled to resign . . .; and (2) the employee's reaction to the workplace situationthat is, his or her decision to resignwas reasonable given the totality of circumstances. . . ."" Id., at 445.
Viewing the complaint in that context, the court determined that Suders had raised genuine issues of material fact relating to her claim of constructive discharge. Id., at 446.
The Court of Appeals then made the ruling challenged here: It held that ""a constructive discharge, when proved, constitutes a tangible employment action."" Id., at 447. Under Ellerth and Faragher, the court observed, such an action renders an employer strictly liable and precludes employer recourse to the affirmative defense announced in those decisions. 325 F.3d, at 447. The Third Circuit recognized that the Courts of Appeals for the Second and Sixth Circuits had ruled otherwise. A constructive discharge resulting from a supervisor-created hostile work environment, both Circuits had held, does not qualify as a tangible employment action, and therefore does not stop an employer from *140 invoking the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense. 325 F.3d, at 452-453 (citing Caridad v. Metro-North Commuter R. Co., 191 F.3d 283, 294 (CA2 1999), and Turner v. Dowbrands, Inc., No. 99-3984, 2000 WL 924599, *1 (CA6, June 26, 2000) (unpublished)). The Third Circuit, however, reasoned that a constructive discharge ""`constitutes a significant change in employment status' by ending the employer-employee relationship"" and ""also inflicts the same type of `direct economic harm'"" as the tangible employment actions Ellerth and Faragher offered by way of example (discharge, demotion, undesirable reassignment). 325 F.3d, at 460 (quoting Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 761, 762). Satisfied that Suders had ""raised genuine issues of material fact as to her claim of constructive discharge,"" and that the PSP was ""precluded from asserting the affirmative defense to liability advanced in support of its motion for summary judgment,"" the Court of Appeals remanded Suders' Title VII claim for trial. 325 F.3d, at 461.
This Court granted certiorari, 540 U.S. 1046 (2003), to resolve the disagreement among the Circuits on the question whether a constructive discharge brought about by supervisor harassment ranks as a tangible employment action and therefore precludes assertion of the affirmative defense articulated in Ellerth and Faragher. Compare 325 F.3d, at 461 (constructive discharge qualifies as a tangible employment action); Jaros v. LodgeNet Entertainment Corp., 294 F.3d 960, 966 (CA8 2002) (same), with Caridad, 191 F. 3d, at 294 (constructive discharge does not qualify as a tangible employment action); Turner, 2000 WL 924599, *1 (same), and Reed v. MBNA Marketing Systems, Inc., 333 F.3d 27, 33 (CA1 2003) (constructive discharge qualifies as a tangible employment action only when effected through a supervisor's official act); Robinson v. Sappington, 351 F.3d 317, 336 (CA7 2003) (same). We conclude that an employer does not have recourse to the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense when a supervisor's official act precipitates the constructive *141 discharge; absent such a ""tangible employment action,"" however, the defense is available to the employer whose supervisors are charged with harassment. We therefore vacate the Third Circuit's judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.

II

A
Under the constructive discharge doctrine, an employee's reasonable decision to resign because of unendurable working conditions is assimilated to a formal discharge for remedial purposes. See 1 B. Lindemann & P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 838-839 (3d ed. 1996) (hereinafter Lindemann & Grossman). The inquiry is objective: Did working conditions become so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign? See C. Weirich et al., 2002 Cumulative Supplement to Lindemann & Grossman 651-652, and n. 1 (collecting cases) (hereinafter Weirich).
The constructive discharge concept originated in the labor-law field in the 1930's; the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) developed the doctrine to address situations in which employers coerced employees to resign, often by creating intolerable working conditions, in retaliation for employees' engagement in collective activities. Lieb, Constructive Discharge Under Section 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act: A Study in Undue Concern Over Motives, 7 Indus. Rel. L. J. 143, 146-148 (1985); see In re Sterling Corset Co., 9 N. L. R. B. 858, 865 (1938) (first case to use term ""constructive discharg[e]""). Over the next two decades, Courts of Appeals sustained NLRB constructive discharge rulings. See, e. g., NLRB v. East Texas Motor Freight Lines, 140 F.2d 404, 405 (CA5 1944) (first Circuit case to hold supervisor-caused resignation an unfair labor practice); NLRB v. Saxe-Glassman Shoe Corp., 201 F.2d 238, 243 (CA1 1953) (first Circuit case to allow backpay award for *142 constructive discharge). By 1964, the year Title VII was enacted, the doctrine was solidly established in the federal courts. See Comment, That's It, I Quit: Returning to First Principles in Constructive Discharge Doctrine, 23 Berkeley J. Emp. & Lab. L. 401, 410 (2002).
The Courts of Appeals have recognized constructive discharge claims in a wide range of Title VII cases. See, e. g., Robinson, 351 F. 3d, at 336-337 (sexual harassment); Moore v. KUKA Welding Systems & Robot Corp., 171 F.3d 1073, 1080 (CA6 1999) (race); Bergstrom-Ek v. Best Oil Co., 153 F.3d 851, 858-859 (CA8 1998) (pregnancy); Amirmokri v. Baltimore Gas & Elec. Co., 60 F.3d 1126, 1132-1133 (CA4 1995) (national origin); Derr v. Gulf Oil Corp., 796 F.2d 340, 343 (CA10 1986) (sex); Young v. Southwestern Sav. & Loan Assn., 509 F.2d 140, 143-144 (CA5 1975) (religion). See also Goss v. Exxon Office Systems Co., 747 F.2d 885, 887 (CA3 1984) (""[A]pplication of the constructive discharge doctrine to Title VII cases has received apparently universal recognition among the courts of appeals which have addressed that issue.""); 3 L. Larson, Labor and Employment Law § 59.05[8] (2003) (collecting cases). And the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency charged with implementing Title VII, has stated: An employer ""is responsible for a constructive discharge in the same manner that it is responsible for the outright discriminatory discharge of a charging party."" 2 EEOC Compliance Manual § 612.9(a) (2002).
Although this Court has not had occasion earlier to hold that a claim for constructive discharge lies under Title VII, we have recognized constructive discharge in the labor-law context, see Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U.S. 883, 894 (1984) (NLRB may find employer engaged in unfair labor practice ""when, for the purpose of discouraging union activity, ... [the employer] creates working conditions so intolerable that the employee has no option but to resigna so-called `constructive discharge.'""). Furthermore, we have stated that *143 ""Title VII is violated by either explicit or constructive alterations in the terms or conditions of employment."" Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 752. See also Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S., at 64 (""The phrase `terms, conditions, or privileges of employment' [in Title VII] evinces a congressional intent to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women in employment."" (some internal quotation marks omitted)). We agree with the lower courts and the EEOC that Title VII encompasses employer liability for a constructive discharge.

B
This case concerns an employer's liability for one subset of Title VII constructive discharge claims: constructive discharge resulting from sexual harassment, or ""hostile work environment,"" attributable to a supervisor. Our starting point is the framework Ellerth and Faragher established to govern employer liability for sexual harassment by supervisors.[6] As earlier noted, see supra, at 137-138, those decisions delineate two categories of hostile work environment claims: (1) harassment that ""culminates in a tangible employment action,"" for which employers are strictly liable, Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765; accord Faragher, 524 U. S., at 808, and (2) harassment that takes place in the absence of a tangible employment action, to which employers may assert an affirmative defense, Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765; accord Faragher, 524 U. S., at 807. With the background set out above in mind, we turn to the key issues here at stake: Into which Ellerth/Faragher category do hostile-environment constructive discharge claims falland what proof burdens do the parties bear in such cases.
In Ellerth and Faragher, the plaintiffs-employees sought to hold their employers vicariously liable for sexual harassment by their supervisors, even though the plaintiffs ""suffer[ed] *144 no adverse, tangible job consequences."" Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 747. Setting out a framework for employer liability in those decisions, this Court noted that Title VII's definition of ""employer"" includes the employer's ""agent[s],"" 42 U.S. C. § 2000e(b). See Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 754. We viewed that definition as a direction to ""interpret Title VII based on agency principles."" Ibid. The Restatement (Second) of Agency (1957) (hereinafter Restatement), the Court noted, states (in its black-letter formulation) that an employer is liable for the acts of its agent when the agent ""`was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.'"" Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 758 (quoting Restatement § 219(2)(d)); accord Faragher, 524 U. S., at 801.
We then identified ""a class of cases where, beyond question, more than the mere existence of the employment relation aids in commission of the harassment: when a supervisor takes a tangible employment action against the subordinate."" Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 760. A tangible employment action, the Court explained, ""constitutes a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits."" Id., at 761. Unlike injuries that could equally be inflicted by a co-worker, we stated, tangible employment actions ""fall within the special province of the supervisor,"" who ""has been empowered by the company as . . . [an] agent to make economic decisions affecting other employees under his or her control."" Id., at 762. The tangible employment action, the Court elaborated, is, in essential character, ""an official act of the enterprise, a company act."" Ibid. It is ""the means by which the supervisor brings the official power of the enterprise to bear on subordinates."" Ibid. Often, the supervisor will ""use [the company's] internal processes"" and thereby ""obtain the imprimatur of the enterprise."" Ibid. Ordinarily, the tangible employment decision ""is documented in official company records, and may be subject to review by *145 higher level supervisors."" Ibid. In sum, we stated, ""when a supervisor takes a tangible employment action against a subordinate[,] ... it would be implausible to interpret agency principles to allow an employer to escape liability."" Id., at 762-763.
When a supervisor's harassment of a subordinate does not culminate in a tangible employment action, the Court next explained, it is ""less obvious"" that the agency relation is the driving force. Id., at 763. We acknowledged that a supervisor's ""power and authority invests his or her harassing conduct with a particular threatening character, and in this sense, a supervisor always is aided by the agency relation."" Ibid. But we also recognized that ""there are acts of harassment a supervisor might commit which might be the same acts a coemployee would commit, and there may be some circumstances where the supervisor's status [would] mak[e] little difference."" Ibid.
An ""aided-by-the-agency-relation"" standard, the Court suggested, was insufficiently developed to press into service as the standard governing cases in which no tangible employment action is in the picture. Looking elsewhere for guidance, we focused on Title VII's design ""to encourage the creation of antiharassment policies and effective grievance mechanisms."" Id., at 764. The Court reasoned that tying the liability standard to an employer's effort to install effective grievance procedures would advance Congress' purpose ""to promote conciliation rather than litigation"" of Title VII controversies. Ibid. At the same time, such linkage of liability limitation to effective preventive and corrective measures could serve Title VII's deterrent purpose by ""encourag[ing] employees to report harassing conduct before it becomes severe or pervasive."" Ibid. Accordingly, we held that when no tangible employment action is taken, the employer may defeat vicarious liability for supervisor harassment by establishing, as an affirmative defense, both that ""the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct *146 promptly any sexually harassing behavior,"" and that ""the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise."" Id., at 765; accord Faragher, 524 U. S., at 807.
Ellerth and Faragher also clarified the parties' respective proof burdens in hostile environment cases. Title VII, the Court noted, ""borrows from tort law the avoidable consequences doctrine,"" Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 764, under which victims have ""a duty `to use such means as are reasonable under the circumstances to avoid or minimize the damages' that result from violations of the statute,"" Faragher, 524 U. S., at 806 (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC, 458 U.S. 219, 231, n. 15 (1982)). The Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense accommodates that doctrine by requiring plaintiffs reasonably to stave off avoidable harm. But both decisions place the burden squarely on the defendant to prove that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to avoid or reduce harm. Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765; accord Faragher, 524 U. S., at 807; cf. C. McCormick, Law of Damages 130 (1935) (defendant has burden of persuading factfinder ""plaintiff could reasonably have reduced his loss or avoided injurious consequences"").[7]

1
The constructive discharge here at issue stems from, and can be regarded as an aggravated case of, sexual harassment or hostile work environment. For an atmosphere of sexual harassment or hostility to be actionable, we reiterate, see supra, at 133-134, the offending behavior ""must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's *147 employment and create an abusive working environment."" Meritor, 477 U. S., at 67 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). A hostile-environment constructive discharge claim entails something more: A plaintiff who advances such a compound claim must show working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign. See, e. g., Breeding v. Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., 164 F.3d 1151, 1160 (CA8 1999) (""[A]lthough there may be evidence from which a jury could find sexual harassment, ... the facts alleged [for constructive discharge must be] ... so intolerable that a reasonable person would be forced to quit.""); Perry v. Harris Chernin, Inc., 126 F.3d 1010, 1015 (CA7 1997) (""[U]nless conditions are beyond `ordinary' discrimination, a complaining employee is expected to remain on the job while seeking redress."").[8]
Suders' claim is of the same genre as the hostile work environment claims the Court analyzed in Ellerth and Faragher.[9] Essentially, Suders presents a ""worse case"" harassment scenario, *148 harassment ratcheted up to the breaking point. Like the harassment considered in our pathmarking decisions, harassment so intolerable as to cause a resignation may be effected through co-worker conduct, unofficial supervisory conduct, or official company acts. Unlike an actual termination, which is always effected through an official act of the company, a constructive discharge need not be. A constructive discharge involves both an employee's decision to leave and precipitating conduct: The former involves no official action; the latter, like a harassment claim without any constructive discharge assertion, may or may not involve official action. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24.
To be sure, a constructive discharge is functionally the same as an actual termination in damages-enhancing respects. See supra, at 147, n. 8. As the Third Circuit observed, both ""en[d] the employer-employee relationship,"" and both ""inflic[t] ... direct economic harm."" 325 F.3d, at 460 (internal quotation marks omitted). But when an official act does not underlie the constructive discharge, the Ellerth and Faragher analysis, we here hold, calls for extension of the affirmative defense to the employer. As those leading decisions indicate, official directions and declarations are the acts most likely to be brought home to the employer, the measures over which the employer can exercise greatest control. See Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 762. Absent ""an official act of the enterprise,"" ibid., as the last straw, the employer ordinarily would have no particular reason to suspect that a resignation is not the typical kind daily occurring in the work force. And as Ellerth and Faragher further point out, an official act reflected in company recordsa demotion or a reduction in compensation, for exampleshows ""beyond question"" that the supervisor has used his managerial or controlling position to the employee's disadvantage. See Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 760. Absent such an official act, the extent to which the supervisor's misconduct has been aided by the agency relation, as we earlier recounted, see supra, at *149 145, is less certain. That uncertainty, our precedent establishes, see supra, at 145-146, justifies affording the employer the chance to establish, through the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense, that it should not be held vicariously liable.
The Third Circuit drew the line differently. Under its formulation, the affirmative defense would be eliminated in all hostile-environment constructive discharge cases, but retained, as Ellerth and Faragher require, in ""ordinary"" hostile work environment cases, i. e., cases involving no tangible employment action. That placement of the line, anomalously, would make the graver claim of hostile-environment constructive discharge easier to prove than its lesser included component, hostile work environment. Moreover, the Third Circuit's formulation, that court itself recognized, would make matters complex, indeed, more than a little confusing to jurors. Creation of a hostile work environment is a necessary predicate to a hostile-environment constructive discharge case. Juries would be so informed. Under the Third Circuit's decision, a jury, presumably, would be cautioned to consider the affirmative-defense evidence only in reaching a decision on the hostile work environment claim, and to ignore or at least downplay that same evidence in deciding the closely associated constructive discharge claim. It makes scant sense thus to alter the decisive instructions from one claim to the next when the only variation between the two claims is the severity of the hostile working conditions. Cf. Faragher, 524 U. S., at 801 (affirming ""the virtue of categorical clarity"").
We note, finally, two recent Court of Appeals decisions that indicate how the ""official act"" (or ""tangible employment action"") criterion should play out when constructive discharge is alleged. Both decisions advance the untangled approach we approve in this opinion. In Reed v. MBNA Marketing Systems, Inc., 333 F.3d 27 (CA1 2003), the plaintiff claimed a constructive discharge based on her supervisor's *150 repeated sexual comments and an incident in which he sexually assaulted her. The First Circuit held that the alleged wrongdoing did not preclude the employer from asserting the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense. As the court explained in Reed, the supervisor's behavior involved no official actions. Unlike, ""e. g., an extremely dangerous job assignment to retaliate for spurned advances,"" 333 F.3d, at 33, the supervisor's conduct in Reed ""was exceedingly unofficial and involved no direct exercise of company authority""; indeed, it was ""exactly the kind of wholly unauthorized conduct for which the affirmative defense was designed,"" ibid. In contrast, in Robinson v. Sappington, 351 F.3d 317 (CA7 2003), after the plaintiff complained that she was sexually harassed by the judge for whom she worked, the presiding judge decided to transfer her to another judge, but told her that ""her first six months [in the new post] probably would be `hell,'"" and that it was in her ""`best interest to resign.'"" Id., at 324. The Seventh Circuit held that the employer was precluded from asserting the affirmative defense to the plaintiff's constructive discharge claim. The Robinson plaintiff's decision to resign, the court explained, ""resulted, at least in part, from [the presiding judge's] official actio[n] in transferring"" her to a judge who resisted placing her on his staff. Id., at 337. The courts in Reed and Robinson properly recognized that Ellerth and Faragher, which divided the universe of supervisor-harassment claims according to the presence or absence of an official act, mark the path constructive discharge claims based on harassing conduct must follow.

2
In its summation, the Third Circuit qualified its holding that a constructive discharge itself ""constitutes a tangible employment action within the meaning of Ellerth and Faragher."" 325 F.3d, at 462. The affirmative defense Ellerth and Faragher delineated, the court said, might be imported into the anterior issue whether ""the employee's decision *151 to resign was reasonable under the circumstances."" 325 F.3d, at 462.[10] As the Third Circuit expressed its thinking:
""[I]t may be relevant to a claim of constructive discharge whether an employer had an effective remedial scheme in place, whether an employer attempted to investigate, or otherwise to address, plaintiff's complaints, and whether plaintiff took advantage of alternatives offered by antiharassment programs."" Ibid.

These considerations, the Third Circuit recognized, ""are, of course, the same considerations relevant to the affirmative defense in Ellerth and Faragher."" Ibid.
The Third Circuit left open when and how the Ellerth/Faragher considerations would be brought home to the fact trier. It did not address specifically the allocation of pleading and persuasion burdens. It simply relied on ""the wisdom and expertise of trial judges to exercise their gatekeeping authority when assessing whether all, some, or none of the evidence relating to employers' antiharassment programs and to employees' exploration of alternative avenues warrants introduction at trial."" 325 F.3d, at 463.
*152 We see no cause for leaving the district courts thus unguided. Following Ellerth and Faragher, the plaintiff who alleges no tangible employment action has the duty to mitigate harm, but the defendant bears the burden to allege and prove that the plaintiff failed in that regard. See supra, at 146. The plaintiff might elect to allege facts relevant to mitigation in her pleading or to present those facts in her case in chief, but she would do so in anticipation of the employer's affirmative defense, not as a legal requirement.

*   *   *
We agree with the Third Circuit that the case, in its current posture, presents genuine issues of material fact concerning Suders' hostile work environment and constructive discharge claims.[11] We hold, however, that the Court of Appeals erred in declaring the affirmative defense described in Ellerth and Faragher never available in constructive discharge cases. Accordingly, we vacate the Third Circuit's judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered."
31871,Justice Thomas,dissenting,False,Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders,,2004,2.0,"As the Court explains, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) developed the concept of constructive discharge to address situations in which employers coerced employees into resigning because of the employees' involvement in union activities. See ante, at 141-142. In light of this specific focus, the NLRB requires employees to establish two elements to prove a constructive discharge. First, the employer must impose burdens upon the employee that ""cause, and [are] intended to cause, a change in his working conditions so difficult or unpleasant as to force him to resign. *153 Second, it must be shown that those burdens were imposed because of the employee's union activities."" Crystal Princeton Refining Co., 222 N. L. R. B. 1068, 1069 (1976).
When the constructive discharge concept was first imported into Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, some courts imposed similar requirements. See, e. g., Muller v. United States Steel Corp., 509 F.2d 923, 929 (CA10 1975) (requiring a showing that ""an employer deliberately render[ed] the employee's working conditions intolerable and thus force[d] him to quit his job""). Moreover, because the Court had not yet recognized the hostile work environment cause of action, the first successful Title VII constructive discharge claims typically involved adverse employment actions. See, Muller, supra (denial of job promotion); Derr v. Gulf Oil Corp., 796 F.2d 340, 344 (CA10 1986) (demotion). If, in order to establish a constructive discharge, an employee must prove that his employer subjected him to an adverse employment action with the specific intent of forcing the employee to quit, it makes sense to attach the same legal consequences to a constructive discharge as to an actual discharge.
The Court has now adopted a definition of constructive discharge, however, that does not in the least resemble actual discharge. The Court holds that to establish ""`constructive discharge,'"" a plaintiff must ""show that the abusive working environment became so intolerable that [the employee's] resignation qualified as a fitting response."" Ante, at 134. Under this rule, it is possible to allege a constructive discharge absent any adverse employment action. Moreover, a majority of Courts of Appeals have declined to impose a specific intent or reasonable foreseeability requirement. See, e. g., Brooks v. San Mateo, 229 F.3d 917, 930 (CA9 2000) (""[C]onstructive discharge occurs when the working conditions deteriorate, as a result of discrimination, to the point that they become sufficiently extraordinary and egregious to overcome the normal motivation of a competent, *154 diligent, and reasonable employee to remain on the job to earn a livelihood and to serve his or her employer"" (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Thus, as it is currently conceived, a ""constructive"" discharge does not require a ""company ac[t] that can be performed only by the exercise of specific authority granted by the employer,"" Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 768 (1998) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (i.e., an adverse employment action), nor does it require that the act be undertaken with the same purpose as an actual discharge. Under these circumstances, it no longer makes sense to view a constructive discharge as equivalent to an actual discharge. Instead, as the Court points out, a constructive discharge is more akin to ""an aggravated case of ... sexual harassment or hostile work environment."" Ante, at 146. And under this ""hostile work environment plus"" framework, the proper standard for determining employer liability is the same standard for hostile work environment claims that I articulated in Burlington Industries, Inc., supra. ""An employer should be liable if, and only if, the plaintiff proves that the employer was negligent in permitting the supervisor's conduct to occur."" Id., at 767. If a supervisor takes an adverse employment action because of sex that directly results in the constructive discharge, the employer is vicariously liable. Id., at 768. But, where the alleged constructive discharge results only from a hostile work environment, an employer is liable if negligent. Ibid. Because respondent has not adduced sufficient evidence of an adverse employment action taken because of her sex, nor has she proffered any evidence that petitioner knew or should have known of the alleged harassment, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

33053,Justice Souter,majority,False,AT&T Corp. v. Hulteen,,2009,1.0,"The question is whether an employer necessarily vio
lates the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), 42 U.S. C.
§2000e(k), when it pays pension benefits calculated in part
under an accrual rule, applied only prior to the PDA, that
gave less retirement credit for pregnancy leave than for
medical leave generally. We hold there is no necessary
violation; and the benefit calculation rule in this case is
part of a bona fide seniority system under §703(h) of Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S. C. §2000e–

pensions and other benefits based on a seniority system
that relies upon an employee’s term of employment, un
derstood as the period of service at the company minus
uncredited leave time.2
   In the 1960s and early to mid-1970s, AT&T employees
on “disability” leave got full service credit for the entire
periods of absence, but those who took “personal” leaves of
absence received maximum service credit of 30 days.
Leave for pregnancy was treated as personal, not disabil
ity. AT&T altered this practice in 1977 by adopting its
Maternity Payment Plan (MPP), entitling pregnant em
ployees to disability benefits and service credit for up to
six weeks of leave. If the absence went beyond six weeks,
however, it was treated as personal leave, with no further
benefits or credit, whereas employees out on disability
unrelated to pregnancy continued to receive full service
credit for the duration of absence. This differential treat
ment of pregnancy leave, under both the pre-1977 plan
and the MPP, was lawful: in General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert,
429 U.S. 125 (1976), this Court concluded that a disability

divestiture of the Bell Operating Companies in 1984, these women
became employees of AT&T Corporation and their service calculations,
as computed by PT&T under its accrual rules, were carried over to
AT&T Corporation.
  2 AT&T’s calculation of a term of employment is a more complicated

endeavor, requiring the creation and maintenance of an individual
“start date” for each employee, which is adjusted based on the relevant
leave policy.

was not sex-based discrimination within the meaning of
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as
amended, 42 U.S. C. §2000e et seq.
   In 1978, Congress amended Title VII by passing the
PDA, 92 Stat. 2076, 42 U.S. C. §2000e(k), which super
seded Gilbert so as to make it “clear that it is discrimina
tory to treat pregnancy-related conditions less favorably
than other medical conditions.” Newport News Shipbuild
ing & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U.S. 669, 684 (1983).
On April 29, 1979, the effective date of the PDA, AT&T
adopted its Anticipated Disability Plan which replaced the
MPP and provided service credit for pregnancy leave on
the same basis as leave taken for other temporary disabili
ties. AT&T did not, however, make any retroactive ad
justments to the service credit calculations of women who
had been subject to the pre-PDA personnel policies.
   Four of those women are named respondents in this
case. Each of them received less service credit for preg
nancy leave than she would have accrued on the same
leave for disability: seven months less for Noreen Hulteen;
about six months for Eleanora Collet; and about two for
Elizabeth Snyder and Linda Porter.             Respondents
Hulteen, Collet, and Snyder have retired from AT&T;
respondent Porter has yet to. If her total term of employ
ment had not been decreased due to her pregnancy leave,
each would be entitled to a greater pension benefit.
   Eventually, each of the individual respondents and
respondent Communications Workers of America (CWA),
the collective-bargaining representative for the majority of
AT&T’s nonmanagement employees, filed charges of dis
crimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC), alleging discrimination on the basis
of sex and pregnancy in violation of Title VII. In 1998, the
EEOC issued a Letter of Determination finding reasonable
cause to believe that AT&T had discriminated against
respondent Hulteen and “a class of other similarly

ment of service] date has been used to determine eligibil
ity for a service or disability pension, the amount of pen
sion benefits, and eligibility for certain other benefits and
programs, including early retirement offerings.” App. 54–
55. The EEOC issued a notice of right to sue to each
named respondent and the CWA (collectively, Hulteen),
and Hulteen filed suit in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of California.
   On dueling motions for summary judgment, the District
Court held itself bound by a prior Ninth Circuit decision,
Pallas v. Pacific Bell, 940 F.2d 1324 (1991), which found a
Title VII violation where post-PDA retirement eligibility
calculations incorporated pre-PDA accrual rules that
differentiated on the basis of pregnancy. See App. to Pet.
for Cert. 121a–122a. The Circuit, en banc, affirmed and
held that Pallas’s conclusion that “calculation of service
credit excluding time spent on pregnancy leave violates
Title VII was, and is, correct.” 498 F.3d 1001, 1003
(2007).
   The Ninth Circuit’s decision directly conflicts with the
holdings of the Sixth and Seventh Circuits that reliance on
a pre-PDA differential accrual rule to determine pension
benefits does not constitute a current violation of Title VII.
See Ameritech Benefit Plan Comm. v. Communication
Workers of Am., 220 F.3d 814 (CA7 2000) (finding no
actionable Title VII violation given the existence of a bona
fide seniority system); Leffman v. Sprint Corp., 481 F.3d
428 (CA6 2007) (characterizing claim as challenging the
continuing effects of past discrimination rather than
alleging a current Title VII violation). We granted certio
rari in order to resolve this split, 554 U. S. __ (2008), and
now reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.

sex.” 42 U.S. C. §2000e–2(a)(1). Generally, a claim under
Title VII must be filed “within one hundred and eighty
days after the alleged unlawful employment practice
occurred,” §2000e–5(e)(1). In this case, Hulteen has iden
tified the challenged practice as applying the terms of
AT&T’s seniority system to calculate and pay pension
benefits to women who took pregnancy leaves before April
29, 1979. She says the claim is timely because the old
service credit differential for pregnancy leave was carried
forward through the system’s calculations so as to produce
an effect in the amount of the benefit when payments
began.
   There is no question that the payment of pension bene
fits in this case is a function of a seniority system, given
the fact that calculating benefits under the pension plan
depends in part on an employee’s term of employment. As
we have said, “[a] ‘seniority system’ is a scheme that, alone
or in tandem with non-‘seniority’ criteria, allots to employ
ees ever improving employment rights and benefits as
their relative lengths of pertinent employment increase.”
California Brewers Assn. v. Bryant, 444 U.S. 598, 605–
606 (1980) (footnote omitted). Hulteen is also undoubtedly
correct that AT&T’s personnel policies affecting the calcu
lation of any employee’s start date should be considered
“ancillary rules” and elements of the system, necessary for
it to operate at all, being rules that “define which passages
of time will ‘count’ towards the accrual of seniority and
which will not.” Id., at 607.
   But contrary to Hulteen’s position, establishing the
continuity of a seniority system whose results depend in
part on obsolete rules entailing disadvantage to once
pregnant employees does not resolve this case. Although
adopting a service credit rule unfavorable to those out on

pregnancy leave would violate Title VII today, a seniority
system does not necessarily violate the statute when it
gives current effect to such rules that operated before the
PDA. “[S]eniority systems are afforded special treatment
under Title VII,” Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison,
432 U.S. 63, 81 (1977), reflecting Congress’s understand
ing that their stability is valuable in its own right. Hence,
§703(h):
     “Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchap
     ter, it shall not be an unlawful employment practice
     for an employer to apply different standards of com
     pensation, or different terms, conditions, or privileges
     of employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority . . .
     system . . . provided that such differences are not the
     result of an intention to discriminate because of race,
     color, religion, sex, or national origin . . . .” 42 U.S. C.
     §2000e–2(h).
Benefit differentials produced by a bona fide seniority
based pension plan are permitted unless they are “the
result of an intention to discriminate.” Ibid.3
——————
   3 Section 701(k) of Title VII provides that “women affected by preg

nancy, . . . shall be treated the same for all employment-related pur
poses, including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs, as
other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to
work, and nothing in section [703(h)] of this title shall be interpreted to
permit otherwise.” 42 U.S. C. §2000e(k). Hulteen contends that, in
light of this language, §703(h) does not apply at all to claims of fringe
benefit discrimination under the PDA. We cannot agree. Hulteen’s
reading would result in the odd scenario that pregnancy discrimination,
alone among all categories of discrimination (race, color, religion, other
sex-based claims, and national origin), would receive dispensation from
the general application of subsection (h).
   A better explanation is that §701(k) refers only to the final sentence
of §703(h), which reads that “[i]t shall not be an unlawful employment
practice under this subchapter for any employer to differentiate upon
the basis of sex in determining the amount of the wages or compensa
tion paid or to be paid to employees of such employer if such differen

                          Opinion of the Court

   In Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324 (1977),
advantages of a seniority system flowed disproportionately
to white, as against minority, employees, because of an
employer’s prior discrimination in job assignments. We
recognized that this “disproportionate distribution of
advantages does in a very real sense operate to freeze the
status quo of prior discriminatory employment practices[,]
[b]ut both the literal terms of §703(h) and the legislative
history of Title VII demonstrate that Congress considered
this very effect of many seniority systems and extended a
measure of immunity to them.” Id., at 350 (internal quota
tion marks omitted). “[T]he unmistakable purpose of
§703(h) was to make clear that the routine application of a
bona fide seniority system would not be unlawful under
Title VII.” Id., at 352. The seniority system in Teamsters
exemplified a bona fide system without any discriminatory
terms (the discrimination having occurred in executive
action hiring employees and assigning jobs), so that the
Court could conclude that the system “did not have its
genesis in . . . discrimination, and . . . has been maintained
free from any illegal purpose.” Id., at 356.
   AT&T’s system must also be viewed as bona fide, that

—————— 

tiation is authorized by the provisions of section 206(d) of title 29.” 42

U.S. C. §2000e–2(h). This final sentence of subsection (h), referred to
as the Bennett Amendment, served to reconcile the Equal Pay Act of
1963, 77 Stat. 56, 29 U.S. C. §206(d), with Title VII. See County of
Washington v. Gunther, 452 U.S. 161, 194 (1981) (Rehnquist, J.,
dissenting). In General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125 (1976), this
Court had concluded that the amendment permitted wage discrimina
tion based on pregnancy. Id., at 144–145. By adding the language,
“nothing in section [703(h)] of this title shall be interpreted to permit
otherwise,” to the PDA, 42 U.S. C. §2000e(k), Congress wanted to
ensure that, in addition to replacing Gilbert with a rule that discrimi
nation on the basis of pregnancy is sex discrimination, it foreclosed the
possibility that this Court’s interpretation of the Bennett Amendment
could be construed, going forward, to permit wage discrimination based
on pregnancy.

                          Opinion of the Court

is, as a system that has no discriminatory terms, with the
consequence that subsection (h) controls the result here,
just as in Teamsters. It is true that in this case the pre-
April 29, 1979 rule of differential treatment was an ele
ment of the seniority system itself; but it did not taint the
system under the terms of subsection (h), because this
Court held in Gilbert that an accrual rule limiting the
seniority credit for time taken for pregnancy leave did not
unlawfully discriminate on the basis of sex. As a matter of
law, at that time, “an exclusion of pregnancy from a dis
ability-benefits plan providing general coverage [was] not
a gender-based discrimination at all.” 429 U.S., at 136.4
Although the PDA would have made it discriminatory to
continue the accrual policies of the old rule, AT&T
amended that rule as of the effective date of the Act, April
29, 1979; the new one, treating pregnancy and other tem
porary disabilities the same way, remains a part of
AT&T’s seniority system today.
   This account of litigation, legislation, and the evolution
of the system’s terms is the answer to Hulteen’s argument
that Teamsters supports her position. She correctly points
out that a “seniority system that perpetuates the effects of

——————
  4 Gilbert recognized that differential treatment could still represent

intentionally discriminatory treatment if pretextual, 429 U.S., at 136,
and that a forbidden discriminatory effect could result if a disability
benefits plan produced overall preferential treatment for one sex, id., at
138. Neither theory is advanced here.
  In Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty, 434 U.S. 136 (1977), we reaffirmed our
holding in Gilbert that Title VII “did not require that greater economic
benefits be paid to one sex or the other ‘because of their differing roles
in “the scheme of human existence.” ’ ” Id., at 142 (quoting Gilbert,
supra, at 139, n. 17). But we noted that Gilbert’s holding did not
extend to “permit an employer to burden female employees in such a
way as to deprive them of employment opportunities because of their
different role.” Satty, supra, at 142. Cancellation of benefits previously
accrued, therefore, was considered facially violative at the time, but
such a situation is not presented here.

pre-Act discrimination cannot be bona fide if an intent to
discriminate entered into its very adoption,” 431 U.S., at
346, n. 28, and she would characterize AT&T’s seniority
system as intentionally discriminatory, on the theory that
the accrual rule for pregnancy leave was facially discrimi
natory from the start. She claims further support from
Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S.
187 (1991), in which we said that “explicit facial discrimi
nation does not depend on why the employer discriminates
but rather on the explicit terms of the discrimination,” and
that such facial discrimination is intentional discrimina
tion even if not based on any underlying malevolence. Id.,
at 199. Hulteen accordingly claims that the superseded
differential affecting current benefits was, and remains,
“discriminatory in precisely the way the PDA prohibits,”
Brief for Respondents 18.
   But Automobile Workers is not on point. The policy in
that case, prohibiting women from working in jobs with
lead exposure unless they could show themselves incapa
ble of child bearing, was put in place after the PDA be
came law and under its terms was facially discriminatory.
In this case, however, AT&T’s intent when it adopted the
pregnancy leave rule (before the PDA) was to give differ
ential treatment that as a matter of law, as Gilbert held,
was not gender-based discrimination. Because AT&T’s
differential accrual rule was therefore a permissible dif
ferentiation given the law at the time, there was nothing
in the seniority system at odds with the subsection (h)
bona fide requirement. The consequence is that subsec
tion (h) is as applicable here as it was in Teamsters, and
the calculations of credited service that determine pen
sions are the results of a permissibly different standard
under subsection (h) today.5

10                    AT&T CORP. v. HULTEEN

                          Opinion of the Court

  The only way to conclude here that the subsection would
not support the application of AT&T’s system would be to
read the PDA as applying retroactively to recharacterize
the acts as having been illegal when done, contra Gilbert.6
But this is not a serious possibility. As we have said,
     “[b]ecause it accords with widely held intuitions about
     how statutes ordinarily operate, a presumption
     against retroactivity will generally coincide with legis
     lative and public expectations. Requiring clear intent
     assures that Congress itself has affirmatively consid
     ered the potential unfairness of retroactive applica
     tion and determined that it is an acceptable price to
     pay for the countervailing benefits.” Landgraf v. USI
     Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 272–273 (1994).
There is no such clear intent here, indeed, no indication at
all that Congress had retroactive application in mind; the
evidence points the other way. Congress provided for the
PDA to take effect on the date of enactment, except in its
application to certain benefit programs, as to which effec
tiveness was held back 180 days. Act of Oct. 31, 1978,
§2(b), 92 Stat. 2076, 42 U.S. C. §2000e(k) (1979 ed.). The
House Report adverted to these benefit schemes:
     “As the Gilbert decision permits employers to exclude
——————
tuted sex discrimination under Title VII, this Court in Gilbert clearly
rejected that conclusion, 429 U.S., at 147 (Brennan, J., dissenting); see
also id., at 162 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Gilbert declared the meaning
and scope of sex discrimination under Title VII and held that previous
views to the contrary were wrong as a matter of law. And “[a] judicial
construction of a statute is an authoritative statement of what the
statute meant before as well as after the decision of the case giving rise
to that construction.” Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U.S. 298,
312–313 (1994); see also id., at 313, n. 12. It is therefore to no avail to
argue that the pregnancy leave cap was unlawful before Gilbert and
that the PDA returned the law to its prior state.
  6 In so saying, we assume that §701(k) has no application, as ex

plained in footnote 3, supra. Cf. post, at 4–6 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting).

                     Opinion of the Court

    pregnancy-related coverage from employee benefit
    plans, [the bill] provides for [a] transition period of
    180 days to allow employees [sic] to comply with the
    explicit provisions of this amendment. It is the com
    mittee’s intention to provide for an orderly and equi
    table transition, with the least disruption for employ
    ers and employees, consistent with the purposes of the
    bill.” H. R. Rep. No. 95–948, p. 8 (1978).
This is the language of prospective intent, not retrospec
tive revision.
   Hulteen argues that she nonetheless has a challenge to
AT&T’s current payment of pension benefits under
§706(e)(2) of Title VII, believing (again mistakenly) that
this subsection affects the validity of any arrangement
predating the PDA that would be facially discriminatory if
instituted today. Brief for Respondents 27–29. Section
706(e)(2) provides that
    “an unlawful employment practice occurs, with re
    spect to a seniority system that has been adopted for
    an intentionally discriminatory purpose in violation of
    this subchapter (whether or not that discriminatory
    purpose is apparent on the face of the seniority provi
    sion), when the seniority system is adopted, when an
    individual becomes subject to the seniority system, or
    when a person aggrieved is injured by the application
    of the seniority system or provision of the system.” 42
    U.S. C. §2000e–5(e)(2).
But, as the text makes clear, this subsection determines
the moments at which a seniority system violates Title VII
only if it is a system “adopted for an intentionally dis
criminatory purpose in violation of this subchapter.” As
discussed above, the Court has unquestionably held that
the feature of AT&T’s seniority system at issue was not
discriminatory when adopted, let alone intentionally so in
violation of this subchapter. That leaves §706(e)(2) with
12                    AT&T CORP. v. HULTEEN

                          Opinion of the Court

out any application here.
   It is equally unsound for Hulteen to argue that when
she retired AT&T could have chosen to give post-PDA
credit to pre-PDA pregnancy leave, making its failure to
do so facially discriminatory at that time.7 If a choice to
rely on a favorable statute turned every past differentia
tion into contemporary discrimination, subsection (h)
would never apply.
   Hulteen’s remaining argument (as of the time the case
was submitted to us) is that our decision in Bazemore v.
Friday, 478 U.S. 385 (1986) (per curiam), is on her side.
In Bazemore, black employees of the North Carolina Agri
cultural Extension Service, who received less pay than
comparable whites under a differential compensation plan
extending back to pre-Title VII segregation, brought suit
in 1971 claiming that pay disparities persisted. Id., at
389–391. We concluded that “[a] pattern or practice that
would have constituted a violation of Title VII, but for the
fact that the statute had not yet become effective, became
a violation upon Title VII’s effective date, and to the ex
tent an employer continued to engage in that act or prac
tice, it is liable under that statute.” Id., at 395.
   Bazemore has nothing to say here. To begin with, it did
not involve a seniority system subject to subsection (h);
rather, the employer in Bazemore had a racially based pay
structure under which black employees were paid less
than white employees. Further, after Title VII became
law, the employer failed to eliminate the discriminatory
practice, even though the new statute had turned what
once was legally permissible into something unlawful.
Bazemore would be on point only if, after the PDA, AT&T

  7 Tothe extent Hulteen means to claim, as a factual matter, that the
accrual rule was merely advisory, requiring a fresh choice to apply it in
the benefit context, she points to nothing in the record supporting such
a proposition.

                     Opinion of the Court

continued to apply an unfavorable credit differential for
pregnancy leave simply because it had begun to do that
before the PDA. AT&T’s system, by contrast, provides
future benefits based on past, completed events, that were
entirely lawful at the time they occurred.
                          III
  We have accepted supplemental briefing after the ar
gument on the possible effect on this case of the recent
amendment to §706(e) of Title VII, adopted in response to
Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U.S. 618
(2007), and dealing specifically with discrimination in
compensation:
    “For purposes of this section, an unlawful employment
    practice occurs, with respect to discrimination in com
    pensation in violation of this title, when a discrimina
    tory compensation decision or other practice is
    adopted, when an individual becomes subject to a dis
    criminatory compensation decision or other practice,
    or when an individual is affected by application of a
    discriminatory compensation decision or other prac
    tice, including each time wages, benefits, or other
    compensation is paid, resulting in whole or in part
    from such a decision or other practice.” Lilly Ledbetter
    Fair Pay Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111–2, §3(A), 123 Stat.
    5–6.
Hulteen argues that payment of the pension benefits at
issue in this case marks the moment at which she “is
affected by application of a discriminatory compensation
decision or other practice,” and she reads the statute as
providing that such a “decision or other practice” may not
be applied to her disadvantage.
  But the answer to this claim is essentially the same as
the answer to Hulteen’s argument that §706(e)(2) helps
her, supra, at 11–12. For the reasons already discussed,
14                AT&T CORP. v. HULTEEN

                     Opinion of the Court

AT&T’s pre-PDA decision not to award Hulteen service
credit for pregnancy leave was not discriminatory, with
the consequence that Hulteen has not been “affected by
application of a discriminatory compensation decision or
other practice.” §3(A), 123 Stat. 6.
                             IV
   Bona fide seniority systems allow, among other
things, for predictable financial consequences, both for the
employer who pays the bill and for the employee who gets
the benefit. Cf. Central Laborers’ Pension Fund v. Heinz,
541 U.S. 739, 743 (2004) (noting that the central feature
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
29 U.S. C. §1001 et seq., is its “object of protecting em
ployees’ justified expectations of receiving the benefits
their employers promise them”). As §703(h) demonstrates,
Congress recognized the salience of these reliance inter
ests and, where not based upon or resulting from an inten
tion to discriminate, gave them protection. Because the
seniority system run by AT&T is bona fide, the judgment
of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed.

                                            It is so ordered.

EEOC. In generations preceding—and lingering long
after—the passage of Title VII, that history demonstrates,
societal attitudes about pregnancy and motherhood se
verely impeded women’s employment opportunities. See
Molnar, “Has the Millennium Yet Dawned?”: A History of
Attitudes Toward Pregnant Workers in America, 12 Mich.
J. Gender & L. 163, 170–176 (2005); S. Kamerman, A.
Kahn, & P. Kingston, Maternity Policies and Working
Women 32–38 (1983).
   Congress swiftly reacted to the Gilbert decision. Less
than two years after the Court’s ruling, Congress passed
the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA) to over
turn Gilbert and make plain the legislators’ clear under
standing that discrimination based on pregnancy is dis
crimination against women.3 The Act amended Title VII
to require that women affected by pregnancy “be treated
the same for all employment-related purposes, including
receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs, as other
persons not so affected but similar in their ability or in
ability to work.” 42 U.S. C. §2000e(k).
   The PDA does not require redress for past discrimina
tion. It does not oblige employers to make women whole
for the compensation denied them when, prior to the Act,
they were placed on pregnancy leave, often while still
ready, willing, and able to work, and with no secure right
to return to their jobs after childbirth.4 But the PDA does

women will become pregnant and leave the labor force . . . is at the root
of the discriminatory practices which keep women in low-paying and
dead-end jobs.”).

Dept. of Employment Security, 423 U.S. 44 (1975) (per curiam) (state

protect women, from and after April 1979, when the Act
became fully effective, against repetition or continuation of
pregnancy-based disadvantageous treatment.
  Congress interred Gilbert more than 30 years ago, but
the Court today allows that wrong decision still to hold
sway. The plaintiffs (now respondents) in this action will
receive, for the rest of their lives, lower pension benefits
than colleagues who worked for AT&T no longer than they
did. They will experience this discrimination not simply
because of the adverse action to which they were subjected
pre-PDA. Rather, they are harmed today because AT&T
has refused fully to heed the PDA’s core command: Here
after, for “all employment-related purposes,” disadvanta
geous treatment “on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or
related medical conditions” must cease.          42 U.S. C.
§2000e(k) (emphasis added). I would hold that AT&T
committed a current violation of Title VII when, post-PDA,
it did not totally discontinue reliance upon a pension
calculation premised on the notion that pregnancy-based
classifications display no gender bias.
                             I
  Enacted as an addition to the section defining terms
used in Title VII, the PDA provides:
       “The terms ‘because of sex’ or ‘on the basis of sex’
     include, but are not limited to, because of or on the
     basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical con
     ditions; and women affected by pregnancy, childbirth,
     or related medical conditions shall be treated the
     same for all employment-related purposes, including

school teachers to take unpaid maternity leave five months before the
expected date of childbirth, with no guarantee of re-employment). Cf.

stereotypes about “women when they are mothers or mothers-to-be”
(internal quotation marks omitted)).

The text of the Act, this Court has acknowledged, “unam
biguously expressed [Congress’] disapproval of both the
holding and the reasoning of the Court in the Gilbert
decision.” Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v.
EEOC, 462 U.S. 669, 678 (1983). “Proponents of the
[PDA],” the Court observed, “repeatedly emphasized that
the Supreme Court had erroneously interpreted congres
sional intent and that amending legislation was necessary
to reestablish the principles of Title VII law as they had
been understood prior to the Gilbert decision.” Id., at 679.
See also California Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Guerra, 479
U.S. 272, 284–285 (1987) (explaining that “the first clause
of the PDA reflects Congress’ disapproval of the reasoning
in Gilbert,” while “the second clause . . . illustrate[s] how
discrimination against pregnancy is to be remedied”). Cf.
Newport News, 462 U.S., at 694 (Rehnquist, J., dissent
ing) (criticizing the Court for concluding that the PDA
“renders all of Gilbert obsolete”).
   Today’s case presents a question of time. As the Court
comprehends the PDA, even after the effective date of the
Act, lower pension benefits perpetually can be paid to
women whose pregnancy leaves predated the PDA. As to
those women, the Court reasons, the disadvantageous
treatment remains as Gilbert declared it to be: “facially
nondiscriminatory,” and without “any gender-based dis
criminatory effect,” 429 U.S., at 138. See ante, at 8.
   There is another way to read the PDA, one better at
tuned to Congress’ “unambiguou[s] . . . disapproval of both
the holding and the reasoning” in Gilbert. Newport News,
462 U.S., at 678. On this reading, the Act calls for an
immediate end to any pretense that classification on the
basis of pregnancy can be “facially nondiscriminatory.”

                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting

While the PDA does not reach back to redress discrimina
tion women encountered before Congress overruled Gil
bert, the Act instructs employers forthwith to cease and
desist: From and after the PDA’s effective date, classifica
tions treating pregnancy disadvantageously must be
recognized, “for all employment-related purposes,” includ
ing pension payments, as discriminatory both on their face
and in their impact. So comprehended, the PDA requires
AT&T to pay Noreen Hulteen and others similarly
situated pension benefits untainted by pregnancy-based
discrimination.
                              II
   The Court’s rejection of plaintiffs’ claims to pension
benefits undiminished by discrimination “because of
[their] sex,” 42 U.S. C. §2000e–2(h), centers on §703(h) of
Title VII, as construed by this Court in Teamsters v.
United States, 431 U.S. 324 (1977). See ante, at 4–8.
Section 703(h) permits employers “to apply different stan
dards of compensation . . . pursuant to a bona fide senior
ity . . . system.” 42 U.S. C. §2000e–2(h). Congress en
acted §703(h), Teamsters explained, to “exten[d] a measure
of immunity” to seniority systems even when they “operate
to ‘freeze’ the status quo of prior discriminatory employ
ment practices.” 431 U.S., at 350 (quoting Griggs v. Duke
Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 430 (1971)).
   Teamsters involved a seniority system attacked under
Title VII as perpetuating race-based discrimination.
Minority group members ranked low on the seniority list
because, pre-Title VII, they were locked out of the job
category in question. But the seniority system itself, the
Court reasoned, “did not have its genesis in . . . discrimi
nation,” contained no discriminatory terms, and applied
“equally to all races and ethnic groups,” 431 U.S., at 355–
356. Therefore, the Court concluded, §703(h) sheltered the
system despite its adverse impact on minority group

members only recently hired for, or allowed to transfer
into, more desirable jobs. See id., at 356.
   This case differs from Teamsters because AT&T’s senior
ity system itself was infected by an overt differential. Cf.
ante, at 8 (“[R]ule of differential treatment was an element
of the seniority system itself . . . .”). One could scarcely
maintain that AT&T’s scheme was “neutral on [its] face
and in intent,” discriminating against women only “in
effect.” Cf. Teamsters, 431 U.S., at 349. Surely not a
term fairly described as “equally [applicable] to all,” id., at
355, AT&T’s prescription regarding pregnancy leave
would gain no immunity under §703(h) but for this Court’s
astonishing declaration in Gilbert: “[E]xclusion of preg
nancy from a disability-benefits plan providing general
coverage,” the Court decreed, “[was] not a gender-based
discrimination at all.” 429 U.S., at 136. See ante, at 8
(because of Gilbert, AT&T’s disadvantageous treatment of
pregnancy leave “did not taint the system under the terms
of [§703(h)]”).
   Were the PDA an ordinary instance of legislative revi
sion by Congress in response to this Court’s construction
of a statutory text, I would not dissent from today’s deci
sion. But Congress made plain its view that Gilbert was
not simply wrong about the character of a classification
that treats leave necessitated by pregnancy and childbirth
disadvantageously. In disregarding the opinions of other
courts, see supra, at 2, n. 2, of the agency that superin
tends enforcement of Title VII, see supra, at 2,5 and, most

  5 The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s (EEOC) current
Compliance Manual counsels: “While the denial of service credit to
women on maternity leave was not unlawful when [the charging party]
took her leave . . . , the employer’s decision to incorporate that denial of
service credit in calculating seniority [post-PDA] is discriminatory.” 2

EEOC compliance manuals, this Court has recognized, “reflect ‘a body

fundamentally, the root cause of discrimination against
women in the paid labor force, this Court erred egre
giously. Congress did not provide a remedy for pregnancy
based discrimination already experienced before the PDA
became effective. I am persuaded by the Act’s text and
legislative history, however, that Congress intended no
continuing reduction of women’s compensation, pension
benefits included, attributable to their placement on preg
nancy leave.
                             III
    A few further considerations influence my dissenting
view. Seeking equal treatment only from and after the
PDA’s effective date, plaintiffs present modest claims. As
the Court observes, they seek service credit, for pension
benefit purposes, for the periods of their pregnancy leaves.
For the named plaintiffs, whose claims are typical, the
uncounted leave days are these: “seven months . . . for
Noreen Hulteen; about six months for Eleanora Collet;
and about two for Elizabeth Snyder and Linda Porter.”
Ante, at 3. See also 498 F.3d 1001, 1004 (CA9 2007) (en
banc) (case below). Their demands can be met without
disturbing settled expectations of other workers, the core
concern underlying the shelter §703(h) provides for senior
ity systems. See Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co., 424 U.S.
747, 766, 773, and n. 33 (1976) (“ ‘benefit’ seniority,” unlike
“ ‘competitive status’ seniority,” does not conflict with
economic interests of other employees).
    Furthermore, as Judge Rymer explained in her opinion
dissenting from the Ninth Circuit’s initial panel opinion,
441 F.3d 653, 665–666 (2006), the relief plaintiffs request
is not retroactive in character. Plaintiffs request no back
pay or other compensation for past injury. They seek

pension benefits, now and in the future, equal to the bene
fits received by others employed for the same length of
time. The actionable conduct of which they complain is
AT&T’s denial of equal benefits to plaintiffs “in the post-
PDA world.” Id., at 667.
   Nor does it appear that equal benefits for plaintiffs
during their retirement years would expose AT&T to an
excessive or unmanageable cost. The plaintiffs’ class is
not large; it comprises only women whose pregnancy
leaves predated April 29, 1979 and whose employment
continued long enough for their pensions to vest. The
periods of service involved are short—several weeks or
some months, not years. And the cost of equal treatment
would be spread out over many years, as eligible women
retire.
                              IV
   Certain attitudes about pregnancy and childbirth,
throughout human history, have sustained pervasive,
often law-sanctioned, restrictions on a woman’s place
among paid workers and active citizens. This Court so
recognized in Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs,
538 U.S. 721 (2003). Hibbs rejected challenges, under the
Eleventh and Fourteenth Amendments, to the Family and
Medical Leave Act of 1993, 107 Stat. 6, 29 U.S. C. §2601
et seq., as applied to state employees. The Court’s opinion
featured Congress’ recognition that,
    “[h]istorically, denial or curtailment of women’s em
    ployment opportunities has been traceable directly to
    the pervasive presumption that women are mothers
    first, and workers second. This prevailing ideology
    about women’s roles has in turn justified discrimina

    ers-to-be.” Joint Hearing before the Subcommittee on

  Several of our own decisions, the opinion in Hibbs ac
knowledged, 538 U.S., at 729, exemplified the once “pre
vailing ideology.” As prime illustrations, the Court cited
Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130 (1873);7 Muller v. Oregon,
208 U.S. 412 (1908);8 Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U.S. 464
(1948);9 and Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U.S. 57 (1961).10 The
Hibbs opinion contrasted Muller, Goesaert, and Hoyt with
more recent opinions: Commencing in 1971, the Court had
shown increasing awareness that traditional sex-based
classifications confined or depressed women’s oppor-
tunities. 538 U.S., at 728–730. Representative of the
jurisprudential change, Hibbs cited Reed v. Reed, 404
U.S. 71 (1971);11 Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677

the stereotype that all women are marginal workers. Until a woman
passes the child-bearing age, she is viewed by employers as potentially
pregnant.”).
   7 Bradwell upheld a State’s exclusion of women from the practice of

law. In an exorbitant concurring opinion, Justice Bradley wrote that
“the female sex [is] evidently unfi[t] . . . for many of the occupations of
civil life.” 16 Wall., at 141. He elaborated: “The paramount destiny
and mission of woman are to fulfil the noble and benign offices of wife
and mother. This is the law of the Creator.” Ibid.
   8 Muller upheld a State’s hours-of-work limitation applicable to

women only. “[T]o preserve the strength and vigor of the race,” the
Court observed, “the physical well-being of woman becomes an object of
public interest and care.” 208 U.S., at 421. Cf. Automobile Workers v.
Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187, 211 (1991) (“Concern for a
woman’s existing or potential offspring historically has been the excuse
for denying women equal employment opportunities.”).
   9 Goesaert upheld a state law prohibiting women from working as

bartenders (unless the woman’s husband or father owned the tavern).
   10 Hoyt sustained a state law exempting all women from the obliga

tion to serve on juries.
   11 Reed invalidated a state law that preferred males to females for

appointment as estate administrators.

  Gilbert is aberrational not simply because it placed
outside Title VII disadvantageous treatment of pregnancy
rooted in “stereotype-based beliefs about the allocation of
family duties,” Hibbs, 538 U.S., at 730; Gilbert also ad
vanced the strange notion that a benefits classification
excluding some women (“pregnant women”) is not sex
based because other women are among the favored class
(“nonpregnant persons”).15 The very first Title VII sex
discrimination case heard by the Court, Phillips v. Martin
Marietta Corp., 400 U.S. 542 (1971) (per curiam), how
ever, rejected similar reasoning. At issue in Phillips was
an employer’s refusal to hire mothers of pre-school-age
children. Phillips yielded a per curiam opinion recogniz
ing that Title VII applies to classifications disadvanta
geous to some, but not most, women. See, e.g., Phillips v.

observation. In response to an employer’s argument that
its disadvantageous maternity leave and pregnancy dis

swift and strong repudiation of Gilbert, the Court today
holds, does not warrant any redress for the plaintiffs in
this case. They must continue to experience the impact of
their employer’s discriminatory—but, for a short time,
Gilbert-blessed—plan. That outcome is far from inevita
ble. It is at least reasonable to read the PDA to say, from
and after the effective date of the Act, no woman’s pension
payments are to be diminished by the pretense that preg
nancy-based discrimination displays no gender bias.
  I would construe the Act to embrace plaintiffs’ com
plaint, and would explicitly overrule Gilbert so that the
decision can generate no more mischief.

of the leading institutions of higher education in the Na-
tion. Admission is prized and competitive. In 2008, when
petitioner sought admission to the University’s entering
class, she was 1 of 29,501 applicants. From this group
12,843 were admitted, and 6,715 accepted and enrolled.
Petitioner was denied admission.
   In recent years the University has used three different
programs to evaluate candidates for admission. The first
is the program it used for some years before 1997, when
the University considered two factors: a numerical score
reflecting an applicant’s test scores and academic perform-
ance in high school (Academic Index or AI), and the
applicant’s race. In 1996, this system was held unconsti-
tutional by the United States Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit. It ruled the University’s consideration of
race violated the Equal Protection Clause because it did
not further any compelling government interest. Hopwood
v. Texas, 78 F.3d 932, 955 (1996).
   The second program was adopted to comply with the
Hopwood decision. The University stopped considering
race in admissions and substituted instead a new holistic
metric of a candidate’s potential contribution to the Uni-
versity, to be used in conjunction with the Academic In-
dex. This “Personal Achievement Index” (PAI) measures a
student’s leadership and work experience, awards, extra-
curricular activities, community service, and other special
circumstances that give insight into a student’s back-

ground. These included growing up in a single-parent
home, speaking a language other than English at home,
significant family responsibilities assumed by the appli-
cant, and the general socioeconomic condition of the stu-
dent’s family. Seeking to address the decline in minority
enrollment after Hopwood, the University also expanded
its outreach programs.
   The Texas State Legislature also responded to the Hop­
wood decision. It enacted a measure known as the Top
Ten Percent Law, codified at Tex. Educ. Code Ann. §51.803
(West 2009). Also referred to as H. B. 588, the Top
Ten Percent Law grants automatic admission to any pub-
lic state college, including the University, to all students
in the top 10% of their class at high schools in Texas
that comply with certain standards.
   The University’s revised admissions process, coupled
with the operation of the Top Ten Percent Law, resulted in
a more racially diverse environment at the University.
Before the admissions program at issue in this case, in the
last year under the post-Hopwood AI/PAI system that did
not consider race, the entering class was 4.5% African-
American and 16.9% Hispanic. This is in contrast with
the 1996 pre-Hopwood and Top Ten Percent regime, when
race was explicitly considered, and the University’s enter-
ing freshman class was 4.1% African-American and 14.5%
Hispanic.
   Following this Court’s decisions in Grutter v. Bollinger,
supra, and Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244 (2003), the
University adopted a third admissions program, the 2004
program in which the University reverted to explicit con-
sideration of race. This is the program here at issue. In
Grutter, the Court upheld the use of race as one of many
“plus factors” in an admissions program that considered
the overall individual contribution of each candidate. In
Gratz, by contrast, the Court held unconstitutional Michi-
gan’s undergraduate admissions program, which automat-

                     Opinion of the Court

ically awarded points to applicants from certain racial
minorities.
   The University’s plan to resume race-conscious admis-
sions was given formal expression in June 2004 in an in-
ternal document entitled Proposal to Consider Race and
Ethnicity in Admissions (Proposal). Supp. App. 1a. The
Proposal relied in substantial part on a study of a subset
of undergraduate classes containing between 5 and 24
students. It showed that few of these classes had signifi-
cant enrollment by members of racial minorities. In addi-
tion the Proposal relied on what it called “anecdotal”
reports from students regarding their “interaction in the
classroom.” The Proposal concluded that the University
lacked a “critical mass” of minority students and that to
remedy the deficiency it was necessary to give explicit
consideration to race in the undergraduate admissions
program.
   To implement the Proposal the University included a
student’s race as a component of the PAI score, begin-
ning with applicants in the fall of 2004. The University
asks students to classify themselves from among five
predefined racial categories on the application. Race is not
assigned an explicit numerical value, but it is undisputed
that race is a meaningful factor.
   Once applications have been scored, they are plotted
on a grid with the Academic Index on the x-axis and the
Personal Achievement Index on the y-axis. On that grid
students are assigned to so-called cells based on their
individual scores. All students in the cells falling above a
certain line are admitted. All students below the line are
not. Each college—such as Liberal Arts or Engineering—
admits students separately. So a student is considered
initially for her first-choice college, then for her second
choice, and finally for general admission as an undeclared
major.
   Petitioner applied for admission to the University’s 2008

entering class and was rejected. She sued the University
and various University officials in the United States Dis-
trict Court for the Western District of Texas. She alleged
that the University’s consideration of race in admissions
violated the Equal Protection Clause. The parties cross-
moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted
summary judgment to the University. The United States
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. It held
that Grutter required courts to give substantial deference
to the University, both in the definition of the compelling
interest in diversity’s benefits and in deciding whether its
specific plan was narrowly tailored to achieve its stated
goal. Applying that standard, the court upheld the Uni-
versity’s admissions plan. 631 F.3d 213, 217–218 (2011).
   Over the dissent of seven judges, the Court of Appeals
denied petitioner’s request for rehearing en banc. See 644
F.3d 301, 303 (CA5 2011) (per curiam). Petitioner sought
a writ of certiorari. The writ was granted. 565 U. S. ___
(2012).
                              B
  Among the Court’s cases involving racial classifications
in education, there are three decisions that directly ad-
dress the question of considering racial minority status as
a positive or favorable factor in a university’s admissions
process, with the goal of achieving the educational benefits
of a more diverse student body: Bakke, 438 U.S. 265;
Gratz, supra; and Grutter, 539 U.S. 306. We take those
cases as given for purposes of deciding this case.
  We begin with the principal opinion authored by Justice
Powell in Bakke, supra. In Bakke, the Court considered
a system used by the medical school of the University of
California at Davis. From an entering class of 100 stu-
dents the school had set aside 16 seats for minority appli-
cants. In holding this program impermissible under the
Equal Protection Clause Justice Powell’s opinion stated
6        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN

                     Opinion of the Court

certain basic premises. First, “decisions based on race
or ethnic origin by faculties and administrations of state
universities are reviewable under the Fourteenth Amend-
ment.” Id., at 287 (separate opinion). The principle
of equal protection admits no “artificial line of a ‘two-
class theory’ ” that “permits the recognition of special
wards entitled to a degree of protection greater than that
accorded others.” Id., at 295. It is therefore irrelevant
that a system of racial preferences in admissions may
seem benign. Any racial classification must meet strict
scrutiny, for when government decisions “touch upon an
individual’s race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a
judicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear
on that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling
governmental interest.” Id., at 299.
   Next, Justice Powell identified one compelling interest
that could justify the consideration of race: the interest in
the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student
body. Redressing past discrimination could not serve as a
compelling interest, because a university’s “broad mission
[of] education” is incompatible with making the “judicial,
legislative, or administrative findings of constitutional or
statutory violations” necessary to justify remedial racial
classification. Id., at 307–309.
   The attainment of a diverse student body, by contrast,
serves values beyond race alone, including enhanced class-
room dialogue and the lessening of racial isolation and
stereotypes. The academic mission of a university is
“a special concern of the First Amendment.” Id., at 312.
Part of “ ‘the business of a university [is] to provide that
atmosphere which is most conducive to speculation, exper-
iment, and creation,’ ” and this in turn leads to the ques-
tion of “ ‘who may be admitted to study.’ ” Sweezy v. New
Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 263 (1957) (Frankfurter, J.,
concurring in judgment).
   Justice Powell’s central point, however, was that this
                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7

                     Opinion of the Court

interest in securing diversity’s benefits, although a per-
missible objective, is complex. “It is not an interest in
simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of
the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members
of selected ethnic groups, with the remaining percentage
an undifferentiated aggregation of students. The diversity
that furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a
far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of
which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though im-
portant element.” Bakke, 438 U.S., at 315 (separate
opinion).
   In Gratz, 539 U.S. 244, and Grutter, supra, the Court
endorsed the precepts stated by Justice Powell. In Grut­
ter, the Court reaffirmed his conclusion that obtaining the
educational benefits of “student body diversity is a compel-
ling state interest that can justify the use of race in uni-
versity admissions.” Id., at 325.
   As Gratz and Grutter observed, however, this follows
only if a clear precondition is met: The particular admis-
sions process used for this objective is subject to judicial
review. Race may not be considered unless the admissions
process can withstand strict scrutiny. “Nothing in Justice
Powell’s opinion in Bakke signaled that a university may
employ whatever means it desires to achieve the stated
goal of diversity without regard to the limits imposed by
our strict scrutiny analysis.” Gratz, supra, at 275. “To be
narrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program
cannot use a quota system,” Grutter, 539 U.S., at 334, but
instead must “remain flexible enough to ensure that each
applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way
that makes an applicant’s race or ethnicity the defining
feature of his or her application,” id., at 337. Strict scru-
tiny requires the university to demonstrate with clarity that
its “purpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible
and substantial, and that its use of the classification is
necessary . . . to the accomplishment of its purpose.”
8        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN

                      Opinion of the Court

Bakke, 438 U.S., at 305 (opinion of Powell, J.) (internal
quotation marks omitted).
   While these are the cases that most specifically address
the central issue in this case, additional guidance may
be found in the Court’s broader equal protection jurispru-
dence which applies in this context. “Distinctions between
citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very
nature odious to a free people,” Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S.
495, 517 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted), and
therefore “are contrary to our traditions and hence consti-
tutionally suspect,” Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499
(1954). “ ‘[B]ecause racial characteristics so seldom pro-
vide a relevant basis for disparate treatment,’ ” Richmond
v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 505 (1989) (quoting
Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 533–534 (1980)
(Stevens, J., dissenting)), “the Equal Protection Clause
demands that racial classifications . . . be subjected to the
‘most rigid scrutiny.’ ” Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 11
(1967).
   To implement these canons, judicial review must begin
from the position that “any official action that treats a
person differently on account of his race or ethnic origin is
inherently suspect.” Fullilove, supra, at 523 (Stewart, J.,
dissenting); McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184, 192
(1964). Strict scrutiny is a searching examination, and it
is the government that bears the burden to prove “ ‘that
the reasons for any [racial] classification [are] clearly iden-
tified and unquestionably legitimate,’ ” Croson, supra, at
505 (quoting Fullilove, 448 supra, at 533–535 (Stevens, J.,
dissenting)).
                             II
  Grutter made clear that racial “classifications are consti-
tutional only if they are narrowly tailored to further com-
pelling governmental interests.” 539 U.S., at 326. And
Grutter endorsed Justice Powell’s conclusion in Bakke that
                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9

                     Opinion of the Court

“the attainment of a diverse student body . . . is a consti-
tutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher
education.” 438 U. S., at 311–312 (separate opinion).
Thus, under Grutter, strict scrutiny must be applied
to any admissions program using racial categories or
classifications.
   According to Grutter, a university’s “educational judg-
ment that such diversity is essential to its educational
mission is one to which we defer.” 539 U.S., at 328.
Grutter concluded that the decision to pursue “the educa-
tional benefits that flow from student body diversity,” id.,
at 330, that the University deems integral to its mission
is, in substantial measure, an academic judgment to which
some, but not complete, judicial deference is proper under
Grutter. A court, of course, should ensure that there is a
reasoned, principled explanation for the academic deci-
sion. On this point, the District Court and Court of
Appeals were correct in finding that Grutter calls for de-
ference to the University’s conclusion, “ ‘based on its
experience and expertise,’ ” 631 F.3d, at 230 (quoting 645
F. Supp. 2d 587, 603 (WD Tex. 2009)), that a diverse stu-
dent body would serve its educational goals. There is
disagreement about whether Grutter was consistent with
the principles of equal protection in approving this compel-
ling interest in diversity. See post, at 1 (SCALIA, J., con-
curring); post, at 4–5 (THOMAS, J., concurring); post, at 1–2
(GINSBURG, J., dissenting). But the parties here do not
ask the Court to revisit that aspect of Grutter’s holding.
   A university is not permitted to define diversity as
“some specified percentage of a particular group merely
because of its race or ethnic origin.” Bakke, supra, at
307 (opinion of Powell, J.). “That would amount to out-
right racial balancing, which is patently unconstitutional.”
Grutter, supra, at 330. “Racial balancing is not trans-
formed from ‘patently unconstitutional’ to a compelling
state interest simply by relabeling it ‘racial diversity.’ ”
10       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN

                      Opinion of the Court

Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School
Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 732 (2007).
  Once the University has established that its goal of di-
versity is consistent with strict scrutiny, however, there
must still be a further judicial determination that the
admissions process meets strict scrutiny in its implemen-
tation. The University must prove that the means chosen
by the University to attain diversity are narrowly tailored
to that goal. On this point, the University receives no
deference. Grutter made clear that it is for the courts, not
for university administrators, to ensure that “[t]he means
chosen to accomplish the [government’s] asserted purpose
must be specifically and narrowly framed to accomplish
that purpose.” 539 U.S., at 333 (internal quotation marks
omitted). True, a court can take account of a university’s
experience and expertise in adopting or rejecting certain
admissions processes. But, as the Court said in Grutter, it
remains at all times the University’s obligation to demon-
strate, and the Judiciary’s obligation to determine, that
admissions processes “ensure that each applicant is evalu-
ated as an individual and not in a way that makes an
applicant’s race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or
her application.” Id., at 337.
  Narrow tailoring also requires that the reviewing court
verify that it is “necessary” for a university to use race
to achieve the educational benefits of diversity. Bakke,
supra, at 305. This involves a careful judicial inquiry into
whether a university could achieve sufficient diversity
without using racial classifications. Although “[n]arrow
tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable
race-neutral alternative,” strict scrutiny does require a
court to examine with care, and not defer to, a university’s
“serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral
alternatives.” See Grutter, 539 U. S., at 339–340 (empha-
sis added). Consideration by the university is of course
necessary, but it is not sufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny:
                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11

                     Opinion of the Court

The reviewing court must ultimately be satisfied that no
workable race-neutral alternatives would produce the edu-
cational benefits of diversity. If “ ‘a nonracial approach
 . . . could promote the substantial interest about as well
and at tolerable administrative expense,’ ” Wygant v.
Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U.S. 267, 280, n. 6 (1986) (quoting
Greenawalt, Judicial Scrutiny of “Benign” Racial Prefer-
ence in Law School Admissions, 75 Colum. L. Rev. 559,
578–579 (1975)), then the university may not consider
race. A plaintiff, of course, bears the burden of placing the
validity of a university’s adoption of an affirmative action
plan in issue. But strict scrutiny imposes on the univer-
sity the ultimate burden of demonstrating, before turning to
racial classifications, that available, workable race-neutral
alternatives do not suffice.
    Rather than perform this searching examination, how-
ever, the Court of Appeals held petitioner could challenge
only “whether [the University’s] decision to reintroduce
race as a factor in admissions was made in good faith.”
631 F.3d, at 236. And in considering such a challenge,
the court would “presume the University acted in good
faith” and place on petitioner the burden of rebutting that
presumption. Id., at 231–232. The Court of Appeals
held that to “second-guess the merits” of this aspect of
the University’s decision was a task it was “ill-equipped to
perform” and that it would attempt only to “ensure that
[the University’s] decision to adopt a race-conscious ad-
missions policy followed from [a process of] good faith
consideration.” Id., at 231. The Court of Appeals thus
concluded that “the narrow-tailoring inquiry—like the
compelling-interest inquiry—is undertaken with a degree
of deference to the Universit[y].” Id., at 232. Because “the
efforts of the University have been studied, serious, and of
high purpose,” the Court of Appeals held that the use of
race in the admissions program fell within “a constitution-
ally protected zone of discretion.” Id., at 231.
12       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN

                      Opinion of the Court

    These expressions of the controlling standard are at
odds with Grutter’s command that “all racial classifica-
tions imposed by government ‘must be analyzed by a
reviewing court under strict scrutiny.’ ” 539 U.S., at 326
(quoting Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U.S.
200, 227 (1995)). In Grutter, the Court approved the plan
at issue upon concluding that it was not a quota, was
sufficiently flexible, was limited in time, and followed
“serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral
alternatives.” 539 U.S., at 339. As noted above, see
supra, at 1, the parties do not challenge, and the Court
therefore does not consider, the correctness of that
determination.
    Grutter did not hold that good faith would forgive an
impermissible consideration of race. It must be remem-
bered that “the mere recitation of a ‘benign’ or legitimate
purpose for a racial classification is entitled to little or no
weight.” Croson, 488 U.S., at 500. Strict scrutiny does
not permit a court to accept a school’s assertion that its
admissions process uses race in a permissible way without
a court giving close analysis to the evidence of how the
process works in practice.
    The higher education dynamic does not change the
narrow tailoring analysis of strict scrutiny applicable in
other contexts. “[T]he analysis and level of scrutiny ap-
plied to determine the validity of [a racial] classification do
not vary simply because the objective appears acceptable
. . . . While the validity and importance of the objective
may affect the outcome of the analysis, the analysis itself
does not change.” Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan,
458 U.S. 718, 724, n. 9 (1982).
    The District Court and Court of Appeals confined the
strict scrutiny inquiry in too narrow a way by deferring
to the University’s good faith in its use of racial classifica-
tions and affirming the grant of summary judgment on
that basis. The Court vacates that judgment, but fairness
                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            13

                      Opinion of the Court

to the litigants and the courts that heard the case requires
that it be remanded so that the admissions process can
be considered and judged under a correct analysis. See
Adarand, supra, at 237. Unlike Grutter, which was decided
after trial, this case arises from cross-motions for sum-
mary judgment. In this case, as in similar cases, in de-
termining whether summary judgment in favor of the
University would be appropriate, the Court of Appeals
must assess whether the University has offered sufficient
evidence that would prove that its admissions program is
narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of
diversity. Whether this record—and not “simple . . . as-
surances of good intention,” Croson, supra, at 500—is
sufficient is a question for the Court of Appeals in the first
instance.
                          *     *    *
  Strict scrutiny must not be “ ‘strict in theory, but fatal in
fact,’ ” Adarand, supra, at 237; see also Grutter, supra, at
326. But the opposite is also true. Strict scrutiny must
not be strict in theory but feeble in fact. In order for judi-
cial review to be meaningful, a university must make a
showing that its plan is narrowly tailored to achieve the
only interest that this Court has approved in this context:
the benefits of a student body diversity that “encompasses
a . . . broa[d] array of qualifications and characteristics of
which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though im-
portant element.” Bakke, 438 U.S., at 315 (opinion of
Powell, J.). The judgment of the Court of Appeals is va-
cated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
                                              It is so ordered.

F. Supp. 2d 587, 609 (WD Tex. 2009) (“[T]he parties agree
[that the University’s] policy was based on the [admis-
sions] policy [upheld in Grutter].”).
   Petitioner urges that Texas’ Top Ten Percent Law and
race-blind holistic review of each application achieve
significant diversity, so the University must be content
with those alternatives. I have said before and reiterate
here that only an ostrich could regard the supposedly
neutral alternatives as race unconscious. See Gratz, 539
U. S., at 303–304, n. 10 (dissenting opinion). As Justice
Souter observed, the vaunted alternatives suffer from “the
disadvantage of deliberate obfuscation.” Id., at 297–298
(dissenting opinion).
   Texas’ percentage plan was adopted with racially segre-
gated neighborhoods and schools front and center stage.
See House Research Organization, Bill Analysis, HB 588,
pp. 4–5 (Apr. 15, 1997) (“Many regions of the state, school
districts, and high schools in Texas are still predominantly
composed of people from a single racial or ethnic group.
Because of the persistence of this segregation, admitting
the top 10 percent of all high schools would provide a
diverse population and ensure that a large, well qualified
pool of minority students was admitted to Texas universi-
ties.”). It is race consciousness, not blindness to race, that
drives such plans.2 As for holistic review, if universities
cannot explicitly include race as a factor, many may “re-
sort to camouflage” to “maintain their minority enroll-
ment.” Gratz, 539 U.S., at 304 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting).

    2 The
        notion that Texas’ Top Ten Percent Law is race neutral calls to
mind Professor Thomas Reed Powell’s famous statement: “If you think
that you can think about a thing inextricably attached to something
else without thinking of the thing which it is attached to, then you have
a legal mind.” T. Arnold, The Symbols of Government 101 (1935)
(internal quotation marks omitted). Only that kind of legal mind could
conclude that an admissions plan specifically designed to produce racial
diversity is not race conscious.

   I have several times explained why government actors,
including state universities, need not be blind to the lin-
gering effects of “an overtly discriminatory past,” the
legacy of “centuries of law-sanctioned inequality.” Id., at
298 (dissenting opinion). See also Adarand Constructors,
Inc. v. Peña, 515 U.S. 200, 272–274 (1995) (dissenting
opinion). Among constitutionally permissible options, I
remain convinced, “those that candidly disclose their
consideration of race [are] preferable to those that conceal
it.” Gratz, 539 U.S., at 305, n. 11 (dissenting opinion).
   Accordingly, I would not return this case for a second
look. As the thorough opinions below show, 631 F.3d 213
(CA5 2011); 645 F. Supp. 2d 587, the University’s admis-
sions policy flexibly considers race only as a “factor of a
factor of a factor of a factor” in the calculus, id., at 608;
followed a yearlong review through which the University
reached the reasonable, good-faith judgment that suppos-
edly race-neutral initiatives were insufficient to achieve,
in appropriate measure, the educational benefits of student-
body diversity, see 631 F. 3d, at 225–226; and is sub-
ject to periodic review to ensure that the consideration of
race remains necessary and proper to achieve the Uni-
versity’s educational objectives, see id., at 226.3 Justice
Powell’s opinion in Bakke and the Court’s decision in
Grutter require no further determinations. See Grutter,

  3 As the Court said in Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 339 (2003),

“[n]arrow tailoring . . . require[s] serious, good faith consideration of
workable race-neutral alternatives that will achieve the diversity the
university seeks.” But, Grutter also explained, it does not “require a
university to choose between maintaining a reputation for excellence
[and] fulfilling a commitment to provide educational opportunities
to members of all racial groups.” Ibid. I do not read the Court to
say otherwise. See ante, at 10 (acknowledging that, in determining
whether a race-conscious admissions policy satisfies Grutter’s narrow-
tailoring requirement, “a court can take account of a university’s
experience and expertise in adopting or rejecting certain admissions
processes”).

                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting

539 U. S., at 333–343; Bakke, 438 U.S., at 315–320.
   The Court rightly declines to cast off the equal protec-
tion framework settled in Grutter. See ante, at 5. Yet it
stops short of reaching the conclusion that framework
warrants. Instead, the Court vacates the Court of Ap-
peals’ judgment and remands for the Court of Appeals to
“assess whether the University has offered sufficient
evidence [to] prove that its admissions program is narrowly
tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.”
Ante, at 13. As I see it, the Court of Appeals has already
completed that inquiry, and its judgment, trained on this
Court’s Bakke and Grutter pathmarkers, merits our
approbation.4
                      *     *    *
  For the reasons stated, I would affirm the judgment of
the Court of Appeals.




——————
   4 Because the University’s admissions policy, in my view, is constitu-

tional under Grutter, there is no need for the Court in this case “to
revisit whether all governmental classifications by race, whether
designed to benefit or to burden a historically disadvantaged group,
should be subject to the same standard of judicial review.” 539 U.S., at
346, n. (GINSBURG, J., concurring). See also Gratz v. Bollinger, 539
U.S. 244, 301 (2003) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (“Actions designed to
burden groups long denied full citizenship stature are not sensibly
ranked with measures taken to hasten the day when entrenched
discrimination and its aftereffects have been extirpated.”)"
15711,Justice Thomas,dissenting,False,Green v. Brennan,,2016,2.0,"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits em­
ployers from engaging in discriminatory acts against their
employees. Under a 1992 Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) regulation implementing Title VII,
federal employees “who believe they have been discrimi­
nated against” “must consult a[n] [EEOC] Counselor prior
to filing a complaint in order to try to informally resolve
the matter.” 29 CFR §1614.105(a) (2015). In particular,
the aggrieved employee “must initiate contact with a
Counselor within 45 days of date of the matter alleged to
be discriminatory.” §1614.105(a)(1).
  Today, the majority holds that a “matter alleged to be
discriminatory” includes a matter that is not “discrimina­
tory” at all: a federal employee’s decision to quit his job.
Ante, at 5–6. The majority reaches this conclusion by
adopting an atextual reading of the regulation that ex­
pands the constructive-discharge doctrine. Consistent with
the text of the regulation and history of the constructive-
discharge doctrine, I would hold that only an employ­
er’s actions may constitute a “matter alleged to be discrim­
inatory.” Because the only employer action alleged to be
discriminatory here took place more than 45 days before
petitioner Marvin Green contacted EEOC, his claims are
untimely. I therefore respectfully dissent.

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

                              I
  The meaning of a “matter alleged to be discriminatory”
refers to actions taken by the employer, not the employee.
This follows from the ordinary meaning of “matter” and
“discriminatory,” as well as this Court’s precedents.
                              A
   I begin with “ ‘the language [of the regulation] itself and
the specific context in which that language is used.’ ”
McNeill v. United States, 563 U.S. 816, 819 (2011) (brack­
ets omitted). When a word or phrase is left undefined—as
“matter alleged to be discriminatory” is—we consider its
“ordinary meaning.” Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513
U.S. 179, 187 (1995). A “matter” is “a subject under
consideration, esp. involving a dispute or litigation” or
“[s]omething that is to be tried or proved; an allegation
forming the basis of a claim or defense.” Black’s Law
Dictionary 992 (7th ed. 1999); The Oxford English Dic­
tionary 481 (2d ed. 1989) (“matter” means “[a]n event,
circumstance, fact, question, state or course of things, etc.,
which is or may be an object of consideration or practical
concern; a subject, an affair, a business”); see ante, at 5
(embracing this view). The term “discriminatory” means
characterized by differential treatment that lacks a sound
justification. See The Random House Dictionary of the
English Language 564 (2d ed. 1987) (“discriminatory”
means “characterized by or showing prejudicial treatment
esp. as an indication of racial, religious, or sexual bias”);
B. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 191 (1987)
(“discriminatory” means “applying discrimination in
treatment, esp. on ethnic grounds”); Black’s Law Diction­
ary 479 (“discrimination” means characterized by
“[d]ifferential treatment; esp., a failure to treat all persons
equally when no reasonable distinction can be found be­
tween those favored and those not favored”). Thus, a
“matter alleged to be discriminatory” means an employee’s

allegation that he was treated in an unjustifiably differen­
tial manner.
   In the context of employment discrimination, only an
employer can discriminate against—or apply unjustifiable
differential treatment to—an employee.1 An employee
cannot plausibly be said to discriminate against himself.
It therefore makes no sense to say that an employee’s act
of quitting constitutes an action in which he was treated
in a differential manner that lacked a sound justification.
   And, it does not make any more sense to say that an
employee’s decision to quit is itself “discriminatory” simply
because it may result from antecedent discriminatory
conduct. As two of our precedents—National Railroad
Passenger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101 (2002),
and Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250
(1980)—illustrate, the “matter alleged to be discrimina-
tory” is the reason the employee quit, and not the quitting
itself.
   In Morgan, we rejected the argument that a phrase
similar to “matter alleged to be discriminatory”—namely,
an “alleged unlawful employment practice”—“connotes an
ongoing violation that can endure or recur over a period of
time.” 536 U.S., at 109–111. We held that discrete dis­
criminatory acts of the employer occurring outside a filing
period were not actionable, even if connected to other acts
within the period. Id., at 113. The word “practice,” we
explained, did not “conver[t] related discrete acts into a
single unlawful practice for the purposes of timely filing.”
Id., at 111. The same is true of the word “matter.” See,
e.g., EEOC Compliance Manual: Threshold Issues §2–
IV(C)(1), n. 179 (equating “matter alleged to be discrimi­
natory” with “the alleged discriminatory employment

threshold.html (as last visited Mar. 29, 2016) (equating
“matter alleged to be discriminatory” with “the alleged
discriminatory employment practice”).
    Ricks complements Morgan by holding that discrimina­
tion occurs when an employer takes some adverse action
against the employee, and not when the employee feels the
consequences of that action. 449 U.S., at 257–258. In
Ricks, we considered the timeliness of an EEOC complaint
that a professor filed after he was allegedly denied tenure
on account of his national origin. Id., at 252–254. The
employer offered him a contract to teach one more year
after it denied tenure. Id., at 255. The professor contended
that his claim did not accrue until his 1-year contract
expired, because the offer of the contract constituted a
“ ‘continuing violation.’ ” Id., at 257. We rejected that
argument and explained that “[m]ere continuity of em­
ployment, without more, is insufficient to prolong the life
of a cause of action for employment discrimination.” Ibid.;
see also Chardon v. Fernandez, 454 U.S. 6, 8 (1981) (per
curiam) (holding that claims of administrators of the
Puerto Rican Department of Education were untimely
because their claims accrued when they received notice
that they would be fired and not on the effective date of
their terminations).
    The alleged employer conduct that most immediately
prompted Green’s decision to quit was the Postal Service’s
request on or about December 15, 2009, that he sign a
settlement agreement. See App. 17, ¶72; App. 19, ¶83. It
is irrelevant whether Green’s decision to quit “g[a]v[e]
present effect to the past illegal act[s] and therefore per­
petuate[d] the consequences of forbidden discrimination.”

“matter alleged to be discriminatory,” Green had 45 days
from December 15 to initiate contact with EEOC.2
Because he was 52 days late in doing so, his claim was
untimely.
                              B
   The majority reaches the opposite conclusion for three
reasons. None withstands scrutiny.
   First, the majority observes that the text of the regula­
tion is “not particularly helpful” because the word “matter”
simply means “ ‘an allegation forming the basis of a claim or
defense,’ ” which “could readily apply to a discrimination-
precipitated resignation.” Ante, at 5. Thus, the ma-
jority contends, “matter” could “reasonably be interpreted
to include the factual basis for a claim,” which, in its view,
includes Green’s decision to resign. Ante, at 10. But, as
explained, that interpretation does not grapple with the
entire phrase, “matter alleged to be discriminatory,” which
does not encompass the subsequent nondiscriminatory
actions that the employee takes.
   Second, the majority contends that the “standard rule
for limitations periods” informs its understanding of 29
CFR §1614.105. Ante, at 6 (internal quotation marks
omitted). Under this rule, the majority contends, a limita­
tions period does not begin to run until there is a “com­
plete and present cause of action.” Ante, at 6 (internal
quotation marks omitted). The majority concludes that

——————
  2 Title VII does not provide federal employees with a cause of action

for retaliation. Ante, at 3, n. 1. Title VII’s federal-sector provision
incorporates certain private-sector provisions related to discrimination
but does not incorporate the provision prohibiting retaliation in the
private sector. See 42 U.S. C. §2000e–16(d) (incorporating §§2000e–
5(f ) to (k) but not §2000e–3(a), which forbids private-sector retaliation).
In light of this text, I have grave doubts that Green—as a federal
employee—has a claim for retaliation. But because the parties do not
raise this issue, and the majority leaves it open, I need not resolve it.
6                    GREEN v. BRENNAN

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

there is no “complete and present cause of action” for
constructive discharge until “an employee resigns.” Ibid.
(internal quotation marks omitted).
   Even assuming that an employee’s resignation was an
essential part of a constructive discharge “claim” (but see
Part II, infra) the “standard rule” is merely a “default”
rule. Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v.
United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U.S. 409, 418 (2005).
That “default rule” does not apply, however, where—as
here—the text confirms that the limitations period begins
to run before the cause of action accrues.
   Pillsbury v. United Engineering Co., 342 U.S. 197
(1952), confirms this point. In that case, the Court consid­
ered a statute that provided that “ ‘[t]he right to compen­
sation for disability . . . shall be barred unless a claim
therefor is filed within one year after the injury.’ ” Id., at
197 (quoting 33 U.S. C. §913(a) (1952)). The Court held
that the 1-year period began at the time of injury, not
when the employee later became disabled as a result of the
injury and concluded that “Congress meant what it said
when it limited recovery to one year from date of injury,
and ‘injury’ does not mean ‘disability.’ ” 342 U.S., at 199–
200. Although that reading meant that “an employee
[could] be barred from filing his claim before his right to
file it arises,” the Court refused to “rewrite the statute of
limitations” to avoid that result. Ibid.; see also, e.g., Dodd
v. United States, 545 U.S. 353, 357–360 (2005) (giving
effect to the clear text of a limitations provision even
though that reading “ma[de] it difficult” for certain mo­
vants “to obtain relief” and could lead to “harsh results”).
   Like the limitations provision in Pillsbury, 29 CFR
§1614.105 makes clear that the limitations period could
begin before any constructive-discharge claim accrues, lest
“what was intended to be a limitation [be] no limitation at
all.” 342 U.S., at 200. The regulation instructs that the
limitations period begins to run when the “matter alleged
                 Cite as: 578 U. S. ____ (2016)           7

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

to be discriminatory” occurs—i.e., the discriminatory
conduct of the employer. To say that this includes Green’s
resignation could “have the effect of extending the limita­
tion indefinitely.” Ibid.; see Part I–A, supra.
   Finally, the majority downplays Morgan and Ricks by
claiming that Green’s resignation was “not merely an
inevitable consequence of the discrimination he suffered; it
is an essential part of his constructive-discharge claim.”
Ante, at 13. “[A] claim that an employer constructively
discharged an employee,” the majority contends, “is no
different from a claim that an employer actually dis­
charged an employee.” Ante, at 7. This reasoning cannot
be reconciled with the regulatory text and fails to grapple
with our precedents. By isolating Green’s late response to
the settlement agreement rather than his employer’s
alleged coercion of Green to sign that agreement, the
majority ignores the discriminatory act and bestows on
Green an advantage that other employees subject to
wrongful discrimination do not have. Had Green signed
termination papers rather than settlement papers, there
would be no question about the untimeliness of his claims.
As in Ricks, the time for Green’s claim would have begun
to run when his employer discriminated against him, even
if the termination was not effective until months later.
449 U.S., at 257; see also Chardon, 454 U.S., at 8 (same).
But today, the majority decides that Green’s claim is
different. In doing so, the majority elevates constructive
discharge to the status of a super termination capable of
extending a limitations period far beyond the time the
employer acted discriminatorily.
                           II
  The majority’s error is not merely one of regulatory
misinterpretation. By misreading the regulation, the
majority expands the constructive-discharge doctrine
beyond its original bounds. In particular, the majority
8                    GREEN v. BRENNAN

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

cements the (mistaken) notion that constructive discharge
is an independent cause of action—and not a mere coun­
terdefense—by unjustifiably focusing on an employee’s
response to an employer’s conduct. See, e.g., ante, at 6–14.
In doing so, the majority exacerbates the problems that
Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U.S. 129 (2004),
first created in adopting a capacious definition of “con­
structive discharge.”
                              A
   In holding that a discrimination claim based on con­
structive discharge accrues when an employee resigns, the
majority wrongly assumes that constructive discharge is a
separate claim equivalent to an actual discharge under
Title VII. Ante, at 10–11. But the constructive-discharge
doctrine is best understood as “a counter-defense to the
employer[’]s defense that the worker [voluntarily] quit,”
and not a separate claim. EEOC v. R. J. Gallagher Co.,
959 F. Supp. 405, 408 (SD Tex. 1997), vacated in part on
other grounds, 181 F.3d 645 (CA5 1999).
   The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) developed
the constructive-discharge doctrine in the 1930’s “to ad­
dress situations in which employers coerced employees to
resign, often by creating intolerable working conditions, in
retaliation for employees’ engagement in collective activi­
ties.” Suders, supra, at 141; see also Shuck, Comment,
That’s It, I Quit: Returning to First Principles in Con­
structive Discharge Doctrine, 23 Berkeley J. Empl. & Lab.
L. 401, 406–407 (2002). An employee who voluntarily quit
usually lost the right to backpay and other remedies,
whereas an employee who was fired for discriminatory
reasons did not. See id., at 403. The constructive-
discharge doctrine enabled courts to provide a remedy to
those employees who voluntarily quit based on the fiction
that their decision to quit was not actually voluntary. See
ibid.; Suders, supra, at 147, n. 8. Thus, as it was originally
                 Cite as: 578 U. S. ____ (2016)            9

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

conceived, constructive discharge was not an independ-
ent cause of action but instead a counterdefense to an
employer’s contention that a resignation was voluntary,
and thus, should “factor into the damages.” Knabe v.
Boury Corp., 114 F.3d 407, 408, n. 1 (CA3 1997); see also
Russ v. Van Scoyoc Assoc., Inc., 122 F. Supp. 2d 29, 35–36
(DC 2000) (collecting cases). So understood, an employee’s
resignation does not complete any cause of action, and
thus does not trigger the limitations period.
  The majority contends that Suders marked a departure
from this original conception of constructive discharge by
“expressly h[o]ld[ing] that constructive discharge is a
claim distinct from the underlying discriminatory act.”
Ante, at 11. But, that case does not resolve the issue one
way or the other. To be sure, Suders contains a few
statements suggesting that constructive discharge is a
claim. As the majority points out, for example, Suders
states that a hostile work environment claim is less
“grav[e]” than a “claim of hostile-environment constructive
discharge,” and “a claim for constructive discharge lies
under Title VII.” Ante, at 11 (citing Suders, 542 U.S., at
142, 149; emphasis added); see also id., at 133 (referring to
“sexual harassment/constructive discharge claim”); id., at
143 (referring to “constructive discharge claims”). At the
same time, however, the question at issue in Suders was
the availability of affirmative defenses. In that vein,
Suders held only that employers could avail themselves of
those defenses if an “official act” of the company “d[id] not
underlie the constructive discharge.” Id., at 148. There
are also statements throughout the Suders opinion that
are flatly inconsistent with the reading that the majority
suggests. For example, it points out that an employee’s
resignation is “assimilated to a formal discharge” for
“remedial purposes,” without mentioning liability. Id., at
141 (emphasis added); see also id., at 147, n. 8 (noting that
“a prevailing constructive discharge plaintiff is entitled to
10                  GREEN v. BRENNAN

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

all damages available for formal discharge,” including
“backpay” and sometimes “frontpay”); id., at 148 (“a con­
structive discharge is functionally the same as an actual
termination in damages-enhancing respects” (emphasis
added)). In short, Suders does not resolve whether con­
structive discharge depends on the underlying discrimina­
tory act. And, it does not hold that constructive discharge
is a cause of action that is distinct from the underlying
discrimination claim.
                             B
   The majority today not only exploits Suders’ imprecision
about whether constructive discharge is an independent
claim, but also takes advantage of that opinion’s ambig-
uity as to what an employee must establish to invoke the
doctrine. In Suders, I objected to the Court’s statement
that the constructive-discharge doctrine encompasses
those situations in which “working conditions become so
intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee’s
position would have felt compelled to resign.” Id., at 141.
That description does “not in the least resemble actual
discharge” because it permits an employee “to allege a
constructive discharge absent any adverse employment
action” and absent any employer intent to cause a resigna­
tion. Id., at 153–154 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).
   Despite the Suders Court’s overly broad description of
the doctrine, the Court at least retained some focus on an
employer’s conduct. The Court in Suders explained that
whether to “assimilat[e]” a constructive discharge “to a
formal discharge for remedial purposes” entailed an “ob­
jective” inquiry that focused on the “working conditions”
themselves. Id., at 141. And, it held that an employer
could raise certain affirmative defenses to stave off liabil­
ity when no official action forced an employee to resign.
Id., at 147.
   Today, the majority goes even further than Suders in
                 Cite as: 578 U. S. ____ (2016)          11

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

eviscerating the limitations on the constructive-discharge
doctrine. The majority’s rule transforms constructive
discharge into a claim focused on the employee’s conduct,
instead of the employer’s. Green does not allege that,
after he signed the settlement agreement, any other act—
by a supervisor or even a co-worker—occurred or other­
wise immediately precipitated his decision to quit. See
App. 19, ¶¶83–85. The majority’s holding—that Green’s
claim accrued when he resigned—must rest then on
Green’s own subjective feelings about the forced settle­
ment. By ignoring the date on which an employer’s dis­
criminatory act occurred and instead focusing only on an
employee’s subjective response to that discriminatory act
(see ante, at 12–14), the majority dispenses with the func­
tion of an employer’s conduct. The effect of the majority’s
analysis, then, is that constructive discharge no longer
involves any sort of objective inquiry.
   I cannot agree. The concept of constructive discharge is
already on tenuous footing. It is not based on the text of
Title VII but instead on the fiction that an employee’s
resignation can be attributed to his employer in limited
circumstances. As initially conceived by the NLRB, this
fictitious attribution could be justified if an employer’s
unlawful employment practice “standing alone, render[ed]
an employee’s resignation reasonable and [thus] entitle[d]
the employee to backpay.” Shuck, 23 Berkeley J. Empl. &
Lab. L., at 409 (emphasis added); see, e.g., In re Waples-
Platter Co., 49 N. L. R. B. 1156, 1174–1175 (1943) (con­
cluding that it was reasonable per se for the employees to
quit in light of the nature of the employer’s intentional,
discriminatory transfers). Such attribution cannot be
justified, however, where—as here—the constructive
discharge accrues based solely on an employee’s subjective
response to alleged discrimination.

12                GREEN v. BRENNAN

                  THOMAS, J., dissenting

  Because Green has not proffered any evidence that
discrimination continued to occur after he signed the
settlement agreement, his contact with EEOC was un­
timely under 29 CFR §1614.105. Accordingly, I would
affirm the judgment of the Court of the Appeals"
15710,Justice Alito,concurring,False,Green v. Brennan,,2016,2.0,"In its pursuit of a bright-line limitations rule for con-
structive discharge claims, the Court loses sight of a bed-
rock principle of our Title VII cases: An act done with
discriminatory intent must have occurred within the
limitations period. We have repeatedly held that the time
to pursue an employment discrimination claim starts
running when a discriminatory act occurs, and that a
fresh limitations period does not start upon the occurrence
of a later nondiscriminatory act—even if that later act
carries forward the effects of the earlier discrimination.
See, e.g., United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553,
558 (1977); Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250,
257–258 (1980); Chardon v. Fernandez, 454 U.S. 6, 8
(1981) ( per curiam); Lorance v. AT&T Technologies, Inc.,
490 U.S. 900, 907–908, 911 (1989); National Railroad
Passenger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 113
(2002); Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U.S.
618, 628 (2007). Without mentioning this consistent line
of precedent, the Court categorically declares that the
limitations period for constructive discharge cases starts
upon the employee’s resignation, no matter when the last
discriminatory act occurred. This effectively disposes of
the discriminatory-intent requirement.
  Rather than jettison our precedent, I would hold that
2                    GREEN v. BRENNAN

                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

the limitations period for constructive discharge claims—
like all other employment discrimination claims—starts
running upon a discriminatory act of the employer. But I
would also hold that an employee’s resignation can, in
many cases, be considered a discriminatory act of the
employer. This is so where an employer subjects an em-
ployee to intolerable working conditions with the discrimi-
natory intent to force the employee to resign. In these
circumstances, the employee’s consequent resignation is
tantamount to an intentional termination by the em-
ployer, and so gives rise to a fresh limitations period just
as a conventional termination would. Absent such intent,
however, the resignation is not an independent discrimi-
natory act but merely a delayed consequence of earlier
discrimination. The resignation may be a basis for en-
hancing damages in a claim brought on the underlying
discrimination, but it cannot restart the limitations clock.
   In this case, Green presented sufficient evidence that
the Postal Service intended to force him to resign when it
presented him with a settlement agreement requiring that
he either retire or transfer to a distant post office for much
less pay. Accordingly, the 45-day window for him to initi-
ate counseling opened when he gave the Postal Service
notice of his resignation.

  The regulation at issue here requires a federal employee
who complains of unlawful discrimination to initiate con-
tact with an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) coun-
selor “within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to
be discriminatory.” 29 CFR §1614.105(a)(1) (2015). The
Court observes that this language “is not particularly
helpful” in resolving the question presented, and so it
quickly moves on to other considerations. Ante, at 5. I
think that more can be discerned from the regulation’s

text. The Court observes that a “matter” in this context is
“an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense.”
Black’s Law Dictionary 1126 (10th ed. 2014); ante, at 5.
But the Court fails to plug in the regulation’s critical
qualifier: The matter must be (alleged to be) discrimina-
tory. The phrase “matter alleged to be discriminatory” is
thus most fairly read to refer to the allegation of discrimi-
nation that underlies an employee’s claim, not just any
fact that supports the claim.
  Even if the regulation’s text were unclear on this point,
the next place I would look is not to a “standard rule”
governing limitations periods, as the majority does, ibid.,
but to the specific limitations rules we apply in other Title
VII cases. Private-sector Title VII plaintiffs are required
to file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) within 180 or 300 days “after the
alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.”            42
U.S. C. §2000e–5(e)(1); see Morgan, supra (construing
this statutory provision).1 Although this language is not
identical to the regulation at issue here, nothing in either
text requires that they be read as setting different rules.
Indeed, the EEOC’s Compliance Manual treats them the
same—it describes the regulation as requiring federal
employees to contact a counselor within 45 days of “the
alleged discriminatory employment practice,” and it cites
Morgan as providing the governing standard.2 We also
granted review in this case on the premise that the same

   1 This 180- or 300-day period is often referred to as the “charging” or

“filing” period. See, e.g., Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550
U.S. 618, 624 (2007); National Railroad Passenger Corporation v.
Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 117 (2002). Because the 45-day period at issue
in this case involves initiating counseling rather than filing a charge,
for simplicity I refer to all of these periods as “limitations” periods.

rule would apply to both federal-sector and private-sector
Title VII cases: Green’s petition and merits brief ask us to
decide when the filing period for constructive discharge
claims begins as a matter of “federal employment discrim-
ination law” generally, Pet. for Cert. i; Brief for Peti-
tioner i, and the Circuit split he alleges consists primarily of
cases in which the limitations period ran from the date of
an unlawful employment “practice,” see Pet. for Cert. 11–
16. The majority, for its part, seems to agree that the
same rules should apply in the federal and private sectors,
and it too relies on private-sector cases in describing the
Circuit split that today’s decision is meant to “resolve.”
Ante, at 4–5, and nn. 2–4. The majority’s relegation of our
Title VII timeliness cases to its rebuttal argument, see
ante, at 12–14, is thus surprising.
                               B
   Our Title VII precedents set somewhat different limita-
tions rules for claims based on a discrete act of discrimina-
tion (such as termination, failure to hire, or demotion) and
claims based on a hostile work environment. I will focus
on the former set of rules because Green’s resignation was
a discrete act that was precipitated by another discrete
act—namely, the settlement agreement that required him
to retire or transfer to a far-off, lower paying position. For
private-sector claims based on discrete acts, the limita-
tions period starts to run on the day the discriminatory act
occurred and expires 180 or 300 days later. Morgan, 536
U.S., at 110. This means that an act done with discrimi-
natory intent—not merely some act bearing on the claim—
must have occurred within the limitations period. We
therefore held in Morgan that “discrete discriminatory
acts are not actionable if time barred, even when they are
related to acts alleged in timely filed charges,” and that “a
time-barred act [cannot] justify filing a charge concerning
a termination that was not independently discriminatory.”

Id., at 113 (emphasis added).
   We spoke even more directly to the point in Ledbetter.
There we described “discriminatory intent” as the “defin-
ing element” of a Title VII disparate-treatment claim, 550
U.S., at 624, and held that the plaintiff ’s claim of pay
discrimination was untimely because she did not allege
that any “intentionally discriminatory conduct occurred
during the [limitations] period,” id., at 628. Although the
plaintiff had suffered lower pay within the limitations
period because of earlier alleged discrimination, we ex-
plained that under our precedents a new limitations pe-
riod “does not commenc[e] upon the occurrence of subse-
quent nondiscriminatory acts that entail adverse effects
resulting from the past discrimination.” Ibid. (discussing
Evans, 431 U.S. 553, Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, Lorance, 490
U.S. 900, and Morgan, supra). Relying on nondiscrimina-
tory acts to establish a timely claim, we reasoned, would
impermissibly “shift intent from one act (the act that
consummates the discriminatory employment practice) to
a later act that was not performed with bias or discrimina-
tory motive. The effect of this shift would be to impose
liability in the absence of the requisite intent.” 550 U.S.,
at 629. At the same time, we recognized that when multi-
ple acts that are each “intentionally discriminatory” occur,
“a fresh violation takes place”—and thus a new limitations
period starts running—“when each act is committed.” Id.,
at 628.3

  3 Congress has since abrogated Ledbetter’s precise holding in the con-

text of “discrimination in compensation,” Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act
of 2009, §3, 123 Stat. 5, codified at 42 U.S. C. §2000e–5(e)(3)(A), but it
did not disturb the reasoning of the precedents on which Ledbetter was
based. Cf. Ledbetter, supra, at 627, n. 2 (discussing similar amendment
abrogating the precise holding of Lorance v. AT&T Technologies, Inc.,
490 U.S. 900 (1989)).
6                    GREEN v. BRENNAN

                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

                              C
   These principles lead to the following rule for construc-
tive discharge cases: An employee’s resignation triggers a
fresh limitations period if the resignation itself constitutes
an “intentionally discriminatory” act of the employer. In
my view, an employee’s resignation in the face of intoler-
able working conditions can be considered a discriminatory
act of the employer when the employer makes conditions
intolerable with the specific discriminatory intent of forc-
ing the employee to resign. If the employer lacks that
intent, however, the limitations period runs from the
discriminatory act that precipitated the resignation.
   This approach reflects the fact that there are two kinds
of constructive discharge. Much of the disagreement
between the majority and dissent stems from their differ-
ing views of the nature of constructive discharge. To the
majority, constructive discharge is always a standalone
“claim distinct from the underlying discriminatory act.”
Ante, at 11. To JUSTICE THOMAS and the friend of the
Court we appointed to defend the judgment below, con-
structive discharge is never a separate claim, but merely
“a counterdefense to an employer’s contention that a
resignation was voluntary” that allows the resigning
employee to recover backpay and other relief unavailable
to employees who quit voluntarily. Post, at 9. As I see it,
each side is partly right. The label “constructive dis-
charge” is best understood to refer to two different (though
related) concepts, one a distinct claim and one not. This
case requires us to distinguish between the two and to
“identify with care the specific employment practice that is
at issue.” Ledbetter, supra, at 624 (citing Morgan, supra,
at 110–111).
                             1
  The first kind of constructive discharge occurs when an
employer subjects an employee to intolerable conditions
                 Cite as: 578 U. S. ____ (2016)            7

                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

with the specific discriminatory intent of forcing the em-
ployee to quit. In this situation, the employer has deliber-
ately terminated the employee—a discrete employment
action. The discharge is termed “constructive,” however,
because it is formally effected by the employee’s resigna-
tion rather than the employer’s pink slip. The termination
can nevertheless be considered a discriminatory act of the
employer because the employer intends to terminate the
employee and—through the imposition of intolerable
conditions—forces the employee to “rubberstamp” that
decision by resigning. Cf. Staub v. Proctor Hospital, 562
U.S. 411, 425 (2011) (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment);
id., at 419 (majority opinion) (“Animus and responsibility
for [an] adverse action can both be attributed to [an] ear-
lier agent . . . if the adverse action is the intended conse-
quence of that agent’s discriminatory conduct”). Because
the resignation is the “act that consummates the discrimi-
natory employment practice” of terminating the employee,
Ledbetter, supra, at 629, it triggers a fresh limitations
period. In such cases, the constructive discharge should,
like a formal discharge, be treated as a distinct cause of
action—what we might call a proper “constructive dis-
charge claim.”
   The employer’s discriminatory intent sometimes will
manifest itself only outside the limitations period. Con-
sider, for example, an employer that demotes an employee
(say, from executive to office assistant) for discriminatory
reasons and with the intent that the loss of prestige will
force the employee to quit. By the time the employee
finally cracks and resigns, the discriminatory demotion
may be outside the limitations window and not inde-
pendently actionable. But the employer’s discriminatory
intent to terminate the employee can carry forward to the
eventual resignation. We recognized this possibility in
Ledbetter. We explained that a plaintiff generally cannot
create a timely Title VII claim by “attach[ing]” the dis-
8                    GREEN v. BRENNAN

                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

criminatory intent accompanying an act outside the limi-
tations period to another act that occurred within the
limitations period. 550 U.S., at 625, 629. At the same
time, we acknowledged that “there may be instances
where the elements forming a cause of action”—
discriminatory intent and an employment action—“span
more than 180 days” (that is, the applicable limitations
period). Id., at 631, n. 3. In such a case, we said, the
limitations period would start to run when “the employ-
ment practice was executed,” because that is when “[t]he
act and intent had . . . been joined.” Ibid. Under my
example, then, the employer “forms an illegal discrimina-
tory intent” to terminate the employee at the time of the
demotion, but the termination is not “executed” or “con-
summated” until the employee resigns some time later.
Ibid.; id., at 629. Only at that point have the discrimina-
tory intent to terminate and the act of termination been
“joined,” and therefore only at that point does the limita-
tions period for the wrongful discharge start to run.
                             2
   The second kind of constructive discharge occurs when
an employer imposes intolerable conditions for discrimina-
tory reasons but does not intend to force an employee to
resign. This is quite different from an ordinary discharge
because the critical element of intent is missing. The
resignation cannot be considered an intentionally discrim-
inatory act of the employer because it is not something the
employer deliberately brought about; it is simply a later-
arising consequence of the earlier discrimination. The
resignation thus does not trigger a fresh limitations period
or give rise to a separate cause of action. See Evans, 431
U.S., at 558 (A nondiscriminatory act that “gives present
effect to a past act of discrimination” is not actionable);
Ricks, 449 U.S., at 258 (“[T]he proper focus is upon the
time of the discriminatory acts, not upon the time at which
                    Cite as: 578 U. S. ____ (2016)                 9

                  ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

the consequences of the acts became most painful” (inter-
nal quotation marks and brackets omitted)); Ledbetter,
supra, at 628 (“A new violation does not occur, and a new
[limitations] period does not commence, upon the occur-
rence of subsequent nondiscriminatory acts that entail
adverse effects resulting from the past discrimination”).
   This does not let the employer off the hook. It is still
liable for the acts of discrimination that precipitated the
resignation, provided that the employee properly and
timely challenges them. And in a suit brought on those
underlying acts, the resignation—if reasonable—“is assim-
ilated to a formal discharge for remedial purposes.” Penn-
sylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U.S. 129, 141 (2004)
(emphasis added). The resigning employee can recover, as
damages for the underlying discrimination, “all damages
[that would be] available for formal discharge” but which
are normally unavailable to employees who voluntarily
quit. Id., at 147, n. 8; see post, at 8–9 (THOMAS, J., dis-
senting). A resignation that is the reasonable but unin-
tended result of the employer’s discriminatory acts thus
does not lead to a standalone “constructive discharge
claim.” Instead, it is a basis for increasing damages
on the underlying discrimination claim—what we might
call a “constructive discharge damages enhancement.”
See Suders, supra, at 148 (analogizing constructive dis-
charge to “an actual termination in damages-enhancing
respects”).4
   The majority asserts that in Suders the Court “expressly
held” that constructive discharge is always its own distinct
——————
  4 These enhanced damages would also be available in a suit based on

the underlying discrimination where the employer intended to make
the employee resign. Intent to force the resignation is necessary to
pursue constructive discharge as a separate claim from the underlying
discrimination, but it certainly does not prevent an employee from
pursuing greater damages for the underlying discrimination on a
constructive discharge theory.
10                   GREEN v. BRENNAN

                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

claim. Ante, at 11. I do not think that the Suders Court
would have taken such pains to qualify its statements that
a constructive discharge is akin to an actual termination
“for remedial purposes” and “in damages-enhancing re-
spects,” 542 U.S., at 141, 148, had that been its intention.
Nor was it necessary for the Court to resolve whether
constructive discharge is a separate cause of action or
merely a basis for enhancing damages. The majority
observes that Suders referred to a “claim” for constructive
discharge. See ante, at 11. But the use of that term does
not indicate that constructive discharge is (always) an
independent cause of action any more than stray refer-
ences to a “claim for punitive damages,” e.g., BMW of
North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 564 (1996);
Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U.S.
52, 58 (1995), mean that punitive damages are actionable
independent of an underlying tort claim.
    The majority also asserts that intent to cause a resigna-
tion is unnecessary for a constructive discharge cause of
action because the “whole point” of constructive discharge
is to treat the resignation like a firing. Ante, at 11. I had
thought that the “whole point” of a Title VII disparate-
treatment claim was to combat intentional discrimination.
See, e.g., Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S.
977, 1002 (1988) (Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan and
Marshall, JJ., concurring in part and concurring in judg-
ment) (“[A] disparate-treatment challenge focuses exclu-
sively on the intent of the employer”). A resignation can-
not be deemed the equivalent of an actionable intentional
termination if the employer lacks intent to terminate. See
Staub, 562 U.S., at 417–418 (holding that a person who
“did not intend to cause [a] dismissal” cannot be deemed
“responsible” for the dismissal, even if the dismissal was
the “result” or “foreseeable consequence” of the person’s
actions); see also id., at 417 (“Intentional torts such as this
. . . generally require that the actor intend the consequences
                     Cite as: 578 U. S. ____ (2016)                   11

                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

of an act, not simply the act itself ” (internal quotation
marks omitted)). But as I have explained, a resignation in
those circumstances may still be treated like a firing for
damages purposes. Our cases demand nothing more.
                             II

                             A

   The framework I propose respects the fundamental rule
that an act done with discriminatory intent must have
occurred within the limitations period. It also comports
with the default rule that limitations periods start to run
when a cause of action accrues. When an employer in-
tends to force an employee to resign, the resignation gives
rise to a new cause of action for constructive discharge,
with a limitations period that runs from the date of the
resignation. But when an employer does not intend to
force the employee to resign, the employee’s only cause of
action is based on the underlying discriminatory acts, and
the limitations period runs from the time that claim ac-
crued.5 It is thus entirely unnecessary for the majority to
abandon the discriminatory-intent requirement in service
of the “standard” limitations rule. These two rules fit
together perfectly once one appreciates the dual nature of
constructive discharge.
   It is abundantly clear that the majority has abandoned
the discriminatory-intent requirement and would deem a
constructive discharge claim timely even if no discrimina-
tory act occurred within the limitations period. The ma-
jority admits as much. It declares that the employer’s
——————
  5 For example, if an unintended resignation was prompted by a dis-

crete act like a humiliating demotion or transfer, the limitations period
would run from the date of demotion or transfer. See Morgan, 536
U.S., at 110–113. If the resignation was prompted by an intolerable
hostile work environment, the limitations period would run from any
act that contributed to the hostile work environment. See id., at 117–
118.
12                   GREEN v. BRENNAN

                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

discriminatory conduct and the employee’s resignation are
both “part of the ‘matter alleged to be discriminatory,’ ”
and therefore (in its view) the resignation may trigger the
limitations period “whatever the role of discrimination in
[the resignation] element.” Ante, at 8 (emphasis added).
To support this dubious proposition, the majority cites
Morgan’s holding that an individual act contributing to a
hostile work environment need not be independently
actionable for the act to start a fresh limitations period.
Ante, at 8–9. This analogy is particularly inapt because
Green’s constructive discharge claim is based on a discrete
act, not a hostile work environment. See supra, at 4.
Even setting that aside, Morgan held only that an act
contributing to a hostile work environment need not be
independently actionable by dint of its severity. That is
because a hostile work environment claim is based on the
“cumulative effect of individual acts” that may not “ ‘suffi-
ciently affect the conditions of employment to implicate
Title VII’ ” unless considered in the aggregate. 536 U.S.,
at 115 (emphasis added). Nothing in Morgan suggests
that the limitations period for a hostile work environment
claim can run from an act that is not discriminatory. To
the contrary, the Court referred to individual “act[s] of
harassment”—such as “racial jokes, . . . racially derogatory
acts, . . . negative comments regarding the capacity of
blacks to be supervisors, and . . . various racial epithets”—
as triggering the limitations period. Id., at 115, 120 (em-
phasis added).
                             B
  The majority opines that its rule is better for employees
because it prevents the limitations period from expiring
before an employee resigns. Ante, at 9. Things are not
that simple. The majority’s rule benefits only those em-
ployees who can meet the demanding standard for con-
structive discharge, while setting a springe for those who
                     Cite as: 578 U. S. ____ (2016)                   13

                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

cannot. Constructive discharge is an “aggravated” form of
discrimination involving truly “intolerable” working condi-
tions that leave an employee no choice but to resign.
Suders, 542 U.S., at 146–147. This is an objective stand-
ard, id., at 141, and what is subjectively intolerable to a
particular employee may strike a court or jury as merely
unpleasant.
   So imagine an employee who is subjected to sexual
harassment at her federal workplace but—relying on the
majority’s rule—does not pursue EEO counseling until 45
days after the harassment leads her to resign. Suppose
too that the last act of harassment occurred the day before
she resigned. If a court ultimately concludes that the
harassment was objectively intolerable and the employee
was justified in resigning, she can recover for the con-
structive discharge. But if it turns out that she has
proved only “ordinary discrimination” without the “some-
thing more” needed to establish constructive discharge,
id., at 147 (internal quotation marks omitted), the em-
ployee is doubly out of luck: Not only does her constructive
discharge fail on the merits, but any “lesser included”
hostile work environment claim that she might have
brought (and prevailed on), id., at 149, is time barred.
Encouraging employees to wait until after resigning to
pursue discrimination claims thus may needlessly deprive
unwary discrimination victims of relief.
   The better approach is to encourage employees to seek
EEO counseling (or, in the private sector, file an EEOC
charge) at the earliest opportunity, based on the underly-
ing discriminatory acts.6 Every allegation of constructive
discharge must be based on an actionable discriminatory
practice, see ibid.; 1 B. Lindemann, P. Grossman, & C.

Weirich, Employment Discrimination Law 21–49 (5th ed.
2012), for which the employee can immediately seek coun-
seling and pursue a discrimination claim. If the employee
later resigns, he or she can seek damages from the resig-
nation as part of that timely claim. See supra, at 9, and
n. 4. Under the framework I have set forth, an employee
who fails to pursue the underlying discrimination claim
can still pursue a standalone constructive discharge claim
so long as there is sufficient evidence that the employer
acted with intent to force the employee to resign. This will
often be the case when working conditions are so intoler-
able that a reasonable employee would be compelled to quit.
The employer will usually be aware that conditions are
terrible, and “[ p]roof that a defendant acted knowingly
very often gives rise to a reasonable inference that the
defendant also acted purposely.” Loughrin v. United
States, 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (ALITO, J., concurring in
part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3).7 But the
possibility of recovering damages for only the constructive
discharge, and not for discrimination suffered before the
resignation, will be an unsatisfactory alternative for many
employees who have suffered through unendurable work-
ing conditions.

  7 Given   this inference, it is hard to see why the majority thinks that it
“would often be difficult to allege plausibly” that such an employer
intended to force the employee to resign. Ante, at 12. It is not inher-
ently more difficult (and it will often be easier) to allege and prove that
an employer intended the foreseeable consequences of its actions than
it is to allege and prove that an employer acted because of discrimina-
tory animus against an employee’s race, sex, religion, or other protected
characteristic—a burden every Title VII plaintiff must carry.

question therefore is whether Green adduced sufficient
evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that
the Postal Service intended to force his resignation when
it presented him with the settlement agreement. If so,
then the limitations period ran from the date of Green’s
resignation.
   I have little trouble concluding that Green has carried
his burden. Indeed, the Postal Service virtually concedes
the point. It observes that the agreement expressly stated
that Green would retire, and provided for his reporting to
duty in Wamsutter, Wyoming, only in the event that the
retirement fell through. App. 60–61; Brief for Respondent
33. A jury could reasonably conclude that the Postal
Service, by offering Green a choice between retiring and
taking a lower paying job hundreds of miles away, in-
tended to make him choose retirement. Accordingly, for sum-
mary judgment purposes, the 45-day window for contact-
ing an EEO counselor ran from the date on which Green
resigned—or, more precisely, the date on which he gave
the Postal Service notice of his retirement, see ante, at 16.
   I am inclined to agree with Green that—viewing the
evidence in the light most favorable to him—he did not
give notice of his retirement until he submitted his re-
tirement papers, making his claim timely. Although the
settlement agreement provided that he would retire, it
alternatively allowed him to transfer to Wyoming. Unless
Green would have been turned away from the Wamsutter
Post Office despite that language had he chosen to go
there, it was not until Green submitted his retirement
papers that one could say with certainty that his position
would be terminated rather than transferred. That said,
like the majority I am content to leave this question for
the Tenth Circuit to tackle on remand. I accordingly
concur in the judgment.

15709,Justice Sotomayor,majority,False,Green v. Brennan,,2016,2.0,"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as
amended, 42 U.S. C. §2000e et seq., prohibits employers
from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion,
sex, or national origin, or retaliating against their employ-
ees for opposing or seeking relief from such discrimination.
Before a federal civil servant can sue his employer for
violating Title VII, he must, among other things, “initiate
contact” with an Equal Employment Opportunity counse-
lor at his agency “within 45 days of the date of the matter
alleged to be discriminatory.” 29 CFR §1614.105(a)(1)
(2015).
  If an employee claims he has been fired for discrimina-
tory reasons, the “matter alleged to be discriminatory”
includes the discharge itself and the 45-day limitations
period begins running only after the employee is fired.
  We address here when the limitations period begins to
run for an employee who was not fired, but resigns in the
face of intolerable discrimination—a “constructive” dis-
charge. We hold that, in such circumstances, the “matter
alleged to be discriminatory” includes the employee’s

resignation, and that the 45-day clock for a constructive
discharge begins running only after the employee resigns.
                              I
   We recite the following facts in the light most favorable
to petitioner Marvin Green, against whom the District
Court entered summary judgment. Green is a black man
who worked for the Postal Service for 35 years. In 2008,
he was serving as the postmaster for Englewood, Colorado
when he applied for a promotion to the vacant postmaster
position in nearby Boulder. He was passed over. Shortly
thereafter, Green complained he was denied the promotion
because of his race.
   Green’s relations with his supervisors crumbled follow-
ing his complaint. Tensions peaked on December 11,
2009, when two of Green’s supervisors accused him of
intentionally delaying the mail—a criminal offense. See
18 U.S. C. §1703. They informed Green that the Postal
Service’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) was inves-
tigating the charge and that OIG agents had arrived to
interview him as part of their investigation. After Green
met with the OIG agents, his supervisors gave him a letter
reassigning him to off-duty status until the matter was
resolved. Even though the OIG agents reported to Green’s
supervisors that no further investigation was warranted,
the supervisors continued to represent to Green that “the
OIG is all over this” and that the “criminal” charge “could
be a life changer.” App. 53.
   On December 16, 2009, Green and the Postal Service
signed an agreement whose meaning remains disputed.
Relevant here, the Postal Service promised not to pursue
criminal charges in exchange for Green’s promise to leave
his post in Englewood. The agreement also apparently
gave Green a choice: effective March 31, 2010, he could
either retire or report for duty in Wamsutter, Wyoming—
population 451—at a salary considerably lower than what

he earned in his Denver suburb. Green chose to retire and
submitted his resignation to the Postal Service on Febru-
ary 9, 2010, effective March 31.
   On March 22—41 days after submitting his resignation
paperwork to the Postal Service on February 9, but 96
days after signing the settlement agreement on December
16—Green contacted an Equal Employment Opportunity
(EEO) counselor to report an unlawful constructive dis-
charge. He contended that his supervisors had threatened
criminal charges and negotiated the resulting agreement
in retaliation for his original complaint.1 He alleged that
the choice he had been given effectively forced his resigna-
tion in violation of Title VII.
   Green eventually filed suit in the Federal District Court
for the District of Colorado, alleging, inter alia, that the
Postal Service constructively discharged him. The Postal
Service moved for summary judgment, arguing that Green
had failed to make timely contact with an EEO counselor
within 45 days of the “matter alleged to be discrimina-
tory,” as required by 29 CFR §1614.105(a)(1). The District
Court granted the Postal Service’s motion for summary
judgment.
   The Tenth Circuit affirmed, holding that the “matter
alleged to be discriminatory” encompassed only the Postal
Service’s discriminatory actions and not Green’s inde-
pendent decision to resign on February 9. Green v. Do­
nahue, 760 F.3d 1135 (2014). Therefore, the 45-day limi-
tations period started running when both parties signed
the settlement agreement on December 16, 2009. Accord-
ingly, because 96 days passed between the agreement and
when Green contacted an EEO counselor on March 22,

2010, his constructive-discharge claim was time barred.
  Two other Courts of Appeals agree with the Tenth Cir-
cuit’s view that the limitations period begins to run for a
constructive-discharge claim after the employer’s last
discriminatory act.2 As the Tenth Circuit recognized,
however, other Courts of Appeals have held that the limi-
tations period for a constructive-discharge claim does not
begin to run until the employee resigns.3
  We granted certiorari to resolve this split. 575 U. S. ___
(2015). Because no party here supports the Tenth Cir-
cuit’s holding that an employee’s resignation is not part of
the “matter alleged to be discriminatory,” we appointed
Catherine M. A. Carroll to defend that aspect of the
judgment below. 576 U. S. ___ (2015). She has ably
discharged her duties and the Court thanks her for her
service.

  Before a federal civil servant can sue his employer in
court for discriminating against him in violation of Title
VII, he must first exhaust his administrative remedies. 42
U.S. C. §2000e–16(c). To exhaust those remedies, the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has
promulgated regulations that require, among other things,
that a federal employee consult with an EEO counselor
prior to filing a discrimination lawsuit. Specifically, he
“must initiate contact with a Counselor within 45 days of
the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in
the case of personnel action, within 45 days of the effective

date of the action.” 29 CFR §1614.105(a)(1).4 The timeli-
ness of Green’s claim therefore turns on our interpretation
of this EEOC regulation implementing Title VII.5
   Although we begin our interpretation of the regulation
with its text, the text in this case is not particularly help-
ful. Nowhere does §1614.105 indicate whether a “matter
alleged to be discriminatory” in a constructive-discharge
claim includes the employee’s resignation, as Green con-
tends, or only the employer’s discriminatory conduct, as
amica contends. The word “matter” simply means “an
allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense,” Black’s
Law Dictionary 1126 (10th ed. 2014)—a term that could
readily apply to a discrimination-precipitated resignation.
So the “matter alleged to be discriminatory” could refer
to all of the allegations underlying a claim of discrimina-
tion, including the employee’s resignation, or only to
those allegations concerning the employer’s discrimina-
tory conduct. We therefore must turn to other canons of
interpretation.
   The most helpful canon in this context is “the ‘standard
rule’ ” for limitations periods. Graham County Soil &
Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson,
545 U.S. 409, 418 (2005). Ordinarily, a “ ‘limitations
period commences when the plaintiff has a complete and
present cause of action.’ ” Ibid. “[A] cause of action does
not become ‘complete and present’ for limitations purposes
——————
  4 Thisregulation, applicable to federal employees only, has a statutory
analog for private-sector Title VII plaintiffs, who are required to file a
charge with the EEOC within 180 or 300 days “after the alleged unlaw-
ful employment practice occurred.” 42 U.S. C. §2000e–5(e)(1). Al-
though the language is different, the EEOC treats the federal and
private-sector employee limitations periods as identical in operation.
See EEOC Compliance Manual: Threshold Issues §2–IV(C)(1), n. 179.
  5 Green does not contend that his alleged constructive discharge is a

“personnel action.” See Brief for Petitioner 17–18; Green v. Donahoe,
760 F.3d 1135, 1144, n. 3 (CA10 2014). We therefore address the
“matter alleged to be discriminatory” clause only.

                      Opinion of the Court

until the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.” Bay Area
Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar
Corp. of Cal., 522 U.S. 192, 201 (1997). Although the
standard rule can be displaced such that the limitations
period begins to run before a plaintiff can file a suit, we
“will not infer such an odd result in the absence of any
such indication” in the text of the limitations period.
Reiter v. Cooper, 507 U.S. 258, 267 (1993).
  Applying this default rule, we are persuaded that the
“matter alleged to be discriminatory” in a constructive-
discharge claim necessarily includes the employee’s resig-
nation for three reasons. First, in the context of a
constructive-discharge claim, a resignation is part of the
“complete and present cause of action” necessary before a
limitations period ordinarily begins to run. Second, noth-
ing in the regulation creating the limitations period here,
§1614.105, clearly indicates an intent to displace this
standard rule. Third, practical considerations confirm the
merit of applying the standard rule here. We therefore
interpret the term “matter alleged to be discriminatory” for
a constructive-discharge claim to include the date Green
resigned.
                              A
   The standard rule for limitations periods requires us
first to determine what is a “complete and present cause of
action” for a constructive-discharge claim. We hold that
such a claim accrues only after an employee resigns.
   The constructive-discharge doctrine contemplates a
situation in which an employer discriminates against an
employee to the point such that his “working conditions
become so intolerable that a reasonable person in the
employee’s position would have felt compelled to resign.”
Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U.S. 129, 141
(2004). When the employee resigns in the face of such
circumstances, Title VII treats that resignation as tanta-
                 Cite as: 578 U. S. ____ (2016)           7

                     Opinion of the Court

mount to an actual discharge. Id., at 142–143.
   A claim of constructive discharge therefore has two
basic elements. A plaintiff must prove first that he was
discriminated against by his employer to the point where a
reasonable person in his position would have felt com-
pelled to resign. Id., at 148. But he must also show that
he actually resigned. Ibid. (“A constructive discharge
involves both an employee’s decision to leave and precipi-
tating conduct . . .” (emphasis added)). In other words, an
employee cannot bring a constructive-discharge claim
until he is constructively discharged. Only after both
elements are satisfied can he file suit to obtain relief.
   Under the standard rule for limitations periods, the
limitations period should begin to run for a constructive-
discharge claim only after a plaintiff resigns. At that
point—and not before—he can file a suit for constructive
discharge. So only at that point—and not before—does he
have a “complete and present” cause of action. And only
after he has a complete and present cause of action does a
limitations period ordinarily begin to run. Cf. Mac’s Shell
Service, Inc. v. Shell Oil Products Co., 559 U.S. 175, 189–
190 (2010) (the limitations period for a constructive termi-
nation of a franchise agreement starts running when the
agreement is constructively terminated).
   In this respect, a claim that an employer constructively
discharged an employee is no different from a claim that
an employer actually discharged an employee. An ordi-
nary wrongful discharge claim also has two basic ele-
ments: discrimination and discharge. See St. Mary’s
Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506 (1993); 1 B.
Lindemann, P. Grossman, & C. Weirich, Employment
Discrimination Law 21–33 (5th ed. 2012) (Lindemann)
(“The sine qua non of a discharge case is, of course, a
discharge”). The claim accrues when the employee is
fired. At that point—and not before—he has a “complete
and present cause of action.” So at that point—and not
8                    GREEN v. BRENNAN

                      Opinion of the Court

before—the limitations period begins to run.
  With claims of either constructive discharge or actual
discharge, the standard rule thus yields the same result: a
limitations period should not begin to run until after the
discharge itself. In light of this rule, we interpret the term
“matter alleged to be discriminatory” in §1614.105 to refer
to all of the elements that make up a constructive-
discharge claim—including an employee’s resignation.
                               B
  Although the standard rule dictates that a limitations
period should commence only after a claim accrues, there
is an exception to that rule when the text creating the
limitations period clearly indicates otherwise. See, e.g.,
Dodd v. United States, 545 U.S. 353, 360 (2005). Nothing
in the text of Title VII or the regulation, however, suggests
that the standard rule should be displaced here. To the
contrary, the language of the regulation confirms our
application of the default rule.
  As noted previously, the word “matter” generally refers
to “an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense.”
Black’s Law Dictionary 1126. The natural reading of
“matter alleged to be discriminatory” thus refers to the
allegation forming the basis of the discrimination claim—
here, a claim of constructive discharge. And as discussed
above, a constructive discharge claim requires two basic
allegations: discriminatory conduct by the employer that
leads to resignation of the employee. So long as those acts
are part of the same, single claim under consideration,
they are part of the “matter alleged to be discriminatory,”
whatever the role of discrimination in each individual
element of the claim. Cf. National Railroad Passenger
Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 115–121 (2002)
(holding that a hostile-work-environment claim is a single
“unlawful employment practice” that includes every act
composing that claim, whether those acts are inde-
                 Cite as: 578 U. S. ____ (2016)            9

                     Opinion of the Court

pendently actionable or not).
                              C
   Finally, we are also persuaded that applying the stand-
ard rule for limitations periods to constructive discharge
makes a good deal of practical sense. Starting the limita-
tions clock ticking before a plaintiff can actually sue for
constructive discharge serves little purpose in furthering
the goals of a limitations period—and it actively negates
Title VII’s remedial structure. Cf. Zipes v. Trans World
Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 398 (1982) (holding that
the Title VII limitations period should be construed to
“honor the remedial purpose of the legislation as a whole
without negating the particular purpose of the filing
requirement”).
   This Court has recognized “that the limitations perio[d]
should not commence to run so soon that it becomes diffi-
cult for a layman to invoke the protection of the civil
rights statutes.” Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449
U.S. 250, 262, n. 16 (1980). If the limitations period
begins to run following the employer’s precipitating dis-
criminatory conduct, but before the employee’s resigna-
tion, the employee will be forced to file a discrimination
complaint after the employer’s conduct and later amend
the complaint to allege constructive discharge after he
resigns. Nothing in the regulation suggests it intended to
require a layperson, while making this difficult decision,
to follow such a two-step process in order to preserve any
remedy if he is constructively discharged.
   Moreover, forcing an employee to lodge a complaint
before he can bring a claim for constructive discharge
places that employee in a difficult situation. An employee
who suffered discrimination severe enough that a reason-
able person in his shoes would resign might nevertheless
force himself to tolerate that discrimination for a period of
time. He might delay his resignation until he can afford to
10                  GREEN v. BRENNAN

                     Opinion of the Court

leave. Or he might delay in light of other circumstances,
as in the case of a teacher waiting until the end of the
school year to resign. Tr. 17. And, if he feels he must stay
for a period of time, he may be reluctant to complain about
discrimination while still employed. A complaint could
risk termination—an additional adverse consequence that
he may have to disclose in future job applications.
                             III
  Amica and the dissent read “matter alleged to be dis-
criminatory” as having a clear enough meaning to displace
our reliance on the standard rule for limitations periods.
They argue that “matter” is not equivalent to “claim” or
“cause of action,” and that the use of the phrase “matter
alleged to be discriminatory” is a sufficiently clear state-
ment that the standard claim accrual rule should not
apply. According to amica and the dissent, “matter” refers
only to the discriminatory acts of the Postal Service, not
Green’s resignation.
  We disagree. There is nothing inherent in the phrase
“matter alleged to be discriminatory” that clearly limits it
to employer conduct. Rather, as discussed above, the term
can reasonably be interpreted to include the factual basis
for a claim. Green is not alleging just that the Postal
Service discriminated against him. He claims that the
discrimination left him no choice but to resign.
  Amica and the dissent dispute that a constructive dis-
charge is a separate claim. According to amica and the
dissent, the constructive-discharge doctrine merely allows
a plaintiff to expand any underlying discrimination claim
to include the damages from leaving his job, thereby in-
creasing his available remedies. See 1 Lindemann 21–49
(constructive discharge allows plaintiff to seek backpay,
front pay, or reinstatement). In support of this argument,
amica and the dissent emphasize this Court’s statement in
Suders that “[u]nder the constructive discharge doctrine,
                 Cite as: 578 U. S. ____ (2016)          11

                     Opinion of the Court

an employee’s reasonable decision to resign because of
unendurable working conditions is assimilated to a formal
discharge for remedial purposes.” 542 U.S., at 141 (em-
phasis added); see also id., at 148 (“[A] constructive dis-
charge is functionally the same as an actual termination
in damages-enhancing respects”).
   But the Court did not hold in Suders that a constructive
discharge is tantamount to a formal discharge for remedial
purposes exclusively. To the contrary, it expressly held
that constructive discharge is a claim distinct from the
underlying discriminatory act. Id., at 149 (holding that a
hostile-work-environment claim is a “lesser included
component” of the “graver claim of hostile-environment
constructive discharge”). This holding was no mere dic-
tum. See id., at 142 (“[A] claim for constructive discharge
lies under Title VII”). We see no reason to excise an em-
ployee’s resignation from his constructive-discharge claim
for purposes of the limitations period.
   The concurrence sets out a theory that there are two
kinds of constructive discharge for purposes of the limita-
tions period: constructive discharge “claims” where the
employer “makes conditions intolerable with the specific
discriminatory intent of forcing the employee to resign,”
and constructive discharge “damages” where the employer
does not intend to force the employee to quit, but the
discriminatory conditions of employment are so intolerable
that the employee quits anyway. Post, at 6–11 (ALITO, J.,
concurring in judgment). According to the concurrence,
the limitations period does not begin to run until an em-
ployee resigns under the “claim” theory of constructive
discharge, but begins at the last discriminatory act before
resignation under the “damages” theory.
   This sometimes-a-claim-sometimes-not theory of con-
structive discharge is novel and contrary to the construc-
tive discharge doctrine. The whole point of allowing an
employee to claim “constructive” discharge is that in cir-
12                       GREEN v. BRENNAN

                          Opinion of the Court

cumstances of discrimination so intolerable that a reason-
able person would resign, we treat the employee’s resigna-
tion as though the employer actually fired him. Suders,
542 U.S., at 141–143.6 We do not also require an em-
ployee to come forward with proof—proof that would often
be difficult to allege plausibly—that not only was the dis-
crimination so bad that he had to quit, but also that his
quitting was his employer’s plan all along.
   Amica and the dissent also argue that their interpreta-
tion is more consistent with this Court’s prior precedent
on when the limitations period begins to run for discrimi-
nation claims. Under their interpretation, Green’s resig-
nation was not part of the discriminatory “matter,” but
was instead the mere inevitable consequence of the Postal
Service’s discriminatory conduct, and therefore cannot be
used to extend the limitations period. See Brief for Court-
Appointed Amica Curiae in Support of Judgment Below

  6 The concurrence suggests that its theory is consistent with state-

ments in the Suders opinion that constructive discharge is akin to an
actual discharge “ ‘for remedial purposes’ ” and in “ ‘damages-enhancing
respects.’ ” Post, at 10 (opinion of ALITO, J.) (quoting Suders, 542 U.S.,
at 141, 148). This ignores the more obvious explanation for this qualifi-
cation: The Court was distinguishing between the merits of a claim of
constructive discharge generally, where resignation is imputed as a
discriminatory act of the employer, and the affirmative defense avail-
able to an employer in a hostile work environment claim specifically,
which allows an employer to defend against a hostile work environment
claim in certain circumstances if it took no “ ‘official act’ ” against the
employee. Id., at 143–146. The Court in Suders recognized that it
would be bizarre to always impute resignation as an “official act” of the
employer in a constructive discharge hostile work environment case
and prohibit the employer from relying on the no-“official-act” defense,
because it would make it easier to prove the “graver” claim of a con-
structive discharge hostile work environment than to prove a hostile
work environment claim. Id., at 148–149. Thus, the Court declined to
hold that resignation in a constructive discharge case was categorically
an “official act” in all instances. Ibid. In other words, the Court sought
a measure of parity between constructive discharge and ordinary
discrimination—parity that we extend to the limitations period here.

                      Opinion of the Court

21–27 (Brief for Amica Curiae) (citing Ledbetter v. Good­
year Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U.S. 618 (2007), overruled by
statute, Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, 123 Stat. 5;
Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250; United Air
Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553 (1977)); post, at 3–7
(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (citing Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, and
Chardon v. Fernandez, 454 U.S. 6 (1981) (per curiam)).
Similarly, the concurrence argues these cases require that
an act done with discriminatory intent must occur within
the limitations period. Post, at 4 (opinion of ALITO, J.).
   But these cases are consistent with the standard rule
that a limitations period begins to run after a claim ac-
crues, not after an inevitable consequence of that claim.
In Ricks, for example, the Court considered the discrimi-
nation claim of a college faculty member who was denied
tenure and given a 1-year “ ‘terminal’ ” contract for his last
year teaching. 449 U.S., at 258. The plaintiff ’s claim
accrued—and he could have sued—when the college in-
formed him he would be denied tenure and gave him
“explicit notice that his employment would end” when his
1-year contract expired. Ibid. The Court held that the
limitations period began to run on that date, and not after
his 1-year contract expired. That final year of teaching
was merely an inevitable consequence of the tenure denial
the plaintiff claimed was discriminatory.
   Green’s resignation, by contrast, is not merely an inevi-
table consequence of the discrimination he suffered; it is
an essential part of his constructive-discharge claim. That
is, Green could not sue for constructive discharge until he
actually resigned. Of course, Green could not resign and
then wait until the consequences of that resignation be-
came most painful to complain. For example, he could not
use the date of the expiration of his health insurance after
his resignation to extend the limitations period. But the
“inevitable consequence” principle of Ricks, Ledbetter, and
Evans does not change the focus of the limitations period,
14                        GREEN v. BRENNAN

                           Opinion of the Court

which remains on the claim of discrimination itself. See
Lewis v. Chicago, 560 U.S. 205, 214 (2010) (holding Evans
and its progeny “establish only that a Title VII plaintiff
must show a present violation within the limitations
period” (internal quotation marks omitted)); National
Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U.S., at
115–121 (holding limitations period for hostile-work-
environment claim runs from the last act composing the
claim).7 For a constructive discharge, the claim does not
exist until the employee resigns.
  Finally, amica contends that her interpretation of the
regulation better advances the EEOC’s goal of promoting
conciliation for federal employees through early, informal
contact with an EEO counselor. See Exec. Order No.
11478, §4, 34 Fed. Reg. 12986 (1969) (counseling for federal
employees “shall encourage the resolution of employee
problems on an informal basis”). The dissent suggests
that our holding will make a discrimination victim the
master of his complaint, permitting him to “ ‘exten[d] the
limitation[s period] indefinitely’ ” by waiting to resign. Post,
at 7 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). The concurrence claims that
an employee who relies on the limitations period in waiting
——————
  7 The dissent relies on Morgan’s other holding that, unlike a hostile-

work-environment claim that may comprise many discriminatory acts,
discrete claims of discrimination based on independent discriminatory
acts cannot be aggregated to extend the limitations period. See post, at
3 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (citing 536 U.S., at 109–113). But this just
proves the point: The analysis for the limitations period turns on the
nature of the specific legal claim at issue. In Morgan, the Court noted
that even if a claim of discrimination based on a single discriminatory
act is time barred, that same act could still be used as part of the basis
for a hostile-work-environment claim, so long as one other act that was
part of that same hostile-work-environment claim occurred within the
limitations period. Id., at 117 (“It is precisely because the entire hostile
work environment encompasses a single unlawful employment practice
that we do not hold, as have some of the Circuits, that the plaintiff may
not base a suit on individual acts that occurred outside the statute of
limitations . . . ”).

                      Opinion of the Court

to resign is “doubly out of luck” if his otherwise-meritorious
discrimination claim is time barred and he cannot show the
discrimination was so intolerable that it amounted to a
constructive discharge. Post, at 13 (opinion of ALITO, J.).
   These concerns are overblown. Amica may be right that
it is more difficult to achieve conciliation after an employee
resigns. But the same is true for a federal civil servant
who is fired by his agency for what the employee believes
to be a discriminatory purpose. And neither decision is
necessarily permanent—a resignation or a termination
may be undone after an employee contacts a counselor.
Conciliation, while important, does not warrant treating a
constructive discharge different from an actual discharge
for purposes of the limitations period.
   As for the dissent’s fear, we doubt that a victim of em-
ployment discrimination will continue to work in an intol-
erable environment merely because he can thereby extend
the limitations period for a claim of constructive dis-
charge. If anything, a plaintiff who wishes to prevail on
the merits of his constructive discharge claim has the
opposite incentive. A claim of constructive discharge
requires proof of a causal link between the allegedly intol-
erable conditions and the resignation. See 1 Lindemann
21–45, and n. 106.
   And as for the concurrence’s double-loser concern, no
plaintiff would be well advised to delay pursuing what he
believes to be a meritorious non-constructive-discharge-
discrimination claim on the ground that a timely filed
constructive discharge claim could resuscitate other time-
lapsed claims. The 45-day limitations period begins run-
ning on any separate underlying claim of discrimina-
tion when that claim accrues, regardless of whether the
plaintiff eventually claims constructive discharge. The
limitations-period analysis is always conducted claim by
claim.
16                  GREEN v. BRENNAN

                     Opinion of the Court

                              IV
   Our decision that a resignation triggers the limitations
period for a constructive-discharge claim raises the ques-
tion of when precisely an employee resigns. Here, Green
and the Government agree that an employee resigns when
he gives his employer definite notice of his intent to re-
sign. If an employee gives “two weeks’ notice”—telling his
employer he intends to leave after two more weeks of
employment—the limitations period begins to run on the
day he tells his employer, not his last day at work. (This
issue was not addressed by the Tenth Circuit and, accord-
ingly, amica takes no position on it. See Brief for Amica
Curiae 42.)
   We agree. A notice rule flows directly from this Court’s
precedent. In Ricks, 449 U.S., at 250, and Chardon v.
Fernandez, 454 U.S. 6, the Court explained that an ordi-
nary wrongful-discharge claim accrues—and the limita-
tions period begins to run—when the employer notifies the
employee he is fired, not on the last day of his employ-
ment. Ricks, 449 U.S., at 258–259; Chardon, 454 U.S., at
8. Likewise, here, we hold that a constructive-discharge
claim accrues—and the limitations period begins to run—
when the employee gives notice of his resignation, not on
the effective date of that resignation.
   One factual issue remains: when exactly Green gave the
Postal Service notice of his resignation. The Government
argues that Green resigned on December 16, 2009—when
he signed the settlement agreement—and that his claim is
therefore still time barred. Green argues that he did not
resign until February 9, 2010—when he submitted his
retirement paperwork—and that his claim is therefore
timely. We need not resolve this issue. Having concluded
that the limitations period for Green’s constructive-
discharge claim runs from the date he gave notice of his
resignation, we leave it to the Tenth Circuit to determine
when this in fact occurred.

            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT

                        [May 23, 2016] 


  JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in the judgment."
28975,Justice Ginsburg,majority,False,Sessions v. Morales-Santana,,2017,2.0,"This case concerns a gender-based differential in the law
governing acquisition of U. S. citizenship by a child born
abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen, the other, a
citizen of another nation. The main rule appears in
8 U.S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), now §1401(g) (2012 ed.).
Applicable to married couples, §1401(a)(7) requires a
period of physical presence in the United States for the
U. S.-citizen parent. The requirement, as initially pre­
scribed, was ten years’ physical presence prior to the
child’s birth, §601(g) (1940 ed.); currently, the requirement
is five years prebirth, §1401(g) (2012 ed.). That main rule
is rendered applicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers by
§1409(a). Congress ordered an exception, however, for
unwed U. S.-citizen mothers. Contained in §1409(c), the
exception allows an unwed mother to transmit her citizen­
ship to a child born abroad if she has lived in the United
States for just one year prior to the child’s birth.
   The respondent in this case, Luis Ramón Morales-
Santana, was born in the Dominican Republic when his
father was just 20 days short of meeting §1401(a)(7)’s
2                SESSIONS v. MORALES-SANTANA

physical-presence requirement. Opposing removal to the
Dominican Republic, Morales-Santana asserts that the
equal protection principle implicit in the Fifth Amend­
ment1 entitles him to citizenship stature. We hold that
the gender line Congress drew is incompatible with the
requirement that the Government accord to all persons
“the equal protection of the laws.” Nevertheless, we can­
not convert §1409(c)’s exception for unwed mothers into
the main rule displacing §1401(a)(7) (covering married
couples) and §1409(a) (covering unwed fathers). We must
therefore leave it to Congress to select, going forward, a
physical-presence requirement (ten years, one year, or
some other period) uniformly applicable to all children
born abroad with one U. S.-citizen and one alien parent,
wed or unwed. In the interim, the Government must
ensure that the laws in question are administered in a
manner free from gender-based discrimination.

                             A

  We first describe in greater detail the regime Congress
constructed. The general rules for acquiring U. S. citizen­
ship are found in 8 U.S. C. §1401, the first section in
Chapter 1 of Title III of the Immigration and Nationality
Act (1952 Act or INA), §301, 66 Stat. 235–236. Section
1401 sets forth the INA’s rules for determining who “shall
be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth” by
——————
   1 As this case involves federal, not state, legislation, the applicable

equality guarantee is not the Fourteenth Amendment’s explicit Equal
Protection Clause, it is the guarantee implicit in the Fifth Amend­
ment’s Due Process Clause. See Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S.
636, 638, n. 2 (1975) (“[W]hile the Fifth Amendment contains no equal
protection clause, it does forbid discrimination that is so unjustifiable
as to be violative of due process. This Court’s approach to Fifth
Amendment equal protection claims has always been precisely the
same as to equal protection claims under the Fourteenth Amendment.”

establishing a range of residency and physical-presence
requirements calibrated primarily to the parents’ nation­
ality and the child’s place of birth. §1401(a) (1958 ed.);
§1401 (2012 ed.). The primacy of §1401 in the statutory
scheme is evident. Comprehensive in coverage, §1401
provides the general framework for the acquisition of
citizenship at birth. In particular, at the time relevant
here,2 §1401(a)(7) provided for the U. S. citizenship of
     “a person born outside the geographical limits of the
     United States and its outlying possessions of parents
     one of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the
     United States who, prior to the birth of such person,
     was physically present in the United States or its out­
     lying possessions for a period or periods totaling not
     less than ten years, at least five of which were after
     attaining the age of fourteen years: Provided, That
     any periods of honorable service in the Armed Forces
     of the United States by such citizen parent may be in­
     cluded in computing the physical presence require­
     ments of this paragraph.”
Congress has since reduced the duration requirement to
five years, two after age 14. §1401(g) (2012 ed.).3
   Section 1409 pertains specifically to children with un­
married parents. Its first subsection, §1409(a), incorpo­
rates by reference the physical-presence requirements of
§1401, thereby allowing an acknowledged unwed citizen
parent to transmit U. S. citizenship to a foreign-born child

  2 Unless  otherwise noted, references to 8 U.S. C. §§1401 and 1409 are
to the 1958 edition of the U. S. Code, the version in effect when re­
spondent Morales-Santana was born. Section 1409(a) and (c) have
retained their numbering; §1401(a)(7) has become §1401(g).
   3 The reduction affects only children born on or after November 14,

1986. §8(r), 102 Stat. 2619; see §§12–13, 100 Stat. 3657. Because
Morales-Santana was born in 1962, his challenge is to the ten-years,
five-after-age-14 requirement applicable at the time of his birth.

                        Opinion of the Court

under the same terms as a married citizen parent. Section
1409(c)—a provision applicable only to unwed U. S.-citizen
mothers—states an exception to the physical-presence
requirements of §§1401 and 1409(a). Under §1409(c)’s
exception, only one year of continuous physical presence is
required before unwed mothers may pass citizenship to
their children born abroad.
                               B
   Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana moved to the
United States at age 13, and has resided in this country
most of his life. Now facing deportation, he asserts U. S.
citizenship at birth based on the citizenship of his biologi­
cal father, José Morales, who accepted parental responsi­
bility and included Morales-Santana in his household.
   José Morales was born in Guánica, Puerto Rico, on
March 19, 1900. Record 55–56. Puerto Rico was then, as
it is now, part of the United States, see Puerto Rico v.
Sanchez Valle, 579 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2016) (slip op., at 2–
4); 8 U.S. C. §1101(a)(38) (1958 ed.) (“The term United
States . . . means the continental United States, Alaska,
Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the [U. S.] Virgin Is­
lands.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); §1101(a)(38)
(2012 ed.) (similar), and José became a U. S. citizen under
the Organic Act of Puerto Rico, ch. 145, §5, 39 Stat. 953 (a
predecessor to 8 U.S. C. §1402). After living in Puerto
Rico for nearly two decades, José left his childhood home
on February 27, 1919, 20 days short of his 19th birthday,
therefore failing to satisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five
years’ physical presence after age 14. Record 57, 66. He
did so to take up employment as a builder-mechanic for a
U. S. company in the then-U. S.-occupied Dominican
Republic. Ibid.4

                         Opinion of the Court

   By 1959, José attested in a June 21, 1971 affidavit
presented to the U. S. Embassy in the Dominican Repub­
lic, he was living with Yrma Santana Montilla, a Domini­
can woman he would eventually marry. Id., at 57. In
1962, Yrma gave birth to their child, respondent Luis
Morales-Santana. Id., at 166–167. While the record
before us reveals little about Morales-Santana’s childhood,
the Dominican archives disclose that Yrma and José mar­
ried in 1970, and that José was then added to Morales­
Santana’s birth certificate as his father. Id., at 163–164,
167. José also related in the same affidavit that he was
then saving money “for the susten[ance] of [his] family” in
anticipation of undergoing surgery in Puerto Rico, where
members of his family still resided. Id., at 57. In 1975,
when Morales-Santana was 13, he moved to Puerto Rico,
id., at 368, and by 1976, the year his father died, he was
attending public school in the Bronx, a New York City
borough, id., at 140, 369.5
                             C
   In 2000, the Government placed Morales-Santana in
removal proceedings based on several convictions for
offenses under New York State Penal Law, all of them
rendered on May 17, 1995. Id., at 426. Morales-Santana
ranked as an alien despite the many years he lived in the
United States, because, at the time of his birth, his father
did not satisfy the requirement of five years’ physical
presence after age 14. See supra, at 3–4, and n. 3. An
immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s claim to
citizenship derived from the U. S. citizenship of his father,
and ordered Morales-Santana’s removal to the Dominican

Dominican Republic in 1916, and plans, beginning in late 1920, for
withdrawal).
   5 There is no question that Morales-Santana himself satisfied the

five-year residence requirement that once conditioned a child’s acquisi­
tion of citizenship under §1401(a)(7). See §1401(b).

                     Opinion of the Court

Republic. Record 253, 366; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a–49a.
In 2010, Morales-Santana moved to reopen the proceed­
ings, asserting that the Government’s refusal to recognize
that he derived citizenship from his U. S.-citizen father
violated the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee.
See Record 27, 45. The Board of Immigration Appeals
(BIA) denied the motion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a, 42a–
44a.
  The United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit reversed the BIA’s decision. 804 F.3d 520, 524
(2015). Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of
the equal protection principle as it bears on gender-based
classifications, the court held unconstitutional the differ­
ential treatment of unwed mothers and fathers. Id., at
527–535. To cure the constitutional flaw, the court further
held that Morales-Santana derived citizenship through his
father, just as he would were his mother the U. S. citizen.
Id., at 535–538. In so ruling, the Second Circuit declined
to follow the conflicting decision of the Ninth Circuit in
United States v. Flores-Villar, 536 F.3d 990 (2008), see
804 F.3d, at 530, 535, n. 17. We granted certiorari
in Flores-Villar, but ultimately affirmed by an equally
divided Court. Flores-Villar v. United States, 564 U.S.
210 (2011) ( per curiam). Taking up Morales-Santana’s
request for review, 579 U. S. ___ (2016), we consider the
matter anew.
                            II
  Because §1409 treats sons and daughters alike, Morales-
Santana does not suffer discrimination on the basis of his
gender. He complains, instead, of gender-based discrimi­
nation against his father, who was unwed at the time of
Morales-Santana’s birth and was not accorded the right an
unwed U. S.-citizen mother would have to transmit citi­
zenship to her child. Although the Government does not
contend otherwise, we briefly explain why Morales­

                         Opinion of the Court

Santana may seek to vindicate his father’s right to the
equal protection of the laws.6
  Ordinarily, a party “must assert his own legal rights”
and “cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights . . .
of third parties.” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499
(1975). But we recognize an exception where, as here, “the
party asserting the right has a close relationship with the
person who possesses the right [and] there is a hindrance
to the possessor’s ability to protect his own interests.”
Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 130 (2004) (quoting
Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 411 (1991)). José Morales’
ability to pass citizenship to his son, respondent Morales-
Santana, easily satisfies the “close relationship” require­
ment. So, too, is the “hindrance” requirement well met.
José Morales’ failure to assert a claim in his own right
“stems from disability,” not “disinterest,” Miller v. Al-
bright, 523 U.S. 420, 450 (1998) (O’Connor, J., concurring
in judgment), for José died in 1976, Record 140, many
years before the current controversy arose. See Hodel v.
Irving, 481 U.S. 704, 711–712, 723, n. 7 (1987) (children
and their guardians may assert Fifth Amendment rights
of deceased relatives). Morales-Santana is thus the “obvi­
ous claimant,” see Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197
(1976), the “best available proponent,” Singleton v. Wulff,
428 U.S. 106, 116 (1976), of his father’s right to equal
protection.

  Sections 1401 and 1409, we note, date from an era when

affirm, differentiate on the basis of gender, and therefore
attract heightened review under the Constitution’s equal

  Prescribing one rule for mothers, another for fathers,
§1409 is of the same genre as the classifications we de­
clared unconstitutional in Reed, Frontiero, Wiesenfeld,
Goldfarb, and Westcott. As in those cases, heightened
scrutiny is in order. Successful defense of legislation that
differentiates on the basis of gender, we have reiterated,
requires an “exceedingly persuasive justification.” Virginia,

   The defender of legislation that differentiates on the
basis of gender must show “at least that the [challenged]
classification serves important governmental objectives
and that the discriminatory means employed are substan­
tially related to the achievement of those objectives.”

70 (2001). Moreover, the classification must substantially
serve an important governmental interest today, for “in

recognized that new insights and societal understandings
can reveal unjustified inequality . . . that once passed
unnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges, 576

                          Opinion of the Court

the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), see 54 Stat. 1139–
1140, §1409 ended a century and a half of congressional
silence on the citizenship of children born abroad to unwed
parents.8 During this era, two once habitual, but now
untenable, assumptions pervaded our Nation’s citizenship
laws and underpinned judicial and administrative rulings:
In marriage, husband is dominant, wife subordinate;
unwed mother is the natural and sole guardian of a non-
marital child.
   Under the once entrenched principle of male dominance
in marriage, the husband controlled both wife and child.
“[D]ominance [of] the husband,” this Court observed in
1915, “is an ancient principle of our jurisprudence.” Mac-
kenzie v. Hare, 239 U.S. 299, 311 (1915).9 See generally
Brief for Professors of History et al. as Amici Curiae 4–15.
Through the early 20th century, a male citizen automati­
cally conferred U. S. citizenship on his alien wife. Act of
Feb. 10, 1855, ch. 71, §2, 10 Stat. 604; see Kelly v. Owen, 7
Wall. 496, 498 (1869) (the 1855 Act “confers the privileges
of citizenship upon women married to citizens of the United
States”); C. Bredbenner, A Nationality of Her Own:
Women, Marriage, and the Law of Citizenship 15–16, 20–21
(1998). A female citizen, however, was incapable of con­
ferring citizenship on her husband; indeed, she was sub­
ject to expatriation if she married an alien.10 The family of

a citizen or a lawfully admitted permanent resident en­
joyed statutory exemptions from entry requirements, but
only if the citizen or resident was male. See, e.g., Act of
Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1012, §37, 32 Stat. 1221 (wives and
children entering the country to join permanent-resident
aliens and found to have contracted contagious diseases
during transit shall not be deported if the diseases were
easily curable or did not present a danger to others);
S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 415–417 (1950)
(wives exempt from literacy and quota requirements).
And from 1790 until 1934, the foreign-born child of a
married couple gained U. S. citizenship only through the
father.11
  For unwed parents, the father-controls tradition never
held sway. Instead, the mother was regarded as the
child’s natural and sole guardian. At common law, the
mother, and only the mother, was “bound to maintain [a
nonmarital child] as its natural guardian.” 2 J. Kent,
Commentaries on American Law *215–*216 (8th ed.
1854); see Nguyen, 533 U.S., at 91–92 (O’Connor, J.,
dissenting). In line with that understanding, in the early
20th century, the State Department sometimes permitted

lost her citizenship upon marriage to an alien. Act of Mar. 2, 1907, ch.

spite the absence of any statutory authority for the prac­
tice. See Hearings on H. R. 6127 before the House Com­
mittee on Immigration and Naturalization, 76th Cong., 1st
Sess., 43, 431 (1940) (hereinafter 1940 Hearings); 39 Op.
Atty. Gen. 397, 397–398 (1939); 39 Op. Atty. Gen. 290, 291

guinis Citizenship and the Legal Construction of Family,
Race, and Nation, 123 Yale L. J. 2134, 2199–2205 (2014)
(hereinafter Collins).
   In the 1940 Act, Congress discarded the father-controls
assumption concerning married parents, but codified the
mother-as-sole-guardian perception regarding unmarried
parents. The Roosevelt administration, which proposed
§1409, explained: “[T]he mother [of a nonmarital child]
stands in the place of the father . . . [,] has a right to
the custody and control of such a child as against the
putative father, and is bound to maintain it as its natu-
ral guardian.” 1940 Hearings 431 (internal quotation
marks omitted).
   This unwed-mother-as-natural-guardian notion renders
§1409’s gender-based residency rules understandable.
Fearing that a foreign-born child could turn out “more
alien than American in character,” the administration
believed that a citizen parent with lengthy ties to the
United States would counteract the influence of the alien
parent. Id., at 426–427. Concern about the attachment of
foreign-born children to the United States explains the
treatment of unwed citizen fathers, who, according to the
familiar stereotype, would care little about, and have
scant contact with, their nonmarital children. For unwed
citizen mothers, however, there was no need for a pro­
longed residency prophylactic: The alien father, who might
transmit foreign ways, was presumptively out of the pic­
ture. See id., at 431; Collins 2203 (in “nearly uniform
view” of U. S. officials, “almost invariably,” the mother

  For close to a half century, as earlier observed, see
supra, at 7–8, this Court has viewed with suspicion laws
that rely on “overbroad generalizations about the different
talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females.”
Virginia, 518 U.S., at 533; see Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S., at
643, 648. In particular, we have recognized that if a “stat­
utory objective is to exclude or ‘protect’ members of one
gender” in reliance on “fixed notions concerning [that
gender’s] roles and abilities,” the “objective itself is illegit­
imate.” Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U.S., at 725.
  In accord with this eventual understanding, the Court
has held that no “important [governmental] interest” is
served by laws grounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the
obsolescing view that “unwed fathers [are] invariably less
qualified and entitled than mothers” to take responsibility
for nonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U.S.
380, 382, 394 (1979).12 Overbroad generalizations of that
order, the Court has come to comprehend, have a con­
straining impact, descriptive though they may be of the

in Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 62–64 (2001), recognized
that laws treating fathers and mothers differently “may not constitu­
tionally be applied . . . where the mother and father are in fact similarly
situated with regard to their relationship with the child,” Lehr, 463
U.S., at 267. The “similarly situated” condition was not satisfied in
Lehr, however, for the father in that case had “never established any
custodial, personal, or financial relationship” with the child. Ibid.
   Here, there is no dispute that José Morales formally accepted paren­
tal responsibility for his son during Morales-Santana’s childhood. See
supra, at 5. If subject to the same physical-presence requirements that
applied to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers, José would have been recog­
nized as Morales-Santana’s father “as of the date of birth.” §1409(a);
see §1409(c) (“at birth”).

way many people still order their lives.13 Laws according
or denying benefits in reliance on “[s]tereotypes about
women’s domestic roles,” the Court has observed, may
“creat[e] a self-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that
force[s] women to continue to assume the role of primary
family caregiver.” Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v.
Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 736 (2003). Correspondingly, such
laws may disserve men who exercise responsibility for
raising their children. See ibid. In light of the equal
protection jurisprudence this Court has developed since
1971, see Virginia, 518 U.S., at 531–534, §1409(a) and
(c)’s discrete duration-of-residence requirements for unwed
mothers and fathers who have accepted parental responsi­
bility is stunningly anachronistic.

  In urging this Court nevertheless to reject Morales­
Santana’s equal protection plea, the Government cites

Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 645 (1975). In fact, unwed
fathers assume responsibility for their children in numbers already
large and notably increasing. See Brief for Population and Family
Scholars as Amici Curiae 3, 5–13 (documenting that nonmarital fathers
“are [often] in a parental role at the time of their child’s birth,” and
“most . . . formally acknowledge their paternity either at the hospital or
in the birthing center just after the child is born”); Brief for American

mothers of citizen (or lawful-permanent-resident) children.
430 U.S., at 788–789, and n. 1. Unwed fathers and their
children, asserting their right to equal protection, sought
the same preferences. Id., at 791. Applying minimal
scrutiny (rational-basis review), the Court upheld the
provision, relying on Congress’ “exceptionally broad power”
to admit or exclude aliens. Id., at 792, 794.14 This case,
however, involves no entry preference for aliens. Morales-
Santana claims he is, and since birth has been, a U. S.
citizen. Examining a claim of that order, the Court has
not disclaimed, as it did in Fiallo, the application of an
exacting standard of review. See Nguyen, 533 U.S., at
60–61, 70; Miller, 523 U.S., at 434–435, n. 11 (opinion of
Stevens, J.).
   The provision challenged in Miller and Nguyen as viola­
tive of equal protection requires unwed U. S.-citizen fa­
thers, but not mothers, to formally acknowledge
parenthood of their foreign-born children in order to
transmit their U. S. citizenship to those children. See
§1409(a)(4) (2012 ed.).15 After Miller produced no opinion

   14 In 1986, nine years after the decision in Fiallo, Congress amended

the governing law. The definition of “child” that included offspring of
natural mothers but not fathers was altered to include children born
out of wedlock who established a bona fide parent-child relationship
with their natural fathers. See Immigration Reform and Control Act of
1986, §315(a), 100 Stat. 3439, as amended, 8 U.S. C. §1101(b)(1)(D)

100 Stat. 3657; §8(k), 102 Stat. 2618, now states:
   “The provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (g) of section 1401 of

   “(1) a blood relationship between the person and the father is estab­

16               SESSIONS v. MORALES-SANTANA

                          Opinion of the Court

for the Court, see 523 U.S., at 423, we took up the issue
anew in Nguyen. There, the Court held that imposing a
paternal-acknowledgment requirement on fathers was a
justifiable, easily met means of ensuring the existence of a
biological parent-child relationship, which the mother
establishes by giving birth. See 533 U.S., at 62–63.
Morales-Santana’s challenge does not renew the contest
over §1409’s paternal-acknowledgment requirement
(whether the current version or that in effect in 1970), and
the Government does not dispute that Morales-Santana’s
father, by marrying Morales-Santana’s mother, satisfied
that requirement.
  Unlike the paternal-acknowledgment requirement at
issue in Nguyen and Miller, the physical-presence re­
quirements now before us relate solely to the duration of
the parent’s prebirth residency in the United States, not
to the parent’s filial tie to the child. As the Court of Ap­
peals observed in this case, a man needs no more time in
the United States than a woman “in order to have assimi­
lated citizenship-related values to transmit to [his]
child.” 804 F.3d, at 531. And unlike Nguyen’s parental-
acknowledgment requirement, §1409(a)’s age-calibrated
physical-presence requirements cannot fairly be described
as “minimal.” 533 U.S., at 70.

tional notions of the way women and men are, the Gov­
ernment maintains that the statute serves two important
objectives: (1) ensuring a connection between the child to
become a citizen and the United States and (2) preventing
“statelessness,” i.e., a child’s possession of no citizenship at
all. Even indulging the assumption that Congress intended
§1409 to serve these interests, but see supra, at 9–13,
neither rationale survives heightened scrutiny.
                              1
  We take up first the Government’s assertion that
§1409(a) and (c)’s gender-based differential ensures that a
child born abroad has a connection to the United States of
sufficient strength to warrant conferral of citizenship at
birth. The Government does not contend, nor could it,
that unmarried men take more time to absorb U. S. values
than unmarried women do. See supra, at 16. Instead, it
presents a novel argument, one it did not advance in
Flores-Villar.16
  An unwed mother, the Government urges, is the child’s
only “legally recognized” parent at the time of childbirth.
Brief for Petitioner 9–10, 28–32.17 An unwed citizen fa­
ther enters the scene later, as a second parent. A longer
physical connection to the United States is warranted for
the unwed father, the Government maintains, because of
the “competing national influence” of the alien mother.
Id., at 9–10. Congress, the Government suggests, de­
signed the statute to bracket an unwed U. S.-citizen mother
with a married couple in which both parents are U. S.
——————
  16 In Flores-Villar, the Government asserted only the risk-of­

statelessness rationale, which it repeats here. See Brief for United
States, O. T. 2010, No. 09–5801, at 22–39; infra, at 19–23.
  17 But see §1409(a) (unmarried U. S.-citizen father who satisfies the

physical-presence requirements and, after his child is born, accepts
parental responsibility transmits his citizenship to the child “as of the
date of birth”).

citizens,18 and to align an unwed U. S.-citizen father with
a married couple, one spouse a citizen, the other, an alien.
   Underlying this apparent design is the assumption that
the alien father of a nonmarital child born abroad to a
U. S.-citizen mother will not accept parental responsibil­
ity. For an actual affiliation between alien father and
nonmarital child would create the “competing national
influence” that, according to the Government, justifies
imposing on unwed U. S.-citizen fathers, but not unwed
U. S.-citizen mothers, lengthy physical-presence require­
ments. Hardly gender neutral, see id., at 9, that assump­
tion conforms to the long-held view that unwed fathers
care little about, indeed are strangers to, their children.
See supra, at 9–13. Lump characterization of that kind,
however, no longer passes equal protection inspection.
See supra, at 13–14, and n. 13.
   Accepting, arguendo, that Congress intended the diverse
physical-presence prescriptions to serve an interest in
ensuring a connection between the foreign-born nonmari­
tal child and the United States, the gender-based means
scarcely serve the posited end. The scheme permits the
transmission of citizenship to children who have no tie to
the United States so long as their mother was a U. S.
citizen continuously present in the United States for one
year at any point in her life prior to the child’s birth. The
transmission holds even if the mother marries the child’s
alien father immediately after the child’s birth and never
returns with the child to the United States. At the same
time, the legislation precludes citizenship transmission by
a U. S.-citizen father who falls a few days short of meeting
§1401(a)(7)’s longer physical-presence requirements, even

  18 When a child is born abroad to married parents, both U. S. citizens,

the child ranks as a U. S. citizen at birth if either parent “has had a
residence in the United States or one of its outlying possessions, prior

child’s birth and raises the child in the United States.19
One cannot see in this driven-by-gender scheme the close
means-end fit required to survive heightened scrutiny.
See, e.g., Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U.S. 142,

compensation death-benefits statute presuming widows’
but not widowers’ dependence on their spouse’s earnings);

   The Government maintains that Congress established
the gender-based residency differential in §1409(a) and (c)
to reduce the risk that a foreign-born child of a U. S. citi­
zen would be born stateless. Brief for Petitioner 33. This
risk, according to the Government, was substantially
greater for the foreign-born child of an unwed U. S.-citizen
mother than it was for the foreign-born child of an unwed
U. S.-citizen father. Ibid. But there is little reason to
believe that a statelessness concern prompted the diverse
physical-presence requirements. Nor has the Government
shown that the risk of statelessness disproportionately
endangered the children of unwed mothers.
   As the Court of Appeals pointed out, with one excep­

   19 Brief for Respondent 26, n. 9, presents this example: “Child A is

born in Germany and raised there by his U. S.-citizen mother who
spent only a year of her life in the United States during infancy; Child
B is born in Germany and is legitimated and raised in Germany by a
U. S.-citizen father who spent his entire life in the United States before
leaving for Germany one week before his nineteenth birthday. Not­
withstanding the fact that Child A’s ‘legal relationship’ with his U. S.­
citizen mother may have been established ‘at the moment of birth,’ and
Child B’s ‘legal relationship’ with his U. S.-citizen father may have been
established a few hours later, Child B is more likely than Child A to
learn English and assimilate U. S. values. Nevertheless, under the
discriminatory scheme, only Child A obtains U. S. citizenship at birth.”

tion,20 nothing in the congressional hearings and reports
on the 1940 and 1952 Acts “refer[s] to the problem of
statelessness for children born abroad.” 804 F.3d, at 532–
533. See Collins 2205, n. 283 (author examined “many
hundreds of pre-1940 administrative memos . . . de­
fend[ing] or explain[ing] recognition of the nonmarital
foreign-born children of American mothers as citizens”; of
the hundreds, “exactly one memo by a U. S. official . . .
mentions the risk of statelessness for the foreign-born
nonmarital children of American mothers as a concern”).
Reducing the incidence of statelessness was the express
goal of other sections of the 1940 Act. See 1940 Hearings
430 (“stateless[ness]” is “object” of section on foundlings).
The justification for §1409’s gender-based dichotomy,
however, was not the child’s plight, it was the mother’s
role as the “natural guardian” of a nonmarital child. See
supra, at 9–13; Collins 2205 (“[T]he pronounced gender

   20 A Senate Report dated January 29, 1952, is the sole exception.

That Report relates that a particular problem of statelessness accounts
for the 1952 Act’s elimination of a 1940 Act provision the State De­
partment had read to condition a citizen mother’s ability to transmit
nationality to her child on the father’s failure to legitimate the child
prior to the child’s 18th birthday. See 1940 Act, §205, 54 Stat. 1140
(“In the absence of . . . legitimation or adjudication [during the child’s
minority], . . . the child” born abroad to an unmarried citizen mother
“shall be held to have acquired at birth [the mother’s] nationality
status.” (emphasis added)). The 1952 Act eliminated this provision,
allowing the mother to transmit citizenship independent of the father’s
actions. S. Rep. No. 1137, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 39 (1952) (“This provi­
sion establish[es] the child’s nationality as that of the [citizen] mother
regardless of legitimation or establishment of paternity . . . .” (emphasis
added)). This sole reference to a statelessness problem does not touch
or concern the different physical-presence requirements carried over
from the 1940 Act into the 1952 Act.

“hypothesiz[e] or inven[t]” governmental purposes for
gender classifications “post hoc in response to litigation.”
Virginia, 518 U.S., at 533, 535–536.
   Infecting the Government’s risk-of-statelessness argu­
ment is an assumption without foundation. “[F]oreign
laws that would put the child of the U. S.-citizen mother at
risk of statelessness (by not providing for the child to
acquire the father’s citizenship at birth),” the Government
asserts, “would protect the child of the U. S.-citizen father
against statelessness by providing that the child would
take his mother’s citizenship.” Brief for Petitioner 35.
The Government, however, neglected to expose this sup­
posed “protection” to a reality check. Had it done so, it
would have recognized the formidable impediments placed
by foreign laws on an unwed mother’s transmission of
citizenship to her child. See Brief for Scholars on State­
lessness as Amici Curiae 13–22, A1–A15.
   Experts who have studied the issue report that, at the
time relevant here, in “at least thirty countries,” citizen
mothers generally could not transmit their citizenship to
nonmarital children born within the mother’s country.
Id., at 14; see id., at 14–17. “[A]s many as forty-five coun­
tries,” they further report, “did not permit their female
citizens to assign nationality to a nonmarital child born
outside the subject country with a foreign father.” Id., at
18; see id., at 18–21. In still other countries, they also
observed, there was no legislation in point, leaving the
nationality of nonmarital children uncertain. Id., at 21–22;
see Sandifer, A Comparative Study of Laws Relating to
Nationality at Birth and to Loss of Nationality, 29 Am. J.
Int’l L. 248, 256, 258 (1935) (of 79 nations studied, about
half made no specific provision for the nationality of non-
marital children). Taking account of the foreign laws
actually in force, these experts concluded, “the risk of
parenting stateless children abroad was, as of [1940 and
22            SESSIONS v. MORALES-SANTANA

                     Opinion of the Court

1952], and remains today, substantial for unmarried U. S.
fathers, a risk perhaps greater than that for unmarried
U. S. mothers.” Brief for Scholars on Statelessness as
Amici Curiae 9–10; see id., at 38–39. One can hardly
characterize as gender neutral a scheme allegedly attend­
ing to the risk of statelessness for children of unwed U. S.­
citizen mothers while ignoring the same risk for children
of unwed U. S.-citizen fathers.
   In 2014, the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) undertook a ten-year project to elimi­
nate statelessness by 2024. See generally UNHCR, End­
ing Statelessness Within 10 Years, online at http://
www.unhcr.org/en-us/protection/statelessness/546217229/
special-report-ending-statelessness-10-years.html (all
Internet materials as last visited June 9, 2017). Cogni­
zant that discrimination against either mothers or fathers
in citizenship and nationality laws is a major cause of
statelessness, the Commissioner has made a key compo­
nent of its project the elimination of gender discrimination
in such laws. UNHCR, The Campaign To End Stateless­
ness: April 2016 Update 1 (referring to speech of UNHCR
“highlight[ing] the issue of gender discrimination in the
nationality laws of 27 countries—a major cause of state­
lessness globally”), online at http://www.unhcr.org/ibelong/

ty Laws and Statelessness 2016, p. 1 (“Ensuring gender
equality in nationality laws can mitigate the risks of
statelessness.”), online at http://www.refworld.org/docid/
56de83ca4.html. In this light, we cannot countenance risk
of statelessness as a reason to uphold, rather than strike
out, differential treatment of unmarried women and
men with regard to transmission of citizenship to their
children.

persuasive” justification for §1409(a) and (c)’s gender­

  While the equal protection infirmity in retaining a
longer physical-presence requirement for unwed fathers
than for unwed mothers is clear, this Court is not
equipped to grant the relief Morales-Santana seeks, i.e.,
extending to his father (and, derivatively, to him) the
benefit of the one-year physical-presence term §1409(c)
reserves for unwed mothers.
  There are “two remedial alternatives,” our decisions
instruct, Westcott, 443 U.S., at 89 (quoting Welsh v. United
States, 398 U.S. 333, 361 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring
in result)), when a statute benefits one class (in this case,
unwed mothers and their children), as §1409(c) does, and
excludes another from the benefit (here, unwed fathers
and their children). “[A] court may either declare [the
statute] a nullity and order that its benefits not extend to
the class that the legislature intended to benefit, or it may
extend the coverage of the statute to include those who are
aggrieved by exclusion.” Westcott, 443 U.S., at 89 (quot­
ing Welsh, 398 U.S., at 361 (opinion of Harlan, J.)).22
——————
   21 JUSTICE THOMAS, joined by JUSTICE ALITO, sees our equal protection

ruling as “unnecessary,” post, at 1, given our remedial holding. But, “as
we have repeatedly emphasized, discrimination itself . . . perpetuat[es]
‘archaic and stereotypic notions’ ” incompatible with the equal treat­
ment guaranteed by the Constitution. Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S.
728, 739 (1984) (quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458
U.S. 718, 725 (1982)).
   22 After silently following the path Justice Harlan charted in Welsh v.

United States, 398 U.S. 333 (1970), in several cases involving gender-
based discrimination, see, e.g., Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S., at 642, 653
(extending benefits); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 690–691,
and n. 25 (1973) ( plurality opinion) (same), the Court unanimously
24               SESSIONS v. MORALES-SANTANA

                         Opinion of the Court

“[W]hen the ‘right invoked is that to equal treatment,’ the
appropriate remedy is a mandate of equal treatment, a
result that can be accomplished by withdrawal of benefits
from the favored class as well as by extension of benefits
to the excluded class.” Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S. 728,
740 (1984) (quoting Iowa-Des Moines Nat. Bank v. Ben-
nett, 284 U.S. 239, 247 (1931); emphasis deleted). “How
equality is accomplished . . . is a matter on which the
Constitution is silent.” Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc.,
560 U.S. 413, 426–427 (2010).23
   The choice between these outcomes is governed by the
legislature’s intent, as revealed by the statute at hand.
See id., at 427 (“On finding unlawful discrimination, . . .
courts may attempt, within the bounds of their institu­
tional competence, to implement what the legislature
would have willed had it been apprised of the constitu­
tional infirmity.”). See also Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood

adopted his formulation in Califano v. Westcott, 443 U.S. 76 (1979).
See id., at 89–90 (opinion for the Court); id., at 94–95 (Powell, J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part). The appropriate remedy,
the Westcott majority held, was extension to unemployed mothers of
federal family-aid unemployment benefits provided by statute only for
families of unemployed fathers. Id., at 90–93. In the dissent’s view,
nullification was the proper course. Id., at 94–96.
   23 Because the manner in which a State eliminates discrimination “is

an issue of state law,” Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U.S. 7, 18 (1975), upon
finding state statutes constitutionally infirm, we have generally re­
manded to permit state courts to choose between extension and invali­
dation. See Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc., 560 U.S. 413, 427 (2010).
In doing so, we have been explicit in leaving open on remand the option
of removal of a benefit, as opposed to extension. See, e.g., Orr v. Orr,
440 U.S. 268, 283–284 (1979) (leaving to state courts remedy for
unconstitutional imposition of alimony obligations on husbands but not
wives); Stanton, 421 U.S., at 17–18 (how to eliminate unconstitutional
age differential, for child-support purposes, between male and female
children, is “an issue of state law to be resolved by the Utah courts”).

intent”).24
   Ordinarily, we have reiterated, “extension, rather than
nullification, is the proper course.” Westcott, 443 U.S., at
89. Illustratively, in a series of cases involving federal
financial assistance benefits, the Court struck discrimina­
tory exceptions denying benefits to discrete groups, which
meant benefits previously denied were extended. See, e.g.,
Goldfarb, 430 U.S., at 202–204, 213–217 (plurality opin­
ion) (survivors’ benefits), aff ’g 396 F. Supp. 308, 309
(EDNY 1975) (per curiam); Jimenez v. Weinberger, 417
U.S. 628, 630–631, and n. 2, 637–638 (1974) (disability
benefits); Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U.S.
528, 529–530, 538 (1973) (food stamps); Frontiero, 411
U.S., at 678–679, and n. 2, 691, and n. 25 (plurality opin­
ion) (military spousal benefits). Here, however, the dis­
criminatory exception consists of favorable treatment for a
discrete group (a shorter physical-presence requirement
for unwed U. S.-citizen mothers giving birth abroad).
Following the same approach as in those benefits cases—
——————
  24 We note, however, that a defendant convicted under a law classify­

ing on an impermissible basis may assail his conviction without regard
to the manner in which the legislature might subsequently cure the
infirmity. In Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104 (1972), for
example, the defendant participated in a civil rights demonstration in
front of a school. Convicted of violating a local “antipicketing” ordi­
nance that exempted “peaceful picketing of any school involved in a
labor dispute,” he successfully challenged his conviction on equal
protection grounds. Id., at 107 (internal quotation marks omitted). It
was irrelevant to the Court’s decision whether the legislature likely
would have cured the constitutional infirmity by excising the labor-
dispute exemption. In fact, the legislature had done just that subse­
quent to the defendant’s conviction. Ibid., and n. 2. “Necessarily,” the
Court observed, “we must consider the facial constitutionality of the
ordinance in effect when [the defendant] was arrested and convicted.”
Id., at 107, n. 2. See also Welsh, 398 U.S., at 361–364 (Harlan, J.,
concurring in result) (reversal required even if, going forward, Congress
would cure the unequal treatment by extending rather than invalidat­
ing the criminal proscription).
26                 SESSIONS v. MORALES-SANTANA

                          Opinion of the Court

striking the discriminatory exception—leads here to ex­
tending the general rule of longer physical-presence re­
quirements to cover the previously favored group.
   The Court has looked to Justice Harlan’s concurring
opinion in Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S., at 361–367,
in considering whether the legislature would have struck
an exception and applied the general rule equally to all, or
instead, would have broadened the exception to cure the
equal protection violation. In making this assessment, a
court should “ ‘measure the intensity of commitment to the
residual policy’ ”—the main rule, not the exception—“ ‘and
consider the degree of potential disruption of the statutory
scheme that would occur by extension as opposed to abro­
gation.’ ” Heckler, 465 U.S., at 739, n. 5 (quoting Welsh,
398 U.S., at 365 (opinion of Harlan, J.)).
   The residual policy here, the longer physical-presence
requirement stated in §§1401(a)(7) and 1409, evidences
Congress’ recognition of “the importance of residence in
this country as the talisman of dedicated attachment.”
Rogers v. Bellei, 401 U.S. 815, 834 (1971); see Weedin v.
Chin Bow, 274 U.S. 657, 665–666 (1927) (Congress “at­
tached more importance to actual residence in the United
States as indicating a basis for citizenship than it did to
descent. . . . [T]he heritable blood of citizenship was thus
associated unmistakeably with residence within the coun­
try which was thus recognized as essential to full citizen­
ship.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). And the poten­
tial for “disruption of the statutory scheme” is large. For if
§1409(c)’s one-year dispensation were extended to unwed
citizen fathers, would it not be irrational to retain the
longer term when the U. S.-citizen parent is married?
Disadvantageous treatment of marital children in compar­
ison to nonmarital children is scarcely a purpose one can
sensibly attribute to Congress.25

                          Opinion of the Court

  Although extension of benefits is customary in federal
benefit cases, see supra, at 23–24, n. 22, 25, all indicators
in this case point in the opposite direction.26 Put to the
choice, Congress, we believe, would have abrogated
§1409(c)’s exception, preferring preservation of the general
rule.27
                             V
  The gender-based distinction infecting §§1401(a)(7) and
1409(a) and (c), we hold, violates the equal protection
principle, as the Court of Appeals correctly ruled. For the
reasons stated, however, we must adopt the remedial
course Congress likely would have chosen “had it been
apprised of the constitutional infirmity.” Levin, 560 U.S.,
at 427. Although the preferred rule in the typical case is
——————
subject to the same heightened scrutiny as distinctions based on
gender. Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461 (1988).
  26 In crafting the INA in 1952, Congress considered, but did not adopt,

an amendment that would have applied the shorter one-year continu­
ous physical-presence requirement now contained in §1409(c) to all
foreign-born children of parents with different nationalities. See
S. 2842, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., §301(a)(5) (1952).
  27 Compare with the remedial issue presented here suits under Title

VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 challenging laws prescribing terms
and conditions of employment applicable to women only, e.g., minimum
wage, premium pay, rest breaks, or lunch breaks. Most courts, perhaps
mindful of the mixed motives implicated in passage of such legislation
(some conceiving the laws as protecting women, others, as discouraging
employers from hiring women), and, taking into account the economic
burdens extension would impose on employers, have invalidated the
provisions. See, e.g., Homemakers, Inc., of Los Angeles v. Division of
Industrial Welfare, 509 F.2d 20, 22–23 (CA9 1974), aff ’g 356 F. Supp.
1111 (1973) (ND Cal. 1973); Burns v. Rohr Corp., 346 F. Supp. 994,

to extend favorable treatment, see Westcott, 443 U.S., at
89–90, this is hardly the typical case.28 Extension here
would render the special treatment Congress prescribed in
§1409(c), the one-year physical-presence requirement for
U. S.-citizen mothers, the general rule, no longer an excep­
tion. Section 1401(a)(7)’s longer physical-presence re­
quirement, applicable to a substantial majority of children
born abroad to one U. S.-citizen parent and one foreign-
citizen parent, therefore, must hold sway.29 Going for­
ward, Congress may address the issue and settle on a
uniform prescription that neither favors nor disadvantages
any person on the basis of gender. In the interim,
as the Government suggests, §1401(a)(7)’s now-five-
year requirement should apply, prospectively, to children
born to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers. See Brief for Peti­
tioner 12, 51; Reply Brief 19, n. 3.

 PETITIONER v. LUIS RAMON MORALES-SANTANA
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

                         [June 12, 2017] 


  JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE ALITO joins,
concurring in the judgment in part.
  The Court today holds that we are “not equipped to”
remedy the equal protection injury that respondent claims
his father suffered under the Immigration and Nationality
Act (INA) of 1952. Ante, at 23. I agree with that holding.
As the majority concludes, extending 8 U.S. C. §1409(c)’s
1-year physical presence requirement to unwed citizen
fathers (as respondent requests) is not, under this Court’s
precedent, an appropriate remedy for any equal protection
violation. See ante, at 23. Indeed, I am skeptical that we
even have the “power to provide relief of the sort requested
in this suit—namely, conferral of citizenship on a basis
other than that prescribed by Congress.” Tuan Anh Nguyen
v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 73 (2001) (Scalia, J., joined by
THOMAS, J., concurring) (citing Miller v. Albright, 523
